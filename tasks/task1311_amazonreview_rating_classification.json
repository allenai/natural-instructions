However, after using it a while, now I'd like to clone it for use in other parts of my house! It has multiple choices -- bright white, white and a nice off white. I use the bright white during the day and the off-white is better for working in the evening. The brightness is adjustable by just touching the level button, which I can use as the sunshine or lack thereof outside my window changes. It has a USB port, which is AMAZING and perfect for keeping my smartphone charged. It even has a timer feature I can touch before leaving my sewing area in case I get tied up elsewhere and can't come back to it right away. I appreciate how easy it is to adjust where you want that light to shine by just moving the top piece. The cord is also quite long reaching a good distance. \n Rating: 1",

I totally recommand thia maby monitor. You can also have more than one camera set up but i didnt try it. No need for me Almost a year after purchase, i had a small issue with my parental monitor. Would charge properly. I wouldnt say this was a defective issue of the monitor but more a usage issue (Probably bb that keep pulling the cord). I contacted them. Their costumer service is amazing and also the people working for them. Same day responses to multiple emails and they were very helpful and very fast.

So I tried this one. It doesn’t look bad and temperature seems to be relatively close to accuracy. The “only” drawback is that if you stare at it anything further than 45 degrees from the center, the screen starts to look distorted, meaning, you can barely see the numbers. When you’re looking straight to it, then it looks great. I played a little with the brightness of screen and it didn’t do any good. I think it will depend on where you set it on but just bare in mind that if your angle or view is wider than 45 degrees, this may not be as useful as it is designed to be. \n Rating: 3",

OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different.

            "input": "Review: I researched for around half an hour to make sure I was getting a Velcro style tape that I can use for cable management in my home office. I wanted to make sure I got one that would hold very strongly and provide enough material for future applications as well. My only worry was that these would not hold strongly, but they are rock solid. The second I got them out of the bag they shipped in, I had to exert a decent amount of effort to separate them just by the small contact patched they had in shipping. Make no mistake, the effort is a pro, not a con. Unfortunately it is stronger than the adhesive it comes with and after trying on multiple surfaces, I have determined it is not a sufficient adhesive for the strength of the loops. This is unfortunate because it otherwise is a great product. I don't intend to use the remainder of the roll, and unless the seller reaches out to resolve, I'll just consider it a $12 loss and move on to a different cable management solution. \n Rating: 2",

You get any oil on it and it slips in your hand so you constantly have to wipe it off after each spray. Also, it is NOT ergonomic by any means. You have to really bunch your fingers and hold it at the top so your fingers don't slip and to depress the button - or you need long fingers. The button HURTS! Hard grooved plastic and a flat edge - that digs into your finger every time you press it. And since it's not aerosol, you need to press it a lot. It does not spray for me evenly at all - even on first use, I got maybe 2 full sprays, then it went right to a thin stream of oil, with intermittent spray. And when it does spray, it gets everywhere! Lands on the oven, lands on your hand, a lot in the air... will have to go back to a metal air pump spray. \n Rating: 2",

The plot comes right out of the headlines but it didn't seem as good as book 1. Vivi is the mother of a son who doesn't speak. They are at a mall when a terrorist attack happens. She is helped to escape by Jed (an FBI agent) and he takes on the responsibility of their safety. The terrorists target the boy as they think he heard or saw something while hiding in a cupboard. There are lots of twists to keep the suspense going. I gave it only three stars as I didn't feel the romance. I do recommend the series. \n Rating: 3",

Customer service has confirmed that the AirMega will not work on my wifi network or any network that uses the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. This leaves out my new Eero mesh network, and would have also failed on my prior non-mesh network because it too used the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. After reading some of the other complaints by reviewers, it appears that AirMega may be knowingly selling a wifi connected air purifier that does not work on modern common place wifi networks. The published suggested solution of slowing down your entire wifi network by disabling 5ghz is not a viable solution or a workaround in my book. Also, one smaller point is that the air purifier has 4 speed settings. The top two settings are very loud. Other air purifiers I own (BlueAir for example) are reasonably quiet on all except the maximum fan speed setting. \n Rating: 2",

It is low and it tends to push your breast toward the center which causes a bulge. I like the back support and I think it will be more comfortable after I get used to it. Will wear for a week before deciding if I will keep it. Update: after wearing it for a few days I have concluded this bra is great for small busted women....however, full figure women might find the front coverage not adequate.

I loved the idea, but dragging out conversations and no notice of location changes made it hard to follow. I love learning new words, but it felt as if every page needed a thesaurus. Perhaps the other series written are not this way. Honestly, I just began to find it too much trouble to read.

When I do help in the kitchen I have to follow a recipe to the letter. This book was beyond perfect. It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author. Everyone who wants to make baby food NEEDS this book! \n Rating: 1",

I supposed this could be a fault of the vent louvers themselves but other vent clip phone holders don’t suffer from this problem because they hold the phone unit very close/flush against the vent itself....allowing very little side to side movement. By comparison, this design has the actual charger/phone holder being held out a full 3-4” away from the vent. Good for airflow, but fails to serve the purpose of the unit itself as the phone will just flop back and forth constantly. Very annoying. Not recommended. \n Rating: 2",

I had previously purchased some other brand chinese LED lights that did not work at all (there's three rows of LED on that one.. avoid them..).. I eventually settled on these even after reading reviews. At first when installing.. only 1 row on one worked, and both on the other.. the 1 with one row had a pin not connecting nicely (ground).. that was easily bent into a better position and fixed. I taped the connector once over with electrical tape, then used a flat head (with some struggling) to push the connectors deeper into the mirror one at a time. Making sure the lights are working I pushed the lens into the mirror, they DID NOT snap tight.. if I slightly pushed it they'd come out.. this was a no go.. what is happening is the latch on the LED lens is not seating itself.. so what I did is pushed it in all the way, and then on the mirror side (with mirror turned up and away) I used my flat head and forced the latch to seat itself (it takes some force, it won't break the latch) and once it's seated.. the lens isn't going ANYWHERE, highway, bumps or not.. so far so good. They fit and look GREAT. Just a little hassle with the wiring, and getting the latch to seat itself so they stay securely put. \n Rating: 2",

The pacing is slow and light on action, but does make up for it in character development as well as some stunning scenery. The family mansion is to die for. The plot is filled with clichés about the nerdy high school girl who is bullied and yearns to be popular but is just to damn quirky to fit in including the stupid side kick who is loyal but likewise an outcast. However the thing that bothered me most was the not so subtle occult theme throughout the movie. In the end the girl ends up having essentially the power of a God and she is tasked with saving the planet from the evil scourge of humanity...oh and she's gonna birth the savior as well. I was confused as to whether she was gonna save the planet with her powers or usher in the savior as the prophecy foretold. Whatever, the movie abruptly ends with her declaring she wants to help after resurrecting and healing several friends who had just had an accident. I felt the acting was on par with the budget which wasn't much I'm guessing. Some decent actors who's careers are over and they just don't know it yet lol...There's a whole sequence in there about how evil humans are destroying the planet and global warming and such which was a turn off to me as well. And the mom kinda turns into a brutal dictator mid way thru which makes you want to hate her...but she had reasons I guess. Seriously the location scout for this movie deserves a raise. \n Rating: 2",

Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him. \n Rating: 2",

First, the lever had to be cut to fit so it wouldn't hit the refill tube...that I was ready for. But then I discovered that there was no way the square rubber gasket would fit into the square hole in the tank, it was way too tight. I ended up putting it in from the inside, and was able to tighten up the plastic nut enough to hold the handle assembly securely. The handle on the old, stock unit, which lasted 15 years, was made of pot-metal, and the little pocket that the lever fits into had split open at the pressure/wear point. The new handle is made of plastic, with a slightly different cam mechanism. I would bet that it won't last nearly as long...time will tell. The bottom line: Spend the extra $10-12 to get a more durable handle that you can install in about 2 minutes with no jury-rigging hassles. \n Rating: 2",

Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation.

Then it seemed to me there wasn’t enough arch support in them, I happen to have high arches and these were virtually flat. Also the heel was tight and the sandal pad itself was really hard!!! My feet hurt so bad after wearing these just twice for very short bouts. Absolutely disappointed & returning.** My friend had the same brand/size everything & hers were WAY different so idk what’s going on here. ** I think I’m just going to go into my REI to buy a sandal so I can try it on first, even the chacos.

The pen test, and mindfulness pages, however, ARE included in the page numbers. they're located at the end, and not terribly obstructive. But slightly annoying.

The tripod is not super sturdy but it does the job - we haven't had it fall or anything but it seems like it could pretty easily. The light does adjust from side to side as well so you can rotate it around. It can be changed from a cooler or warm light, this helped when using it with my camera but when I used my phone I didn't notice as much of a difference (I assume my phone tries to autocorrect the white balance anyways so that might be why).

Perhaps the best thing about this screwdriver is the fact you can charge it via USB. That's the reason I got it but I am debating returning it as it falls short in every category. My black and decker I got for 18 dollars is more ergonomic than this, even if they have a proprietary charger. Edit: I just used this on a jobsite all day and I have to say, the twisting didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, the led light is perfect, and although it doesn't take double sided bits I can forgive that as it chargers via usb.

            "input": "Review: I am disabled from terminal cancer, and pretty much doomed to live out the remainder of my days under home hospice and laid up on my comfortable couch. My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for \"breastfeeding\" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product! Keep in mind, I've only had it for only three days or so, so I cannot speak on item longevity. \n Rating: 2",

First, one of the candles did not work and as others have noted, it isn't as easy to get them straight as one might hope. However, my big issue is the dullness of the light. I haven't noticed anyone else mentioning this, so perhaps it is just my set, but considering that they are LEDs, the lack of any brightness was very disappointing.

I have unfortunately had to interact with Gigabyte's support/RMA process all for a fan on the cooler block that has an internal defect causing it to make a grinding noise constantly. This started happening within days of receiving and installing the card. First, to get to the RMA, you have at minimum two accounts to create and tickets to submit, one for tech support, another for RMA. Then they will ask you to send in the entire card for what could be a fairly simple swap of a fan, rather than just sending the fan. They will also drop the ball on communication, so you will have to hound them for answers. At this point I expect to replace the fan on my own dime. In short, despite the fan issue, this card has been pretty reliable for being so easily OC-able and I would probably choose this model over what else is available out there right now, unless I planned on setting up a custom water cooling setup. Dealing with the inferior fan quality control issue, including interaction with technical support, RMA dept., and customer service, has been far less than ideal. \n Rating: 3",

If that's all I was reviewing, this product would have five stars. That being said, since I have set up the printer, which took around 8 hours in total from unwrapping to starting my first print, I have had multiple parts failures. The z-stop sensor was bad out of the box. I contacted the seller and they paid me back for the new one I had to purchase. The temperature sensor for the hot end died within the first month and had to be replaced. Now at the end of the second month both of the board cooling fans have failed, resulting in heat damage to the board and the loss of my heated bed power supply, as well as the connector for the x axis motor. Again, the seller was quick to respond and is sending a new control board. The only complaint that I have is about the quality of the parts that were shipped with the product. \n Rating: 3",

            "input": "Review: This is such a convenient product in theory, unfortunately, it fits no desk or counter that I have so I stuck it on the bookshelf in my office. I’ve also hung it over my bathroom towel rack, when needed, because my bathroom never has enough outlets. It really needs to have a spring loaded lever that is as wide as the unit itself. Currently the lever is about a half inch, which means it doesn’t touch anything I own other than my bookshelf, and therefore will not attach in a stable manner. (My counters aren’t wide enough to even touch the lever and my antique desks are too deep to slide it onto). The lever spring is very strong, however, but because it is so thin, the power strip moves position every time you touch it! Possibly having a wider lever and some flat wings with rubber grips on each side, of the top portion of the strip, would prevent this, at least some. The USB and C ports work perfectly and quicker than I expected them to. The LED indicator light on top is so dim, that I have a terrible time telling whether or not the strip is on! The only time I can visualize it is when it’s dark. And there is no labeling that tellers you which is which, either. At least not that I’ve seen (I’m visually impaired so this may just be me). Having so many places to plug in power cords and USB devices is extremely convenient and I love the concept! I love that the strip is at waist height and my cords are not all over the floor. If this design is improved, I’d eventually buy several more. Until then, however, it gets one of my lowest ratings. The seller doesn’t contact you back, the way they promise to, even after sending a direct email to my inbox, requesting that I contact them if dissatisfied. This is extremely frustrating. I’ll eventually rig the lever so that it covers more surface area and holds onto more items, but have yet to have the time. I hope that the developers/shippers, whichever, can look into this, and design this item with either a wider lever or other attachment options so that it can be more useful in more places and prevent it from moving with every touch. \n Rating: 2",

It also argued with charging at first, needing babysat while charging to ensure it was being accepted or something.

The center part should be black so the corners will be slightly dimmer than the mustard color in the pic - but size and position of it is accurate. This one is going back- I hope the replacement is better but I am not confident in it. For $1,200 this should be greatly reduced and WTH is up with the flip-phone sounding speakers it has? Gaming is ok on it, but it is nice for desktop space for multiple applications. so it gets 2 stars. \n Rating: 1",

Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together. \n Rating: 1",

But less than a month after using the carrier, the whole back tire piece fell off the carrier in transit to pick up the bike. Have no visual of the carrier when It is attached to the receiver on the back of my RV. Since the back tire part is the most lightweight piece of the carrier did not notice exactly when that piece fell off. Swagman, required me to provide pictures of the carrier. I attached a pic of the carrier assembled on the rack as well as all the parts for the second bike carrier that were still in the box. Stated in the form at Swagman.net that the parts for the second back tire part of the carrier were missing in the original shipment. Swagman sent me ONLY the back tire well but not the belt and buckle. When I called about that the woman was very curt over the phone. The strap and the buckle were sent but no directions on how to attach the strap to the tire well. In the assembly directions on Swagman.net there is no mention of attaching that part. A tech staff at Swagman told me that in the original shipment the belt and buckle are already attached to the tire well. When I asked if that part could be shipped assembled he said that wasn't possible. Googled you tube for directions without success. Basically I have a non-working carrier and the manufacturer doesn't seem to care that there's a major blip in providing good customer service. Unfortunately, there is no other bike carrier that is rated for transport for the back of an RV. But I cannot recommend this carrier due to the issue with pieces falling off the carrier when moving the trailer to pick up the bike. \n Rating: 3",

            "input": "Review: The atomic function on the clock didn’t work even after setting it by a window where it showed the strongest signal strength all evening and overnight. When I realized in the morning that it hadn’t synced, I tried looking for a signal manually (a few times, too!), but no luck with that either. These methods had previously worked for another Marathon model (slim jumbo wall clock), when it took around 30 minutes to sync (again, after some manual intervention). I’m in the Bay Area, if it helps. Anyway, after all attempts at automatic and manual syncing failed, I was forced to program the clock manually — the process was a bit tedious, if you ask me. Bought it in the white & gold, and it looks and works fine otherwise — as a regular digital desk clock, I mean, just not as an atomic one. And since it was rather cheap, I won’t complain *too* much. I’m actually glad that it’s not constantly backlit (with a bright light), because why would I want my bedroom bathed in neon orange light all night when I’m trying to sleep?! The screen lights up for a few seconds at the touch of a button (on top), so when I do want to tell the time at night, it’s not that complicated a process at all. The numbers are large enough and easy for me to read. The clarity of the numbers does depend on the viewing angle, as some reviewers have mentioned. The size of the clock is appropriate for a desk/alarm clock, IMO. Haven’t used it as an alarm clock, so have no insight to offer in that regard. So, all said and done, my biggest, and *only* grievance is that its absolute *main*, *featured* functionality, is totally non-functional and useless. Now here’s hoping that in order to get my money’s worth, it at least lasts longer than a year! 🤞🏼 \n Rating: 2",

This second one came in a fancy zippered bag, while the other was a regular taped close bag. Which was very odd as I'd expect more continuity in companies. When I got this item off my porch the box was SOAKED, not just a little wet, but so wet it was crumbling under my fingers. I still kept some hope, because maybe the fur was in a sealed bag?? It was not, the bag was open ended and filled with water. Normally during rainy and snowy days the packages I receive are wrapped up tight in a bag or other wrap so prevent damage. So I had been feeling comfortable in ordering despite the oncoming snow and not being home. I'll have to change that policy now. \n Rating: 2",

I did have to tighten the screw at the top with a small wrench to hold the Yeti in position (right now I have it up diagonally). I haven't noticed any drooping but it's only been couple days and I've been moving it around, but overall I'm satisfied with this arm for the Yeti mic! \n Rating: 2",

This product is perfect for this problem. I bought this set to add to our collection. We have 6 of these pacifiers, but for some reason we lose them all at once. I previously bought a holder that required me to put the loop through the pacifier hole. That means the fabric of the holder was against my babies face. I can’t imagine having wet fabric pressed against your face being comfortable. When I found this model I jumped on buying it. I will warn you that the holder is translucent and is already attached to one of the pacifiers. I didn’t realize this and thought I threw it away. It’s easy to take off and more to another one. I absolutely love it. I took a star off because the clasp is just so bulky. I wish I t was a bit smaller because against a little baby it takes up most of his torso. Other than that I highly recommend this product. \n Rating: 2",

The book is not structured for the beginner and often enough, if you are a beginner you will find your self lost in a maze of analogies and technical jargon. For example, the author tries to convey the best technique for sound programming in Python, but He goes off on a tangent and provided you with some other details of how not to program in Python. If you are a beginner, you will become lost, and won't be able to track back on some of these examples. At the end of the chapter, you will have to read it again in order to grasp a clearer understanding of how Python works. But then again, Python is all about simplicity, this book is not simple at all. The coding examples provided also does not provide you with enough details on real life and practical usage of how it is applied in the real world, and does not quite teach the beginner about its inner workings. \n Rating: 3",

            "input": "Review: On the plus side, the light is super bright (350 lumens) and the horn is very loud. Also able to go up to 2 weeks without recharging the batteries. The top of my unit got wet because of rain. The horn button seems fairly water-tight, but the top of the main unit's housing is another story. After 14 hours of drying-out there is still condensation inside the clear plastic covering of the solar panel. Also, horn electronics have shorted -- horn goes off randomly when plugged in or just produces an anemic chirp. There is also water leaking from the horn jack receptacle which entered through the solar panel cover. Leaving the unit in the sun all day doesn't recharge batteries, so I'm thinking the solar feature is more of a gimmick than anything useful. As a guesstimate, using the light with full-beam about 1 to 1.5 hours a week (with very liberal use of the horn whenever riding) requires the unit to be charged once every 2 weeks. A red light flashes when batteries are running low. Charging takes about 6 - 8 hours. As another nitpick, it's really annoying to cycle through 4 light modes just to turn the unit off. Depending on your riding style, the horn button clasp may be prone to slip when you press it. The horn clasp is a rubber band-like and not a bolt. Since most horn-light combos are like this, I wouldn't deduct points for this. Just something to be aware of. Overall it's a good light, but it's not rainproof or waterproof. And the solar panel feature is possibly a sales gimmick. If you decide to purchase, don't allow it to get wet! \n Rating: 2",

But to be honest, I never actually expected a full 10 hours anyway. Battery life claims are universally exaggerated. This product was no exception. Over the past 12 months, that already-iffy battery life got even shorter. This past weekend the headphones died altogether. They won't charge and they won't turn on. It's not like I overused the headphones, either. Since my purchase 12 months ago I estimate I have used them fewer than 50 times. Compared to people who practically live with buds in their ears, that's nothing. I don't expect miracles, but I do expect more from a product like this. I won't purchase another product from this company any time soon. \n Rating: 2",

There was a small bit of confusion in the wiring diagrams supplied : the main manual indicates that Terminals 1 and 3 need to be connected by a jumper wire and also Terminals 2 and 5. However, in the small enclosed package that has the jumper wires is a sheet that shows Terminals 1 and 5 to be connected and also Terminals 2 and 3. The problem is the supplied jumper wires are too short and those latter connections are impossible to make. It's a little confusing that there are two different jumper connection shown in the paperwork with the product. I went with the one that the wires were long enough to actually work with. In practice I suspect it doesn't matter. Beyond that confusion, the rest of the install was straight forward. Programming is pretty easy, the display however is rather small and you have to look at it closely. Doubling the size of the LCD would be nice ! The buttons were not as smooth as they could be. Sometimes a light press resulted in nothing happening and it was necessary to press rather firmly to get the display to change as expected. But once the setup is done, these don't have to be touched again unless the program needs to be altered. It is very easy to bring the water heater on out of cycle by just pushing the large button that is accessible without opening the timer door. It then stays on until the next programmed off cycle or until a user pushes the button again. I'll have to gather a few months of data to see how much I save by using this timer \n Rating: 2",

Super glad I got the small because the medium would have been too big. I’m 5ft 3 and 125 lbs. I don’t know how long the dress will last as the zipper is a little fragil but other than that it’s awesome. When my boyfriend of 2 years came to the door to pick me up, his jaw kinda dropped to floor and he was speechless lol. Score! The dress is conservative yet super sexy in a classic way! Success for $25 bucks! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the sizing chart inaccuracies. \n Rating: 2",

My criteria was it had to have a trolley sleeve, be stylish and versatile enough to bring to the beach, roomy enough to fit my travel pillow, accessories, food and change of clothes, and zippered so my stuff doesn’t fall out. This met all the criteria and I also loved that it has a flat bottom and is easy to clean, because I will be stowing this under the seat in front of me and we all know how disgustingly dirty planes are. The trolley sleeve keeps the bag together with the main bag more securely, so I can’t wait to try this out. Some reviews have said it doesn’t fit over the handle, but this is not a problem with my Eagle Creek roller bag. The only thing I think I would change are the handles, because they are kind of thin and may hurt if carrying heavier stuff as a tote, but I can deal with it and my solution would be to slip on some padded sleeves on the handle. \n Rating: 1",

Acting on this information, I went ahead to repurchase a new item to \"replace\" the item since I will be receiving the refund of the value. A couple of days later, I receive a phone call from Asurion changing their statement to state that they would instead offer a gift card instead of refund to my account. When I tried to explain that this defeats the purpose of replacing the item since I would have no use of the gift card, the customer service rep on the phone went ahead to school me on the difference between insurance and protection plans all the while avoiding a key mistake that an employee of theirs made by providing a different information earlier.

Great purchase, as there were no reviews wanted to provide something for others. *** UPDATE 6 WEEKS later, product broke, band slipped out of watch connection.

I'm not a hardcore audiophile but most of the in ear headphones that I've used either have decent bass response but sound dull on the higher frequencies or have clear highs but wind up sounding tinny because of poor low end performance. Most headphones use either balanced armature or dynamic drivers each of which has its pros and cons. These incorporate both types of technology into their drivers . I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks. At $60 they aren't cheap but they sound a lot better than Beats that are twice as much money. I'm very happy with them and I think they are a relative bargain. \n Rating: 1",

The elastic tab now is replaced by a red canvas looking tab. When you pull it to lift the cards out of the wallet, it just hangs there until you push the cards back in with your hand.

I have other bulbs in similar conditions which have lasted many years. I am disappointed in the short life of these. I have adjusted my overall rating down because of this problem. Original Review: These does exactly what I want them to do: they turn off in daylight, and on in darkness. I was skeptical because when I opened the package and looked at the bulbs, I could not find a photo sensor … so I expected these to stay on all the time, contrary to the claim. But, even though I couldn't find the photo sensor, it must be there. These do indeed turn on at night and off in the morning. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were described as \"cool white\". I'd describe them as \"blue-white\". (I'll take some of the blame for this, though, because the description did say 6000K, and I didn't pay enough attention to that. I wish I'd gotten the 3000K version.) In the end, these do the job they say they'll do. \n Rating: 2",

What I Love about these: When you pull it out of the charging case, it automatically connects to my phone. When I stick it back into the charger, it disconnects. The fit. I didn't know if the upside down, fill your ear design would be comfortable, but it actually is. It makes these very stable and I can even run with them in without them moving at all. LIke, I said before, if these got a little louder, I could give them a 5 star. I didn't notice that these were noise cancelling. So can't comment on that. I only ever keep on in, so that's probably why I didn't notice. \n Rating: 2",

            "input": "Review: So after an issue with sneaky mice, ones that evaded the snap traps we had to resort to using sticky trap and have found success with them. Snap traps should be your first approach as they are fast and clean kill but when used correctly sticky traps can be valuable, especially in the case of young mice that won't set off snap traps due to how light they are. Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible! The horrible damage it does to wildlife is astronomical as it doesn't stop with the rodent but is passed on to every predator and scavenger in the ecosystem. \n Rating: 1",

It works for that purpose, but honestly I would not use it for much else. It's very slow, especially if you have more than one application open. The screen resolution hurt my eyes for the longest time, but I usually just write documents so it's not too bad for that purpose. The battery life is not long at all. The box says not to use while charging. I thought it was because of overheating, but it does not get hot at all. The tablet uses battery faster than it can charge, so that may be why. It takes at least 4 hours to fully charge. The thing that infuriates me the most, is the right shift key. It's different than the photos advertised, and is on the other side of the up arrow. I have small fingers so it's very hard to reach that key. On the plus side, it comes with a charger, but also can charge with a micro usb. It detaches easily from the keyboard, but stays on without problem if I need it to. Seems durable, but plastic screen has detached slightly already. Overall, next time I would definitely spend a little extra for a tablet I would actually enjoy. \n Rating: 2",

I've used mine for approximately 4-5 months, and we're not talking excessively or roughly here, just to vacuum a small room and occasionally an area rug. About six weeks ago, the handle/cannister part started separating from the base while using it normally. It would just pop off and there was no way to secure it. I just had to push them back together and wait for them to pop apart again. Again, I was NOT slamming the vacuum around, the simple action of moving the vacuum back and forth (you know, vacuuming) would cause it to separate. Then yesterday, one corner piece of the base with one of the wheels just fell off while using it. A close look at it showed that one of the cheap plastic locking pieces that kept it in place had moved out of alignment. It is made to do this (lock and unlock). I went to put the corner piece back on and lock it into place. I applied a minimal amount of pressure to relock it and the locking piece snapped. Super high quality stuff here. I tried using heavy duty tape to secure the pieces back together and that worked fine, but now the brush no longer spins. So that's the last straw. This is going in the garbage and I will not be purchasing a Shark product ever again. I would highly recommend you avoid this one. see less \n Rating: 2",

The chia seeds absorb the liquid and turn this into a thicker shake. I cannot have it any other way.

I and my 13 years old grand daughter were able to assemble it in about 3 hours.

I just purchased this and it already ripped after lifting the bag for the first time with my clothes in it. I read someone’s review about the same problem before purchasing and had my fingers crossed hoping it wouldn’t happen to me... but it did :/ On the bright side, however, I was able to fit an entire dresser full of clothes into this bag! I had to get rid of my dresser and make more space in my room ASAP and had to purchase something quickly. I only bought one at first because I wanted to make sure I liked the product and also to see how much I could actually fit before getting more. When I first received the bag, I did not like the quality. I wanted to return it but found out returns were not accepted for this item. So I had no choice but to give it a try, and to my surprise, was able to fit all the clothes from my large dresser. I definitely did not expect everything to fit! I thought I would have for sure needed at least two. Anyway, I was very happy with my purchase at that point and didn’t have any problems either, so I ended up purchasing another one even though the price had increased. That, of course, was a mistake as the plastic from second bag tore the moment I lifted it with my clothes to set it aside. I haven’t touched the first bag since I put my clothes in it but I’m pretty sure if I touch it again, it will rip. The bag definitely saves you a ton of space but I would suggest looking elsewhere for a similar product that is better quality. It is definitely worth it to spend a little extra for a stronger quality bag that will last longer. This particular item, on the other hand, is cheaply made and is not worth the price, unless the cost is less than $5. Yes, I was able to fit everything in the bag but what good does that do for me if the bag is ripped up? Keep in my mind the bag is lightweight only because it’s made from very cheap quality. I shouldn’t have purchased the second one but oh well... like I said, it’s okay for now until I find something better. \n Rating: 2",

Riley is supposed to be excellent as a profiler, but I didn't really view her insights as extraordinary. In fact, sometimes she's rather dim-witted, as evidenced by one of the later scenes in the book with the female patient. Most of the action seemed to be a frantic race from one place to another, where the minor characters ended up doing more of the rescuing or discoveries than the main characters. I didn't feel a lot of investment in the romance between Riley and Thayne either. Maybe it's because the reader doesn't get to see their attraction for each other from the beginning of their relationship. \n Rating: 3",

So I will preface that this computer was barely USED by me until 3 months ago, and I've had nothing but problems since. There was no physical damage as far as I could tell however I've been having problems since I've decided to use it regularly: The wifi is very unstable and sometimes nonexistent, since I had to move from my laptop to using this desktop, I've been attempting to play games with my friends, only to disconnect every 30 minutes. Now I originally thought the issue was my internet provider, but none of my other devices were having issues. I decided to investigate my router, no issues at all. I move to the pc and I noticed that the usb dongle they include that either assists (or allows not even certain at this point anymore) the wifi connectivity was no longer operating. I removed it, and plugged it into my old laptop, it functioned, I attempted to use it on a different port, nothing. I decided to swap the usb with one that I knew was working, and it didn't work, AND afterwards that port ceased to function until next restart. THIS WAS ONLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF ACTUAL USAGE. (Computer was left untouched for most of a year and picked up for primary usage in May). I've been having this problem quite consistently with the ports, and I recently attempted to contact skytech support, of which all of their lines were busy and they had me leave my name and phone number and they'd get back to me as soon as possible. I called at 11 am PST (of which they are open until 5pm PST) and I didn't receive a call since. Now while this problem is quite recent, I would like to point out that this PC is not HTC VIVE compatible due to the fact that there is a significant lack of ports that actually function, some of the ports are not connected to the card which means they will NOT function whatsoever, so if you are using this computer for VR, your only option really is to get a RIFT S for it. \n Rating: 2",

Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far. Buyers beware. At least for the pants... which is what you need most! if I wanted to only protect my top, I would have went with my poncho. \n Rating: 1",

It was good in the beginning when I started to chew, but the more I chewed and it dissolved I started to get a bad taste that continued on to become a bad aftertaste. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s not a bitter taste but it’s certainly not a pleasant taste. Another thing I didn’t like is that each chew has 4 grams of carbs. I need 1500 mg of calcium per day due to Bariatric surgery, so I would be consuming 12 grams of carbs per day. I’m trying to follow a Keto way of eating and would prefer it not to have so many carbs just for a supplement. It has corn syrup and sugar, and then they added Splenda. I guess the aftertaste would be worse if those ingredients weren’t there. I do applaud them for avoiding aspartame. I do like the fact that they used calcium citrate instead of carbonate. I also like the fact that one chew is 500 mg. It has some Vitamin K2 in it as well which is good. I’ll continue to take these until I find a reasonable replacement. I’ll just have to have something ready to eat immediately after these chews to hide the aftertaste. I’ve always had very sensitive taste buds. Probably nobody else can taste what I’m tasting in these. \n Rating: 3",

As soon as I received the product, I plugged in my Acer switch 5 on the usb-c port, and charged really fast. That was great... Right after that I added my Galaxy S8 on the quick charge port and it recognized as fast charging, that was great too! Third step was to add another phone on the USB-A smart port, which I did, and to my surprise the tablet stopped charging...I unplugged the usb-a the tablet started charging again...bottom line the USB-a ports can NOT be used with the usb-c charging port... Bottom line, if you want to buy this charger keep in mind you can only use 2 ports, or the 3 USB-A ports... Buying this for the usb-a ports is not worth the money, buying this for the usb-c and quick charge port, I guess its a good deal, hence the two stars... It also comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable which is great, others in this price and even higher, dont. That being said, you do NOT get what you pay for, as the 3 usb-a ports are unusable and nowhere in the description says this. Specifically it says this \" Use it to charge a USB-C and 4 USB-powered devices simultaneously at home or in the office.\". I was planning on giving 3 stars just because its worth the 2 ports and the price, but after seeing this on the description I will have to drop it on 2... \n Rating: 2",

I'll go back to my previous hand lotion, which never left them dry. I just tried this because it supposedly had healthier ingredients and didn't leave a greasy residue. \n Rating: 1",

Later, a phone apparently woke someone up, but then in the same paragraph the phone was dead. So I think it was supposed to say that maybe the phone dropped on the floor and woke the person up? But putting that aside, it was a very good original story. I like the main character and it was fast-moving and interesting. The only other thing that made me leave a star off, is that it was rather short and didn't really have an ending, you have to read the second book to find out what happens. I do recommend this, if you're willing to grab the second book too. \n Rating: 3",

Bike to bike is actually pretty loud I could hear my buddy fine even at 85 mph (he was hearing a bit of wind noise though). Music is a bit quieter followed by answering phone calls paired to a mobile phone being almost too quiet (before moving the speakers). Music quality is obviously not great but at this price point I was not expecting it would match any set of headphones. Battery life seems to be good as well went for 3 relatively long rides (music and intercom) and it didn't die. I am not aware of a way to check the state of charge. If you are looking for a good COMS system for the cheap at 40 bucks a unit these are a solid choice but if you want good music quality then consider other options. \n Rating: 2",

The video feed looks a little stretched on a Samsung Galaxy S7 but it connects without problems. Because of its light frame, it easily gets pushed around by the wind so I haven't flown it too high in the sky yet. Make sure to read the manual before first setup to learn best practices of drone handling and watch some YouTube tutorials!

I really love how everything fits into the backpack so it saves space but also so she can take it on the go. With 17 instruments I don't have to worry she will be bored after a few minutes. The pictures showed the tambourine had a giraffe, a monkey and a lion on it which I really liked but the one I received was actually a picture of a bee or maybe a butterfly so I was slightly disappointed by that. Overall it's a cute set but I do feel it is slightly on the expensive side for the quality and what you actually get. \n Rating: 2",

It's very confusing as I've ordered some of these Chinese made shirts before. Sizing is all over the map -- sometimes they follow the size chart and sometimes they are the actual letter size. Makes it very difficult to guess which one it might be. Wanted a few new tops for my niece and of the 6 Chinese-made tops I ordered, only one fit.

Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I’d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn’t like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start. Sigh... \n Rating: 1",

This did not fix the pressure problem, just the cleanliness problem. However, I started using a thumbtack to clean the drip point in the metal cup that holds the coffee. This aha moment did not come from customer care but has taken care of the problem. Originally I had this at 5 stars for making great cappuccinos. Went down to 1 star when it stopped working more than 50% of the time. Bringing it up to 3 stars as the machine seems good, but the experience with Customer Care and having to figure out how to get it working right was not awesome. Original review: Good: When it works it makes great espresso and cappuccinos. It is easy to clean, although the sealed metal filters that came with the machine would retain water. Bad: After a 9 months the pressure was insufficient to get the double shot to go thru. No change in coffee brand. Ugly: Spoke with their customer care several times, and it seemed more like they wanted to get me not to submit a claim against the warranty than to help. Just because it made 1 cup 1 time, does not mean it wasn't failing 95% of the times. I still don't know what's wrong with the machine, if it is fixable or not, but now its outside of warranty. Would not recommend. \n Rating: 3",

It'll knock loose easily and damage the disk so I suggest transferring the game disk onto a USB drive, or a larger disk, if you have the knowledge. And the battery does NOT last to 5 hours, even with a full charge! We've been getting maybe a little over an hour of play with it but so far it has not played a single full movie so I think we might have gotten a bad battery. The game controller works very well and is easy enough to use for a toddler so happy with that. The sound is great, as well as the video playback. Overall, it's okay but it definitely needs a slight upgrade to the mini disk slot and a second check on battery life before shipment. \n Rating: 3",

Did a 62 mile bicycle ride in rainy and windy conditions. These hold good on the eyes, no moisture accumulation and not once they fell off or were loose.

The overall look of it wasn't super eye catching but we are big golf fans here so the simple design and logo are still appealing to us. (wish it would be available in multiple colors, though) The lid was easy to take on and off. The part of the lid that you can open and close was great! It closed completely and securely which was much appreciated! No leaks! Most importantly, the tumbler kept my coffee hot for a much longer period of time than any mugs that I currently own. This will be great for the cold winter months! The size was just right and it fit in my vehicle's cup holder without any issues. I'm excited to try it for cold beverages, too, just to see if it can out perform the tumblers that I was previously using. My only real complaint is that it's not dishwasher safe. I know it's a higher quality tumbler and made of stainless steel but it can be a pain to have to hand wash at times; especially when I'm in a hurry! Overall, this is a great product, though, and one that I would definitely recommend! \n Rating: 2",

In fact, there is a moment when the heroine finally has enough and I thought: \"good, now she'll go find someone who turns her on\". Not the emotional reaction the author intended, I'm guessing... I was also annoyed by the fact that the Hero had a girlfriend he neglected for most of the book -- not a good omen. And there were a number of things that should have been addressed a bit more thoroughly: how the heroine was going to deal with Nick's mother, the grandmother's behavior towards the heroine, etc. Add to all that the fact that it went on and on with nothing happening and no real psychological step forward, and it was a bore of a book. There was no emotional payoff and basically will be forgotten by this evening. I can't recommend this one. \n Rating: 2",

But the dogs all looked at me, as though I was threatening to beat them. And our Black Lab... Which I honestly cannot remember when he's EVER turned down anything offered to him to eat. Perhaps they were starting to go rancid??? Though I couldn't smell anything. But I know with dry food, once it is exposed to oxygen, it starts going rancid within 2 weeks. Which is why I only keep out enough for a little over a week, then freeze the rest. I don't know if everyone else's came like mine. But the giant bag it all came in, was open, thus exposed to oxygen. Anyway, with none of the dogs wanting to eat it, I have no choice but to return. And since it's the 20lb box, inside of ANOTHER box... What a pain. lol \n Rating: 1",

The day these arrived, they were generally fine. The only issue I had was a slight discomfort under the right heel. It felt like an imperfection in the inner sole, but it was not enough to stop wearing them. By month 2, the discomfort under the right heel had manifested as a hole in the inner sole. By month 4, the outer sole had worn through on the same spot, and by month 5, I could easily stick two fingers through the right heel and had to stop wearing them. The shoes were otherwise generally very comfortable with the exception of THE GAPING HOLE under the right heel. I really liked the Velcro fastener and the roomy toe-box. I thought I had found a hidden gem of a product -- why would I continue to pay 3X the cost for Merrell Trail Gloves? Oh, now I see. It's because they last 6X as long. \n Rating: 2",

As I pulled it out of the box, one of the cushioning pieces fell off. While it was simple to just stick it back on, it falls off frequently. Not too big of a deal, but certainly annoying to have to constantly be aware of it and actively try not to lose it (it’s tiny). The bigger issue is that the blades aren’t nearly as sharp as they should be. Like I said, I only have 6 small bushes, so it’s not like I’m trying to saw off tree limbs — this should easily handle a job like mine, but sometimes it takes a lot more effort than it should to cut through. I’d recommend these only for your smallest trimming work. \n Rating: 3",

The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight. You HAVE TO PICK IT UP to reach the hard to get to, tiny power button in the rear next to the charging port. For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing. Definitely disappointing and would not recommend. \n Rating: 1",

The pillow itself is comfy, but it’s so massive it’s hard to maneuver and get it in a position that’s comfortable to sleep in. The one night I did sleep with the pillow, I woke up with my entire side numb from the weight of my arm and the pillow. Think I should’ve went with a smaller pillow just for my legs and not this huge pillow that wraps around my head and neck. I mainly use it now to prop myself up to watch TV and for quick naps...perhaps when I get further along I’ll have more use for it, but for now it’s just at the end of our bed like a pet. \n Rating: 2",

Therefore this book is not much useful. A good word problem book should lead kids to think about every question and find out the proper solution. There are patterns among word problems, but the book should not have made it so obvious that kids do not need to think at all. \n Rating: 2",

BAD because Close/Open indicators are hard to read (grayish silver against black). Also hard to see if it is open or close because the movable closing mechanism inside is same color as lid. If you don't have your glasses to read the hard-to-read indicators, you have to make sure to tip it a bit to check if it's closed.

The included black screws are actually some cheap, very soft metal (looks like white metal). This is extremely poor quality control, especial for an installation that requires a very high standard for securing the mounting. PYLE rates these speaker mounts up to 110 lbs (from PYLE's website) - I would think this would warrant quality assurances around the type of screw they are including in the installation kit. In the middle of the installation, I had stop, jump in my car and head to the nearest DIY store to hunt down black PAN head screws. Absolutely ridiculous. I would not recommend buying anything from a company with such low quality control standards. \n Rating: 2",

            "input": "Review: These cabinets come in a compact box with foam padding to prevent shipping damage. That's a nice feature. They come in a compact box because the cabinets are actually made up of three rectangular shaped units. That helps to make them fairly strong once they are put together with the back panels. I have been putting together press board furniture for 30+ years and have seen the parts quality and chip board quality decrease. This is about as low in quality as I have seen yet, but it still works to suit a purpose. There is a faint chemical smell from these. The best way I have to put these together is to put the top box together first on a carpeted floor, square up the box and attach the back panel, then attach the second box, square it up again and attache the back panel, etc. I used some glue I had around for strength. The dowel pins are small. I have never seen them that thin before, but again they do the job. I bought two and have only put together the first one so far. The only thing I will do differently with the second one is to use small finish nails instead of the easily bendable things they provide. They should have provided plastic covers for the cams, but once the cabinets are loaded they are not visible. There are small holes in the top panel to secure the cabinet to the wall. I would have preferred that they not leave holes in there. Once fully put together the cabinets look decent and are fairly sturdy. They are just the right size to have six rows of DVDs or Blu Rays. The main reason I got these is because they fit in very small spaces and I needed extra storage. If I was looking for something more permanent, I definitely would look at other products. As it is these should be viewed as cheap and disposable but good for the purpose they are made for. I had thought about using two cabinets and building them so they are five boxes high instead of three. May still try that, and if I do it would be necessary to anchor them to a wall. The back panels are not really configured to do that because their interlocking \"jigsaw\" pattern is specific to three boxes, but it may be worth a try to save floor space. A wall of these things could look pretty cool and would be functional. \n Rating: 2",

            "input": "Review: I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge. \n Rating: 1",

On 30th, I realized that the face of the tracker had some scratches and he didn't know how it happened. I emailed the seller to inform the issue. In fact, before buying this tracker, I read reviews and found out 1 case, it was scratched and seller exchanged new piece for the customer. The exchange piece was working well since then. That was why I decided to take it and thought defect was just odd. Waiting for them to solve my problem...Will update when I got their final solution \n Rating: 2",

I drink from it sideways so the lid isn't in my face lol. It doesn't drip or leak and the locking feature works great. I have been putting it in my briefcase with my laptop for the last month without incident. I also like the one-touch button to open the lid (when it's unlocked). It's a big bottle, so of course it's much heavier than a plastic bottle. A hidden benefit is the handle on the back: it allows you to lay the bottle on its side without rolling around. Since it's so tall, this has been great for keeping it on my bedside table. Don't have to worry about knocking over a huge glass bottle in the middle of the night. It's easy to clean, and I like that no plastic comes into contact with the water. I have loved my Takeya water bottle forever but finally needed a replacement and they don't make the same one anymore. This one is even better, I'm glad I got it. \n Rating: 1",

I find that they are among the best earplugs I have tried in terms of fidelity. They cut volume down to a comfortable level for extended exposure while still letting enough mid and high frequencies through that I can understand what I am hearing. They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops. They're also potentially easy to lose in your ear canal-- I find that the stems are a bit short, and I sometimes feel like I'm one misstep away from a very sticky situation. On the upside, this also means that they're Very Discrete! You will not look like a nerd as one does when they wear bright orange foam earplugs. \n Rating: 2",

First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the \"peep,\" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it. \n Rating: 1",

On average, each timer has worked well for slightly more than one year, and then the integrated backup rechargeable battery fails. The battery is supposed to retain the current date and time for about 24 hours when a power outage occurs. But, either the integrated battery or charging circuitry used by Leviton is deficient. Also, the rechargeable battery cannot be removed and replaced. After about one year the current date and time is lost whenever power flickers for just a moment. Leviton seems to acknowledge the problem indirectly as their customer service has never argued when I request a warranty replacement. But, I am getting tired of the annual replacement schedule. I've also read a number of complaints about this issue on Leviton's knowledge base web page. So, it's not just me, and Leviton doesn't appear to be taking any corrective action. \n Rating: 1",

This truck is fun for kids or adults and is surprisingly tough. The fun lasted for about a day. After a few charges it doesn’t seem to work. It will charge, show full charged and that is where the good news stops. The truck takes off full throttle without the controller being pressed in reverse and then when I press the throttle it stops. The manufacturer seemed willing to swap for a replacement but looking at the costs associated with having to ship it back to the manufacturer for repair/ replacement just wasn’t worth it as I was too busy to get to the PO. I didn’t find it fruitful to spend the cost of a new product to ship this back. At this point it is a paper weight in my garage. The electronics in this truck seem to be junk but on a positive it does look cool. Lesson learned, same money and buy better. Seems the build quality is either hit or miss based on the reviews. \n Rating: 2",

When in landscape mode to watch a video there the strap is again sticking out like a sore thumb. Who designed this thing. The on/off button is very hard to operate in this case. It takes multiple attempts to turn the phone off/on. Terrible design. In fact other than being a nice looking case this thing is subpar and poorly designed. I really don't understand all the good reviews here. Finally, these type case should be designed to have the phone in a magnetic removable case. Talking on the phone requires folding the case open on this thing and that would be eliminated with the removable case or at least give you the option if you wanted to. Once again the removable magnetic case kills it. That is extremely convienient and something that Dreem came up with and has since been copied by other companies. I definately would not recommend this case. I am waiting for Dreem to come out with the xs max version so I can dump this pig. \n Rating: 2",

I was looking for something specifically designed to hold multiple necklaces with thin chains that tangle easily, and something that could handle multiple pairs of dangly earrings. I don't have a ton of rings and heavy bracelets, so I didn't need that kind of storage. This one will work. I just wish could find one that is more artistic (perhaps featuring the art of famous artists, or rock 'n' roll, edgy themes, etc.) and made out of organic cotton/linen or hand-tooled leather (boho) for a decent price. These plastic quilted cases are not exactly my style, and the cloth jewelry rolls don't seem to have the structure or storage I need. Thoughts? Anyone? \n Rating: 2",

Last but not least, it's compact and thus easy to use in a utility sink or a bathtub. They even include a mesh screen that slips over one of the baskets and thus allows you to strain & retrieve all your stainless steel pins easily. Hornady really thought this through and built a quality product, so if you're wet tumbling, this is definitely the media separator to get. \n Rating: 1",

The most damning aspect of them is that when I have my phone in my pants pocket, they sound cuts off because the bluetooth can't penetrate the fabric of my shorts and reach the headphones. This doesn't necessarily happen when I am indoors and stationary, but when I'm walking down the street for my commute, it happens nearly every time. In that situation, I have to hold the phone in my hand at chest height for the headphones to work properly. The other gripe that I have is that the plastic piece that goes behind the neck is one piece and is too small for me. This causes the headphones to be pulled out at an angle when I wear them. I did report my issue of the connectivity to the seller, and they were very gracious in sending me another pair, but the second pair had the exact same issue.

I don't want my money back but it would be nice if I could get a pillow case. So from now on I guess I have to inspect the sheets before I wash them! \n Rating: 3",

HOWEVER, the common technique of inlay - filling the void with powder then dripping CA glue (thin super glue, 2-3 cP) over top of the powder does NOT work with this material. The CA beads up and rolls off to the side. I tried to use Super Thin which is intended for this purpose. Guess I'm on to epoxy instead. \n Rating: 3",

Yes, I left the hose spigot on, but we didn't even break 90 degrees a single day during the month that I had this hose. It burst and was useless in literally 32 days. Amazon, thankfully, accepted my exchange on this hose, even though it was outside of the return window. But now, I am about 15 days into my second hose, and I just can't take the kinks! Literally kinks just by pulling it out. I am returning this hose and buying a hose that is more than twice the price of this one - and 30' shorter! Hoping that 'more money' doesn't equal 'more problems' in this scenario. I, for one, am completely done buying these multi-ply hoses. I am going to invest more in heavy duty, all rubber hoses, and hope that they last longer than a month! Any hose brand that claims \"never kink\" - either in the product title or product description, is a liar - and most likely, their hose kinks worse than any hose you've ever owned! Who would have thought that I would start critiquing garden hoses! I guess they are right - your interests change greatly as you age. \n Rating: 2",

Even with the sticky back removed the pins making contact with the copper is very hit or miss. I found the only way I can get a solid connection is to remove the silicon top of the tape and placing it on the bottom of the tape and install the tape upside down in the clip. I found that this gave me a solid connection each time with out failure. This method certainly negates the waterproof aspect at the connector, but is works. \n Rating: 2",

That one was a 5th generation. I then bought two more of these fire tablets, but from a different retailer. Same fire 7, but I believe a newer generation than even the 5th that we had and in a few months those ports as well became loose. The only way to charge these tablets is to wrap the charging cord around the tablets tight so that the port and cable are being pulled up over the tablet and held in place.

Although I don't need to read it to know- it's THAT predictable. Like in your face obvious what is coming. And it's stupid.... kinda like the main heroine.) Did I mention that, although the h is supposed to be an intelligent Harvard grad who does well at her job, she reacts to everything like a twit and her internal dialogue is filled with thoughts that make her TSTL. And at the first sign of romance, she suddenly can't manage her work ethic anymore. But it wasn't allll bad. The plot and tempo of the books may have been crap, and I may have wanted to strangle the vapid and hypocritical main heroine.... but, The main Hero seemed well developed, and the smut scenes were hot. So I gave it two stars for good guy and bed scenes- which were nice, but not enough to make me read the final book in the series. \n Rating: 2",

The size is a little disappointing. It barely wraps around the edges of the screen, and cuts off the very edge of the display. Not the end of the world, as it's only about 5-10 pixels, but still noticeable. But the adhesive. I had it pop off of my phone twice within the first 20 minutes of use. That's not good. If I drop my phone, this thing is coming right off. I'm also noticing as I write this review that the edges of the screen protector are not even, or straight, and that it can easily be shifted around just by pushing on the edge of the glass with a credit card or fingernail. Overall, I'd get a single screen protector for the same price, or even a little more. Don't waste your money on this garbage. \n Rating: 2",

I did not know they could fall out, but apparently ours did and that's why the feeder wasn't working. The vet replaced the chip for free and now the feeder works perfectly. It took about a week to train the cat to use it, but she has no issues with it and the other cat is constantly disappointed that the lid is closed. One note, though. It says that you can program how long the lid stays open after the cat leaves. In fact, there is just a 3 position switch. This is good enough for us, but it doesn't work the way I thought it would after reading the literature. \n Rating: 1",

Graphics are okay, no better than par for the course at this point (Battlefield's are slightly better). Frequent display glitches where the top 25% of the screen would lag or break pretty consistently during cutscenes. Story is unimpressive and the overly aggressive CO gets old extremely quick. Gameplay was choppy at best, seems there's a cutscene or a change of perspective every time you start to build any momentum. The health pack system made the play very frustrating - most levels are played something like: pop two shots, find cover, use health pack, repeat. Simply not very satisfying completing the campaign. Multiplayer is as bad as others have described. If you have someone else living with you who does not appreciate you yelling at the screen constantly, for their sake, do not buy this game. Laggy, inconsistent, and frustrating. As I mentioned earlier, I bought the game to play multiplayer with friends. The party system is an absolute mess. It's nearly impossible to play with friends. First, you have to change default settings to join parties at all, and if you're lucky enough to successfully create or join a party, you're likely to end up in entirely different games. I'd estimate I've successfully played the same match as my friends no more than 20% of the time. Please save your money until these issues are fixed, I promise you it's not worth your time in the current state the game is in. \n Rating: 2",

If your glasses are wire-frames, this won't be an issue, but if they're a bit thicker, you'll need two hands to put them on or take them off. This is something I wish I'd realized, especially since they don't flip up. The photos showed them clipped onto plastic frames, so I guess I thought this wouldn't be an issue, but it basically means that if the weather's partly cloudy, I can't really wear them while driving unless I'm stopping a lot. Still though, the tint is nice, not too dark, and more toward yellow which handles bright sunlight without diminishing vision. If you have wire frames or super thin plastic frames, I highly recommend these, but if they're a little thicker, I'd suggest going with ones that flip. \n Rating: 3",

I replaced my modem and this turned into a nightmare for this damned speaker. I tried to add my M3 as a new speaker only for the app to say that line of speakers isn't supported. For the sake of the help for others, if you have a speaker set up and replace a router, here is the fix: Delete the app, do a hard reset of the speaker (nowhere in any documentation is this mentioned)- do this by pushing and holding the cog icon button by the power input on the back reinstall the start the speaker, reinstall the app and start from scratch. If you have a blip in power/internet this thing has to be hard reset, it isn't able to reconnect or attempt to reconnect, so it just makes an annoying chiming sound instead. Then you have to unplug it and replug it in. Somehow it cripples my Echo Dot. Whenever connected either directly with a 3.5mm jack or over the network, it disables the speaker no matter what I have the audio set to. This is advertised as an Alexa/Echo compatible speaker. It isn't . Lastly is that it has no battery. I know it didn't when I bought it, but because everything about this speaker sucks other than sound quality, I feel that this is a pretty shitty oversight. Seriously, if the sound quality were even slightly worse this thing would get a 1 star review. It is a shit network speaker. \n Rating: 2",

I am normally a XS, S in bathing suit bottoms and the small fits perfect.

Do no order this product you will not be happy. I was ready for install and now out of return window so I am not very happy. I hooked up with my local automotive wiring shop and he told me the problem. It seems on the wire ends you have to squeeze the tab on the wire end and force it out of the lock then the wire ends comes off easy. Its a shame, since I did ruin two switches and pulled the ends out of three others. I would now order this item again with the knowledge of how to use it.

I returned both cameras, there were too many problems to make it worth the price. \n Rating: 2",

Can't speak for the ladies, however. My wife is still giving it the stink eye so I'm not sure if she is using it in secret or not. I don't check or ask. We have the cold water model only but I find it refreshing as the bum is not as prone to shock as the rest of the body.

I'm 6'2\" which isn't too freakishly tall imo and squats are in the guide book! This is a dangerous design flaw. 0/10 recommend! It might still work for the other exercises that don't stretch the band as far, such as half rep bicep curls, but I wouldn't risk it unless you like getting shot in the face ;) I'm sending this piece of garbage back asap and getting one of those cheap ones without the handles or the hidden bullets. \n Rating: 2",

            "input": "Review: I was skeptical of this safe because of some bad reviews. However this is one of my favorite purchases. Everything works perfectly for several months thus far. The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access \"key slot\" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe. \n Rating: 1",

            "input": "Review: I previously reviewed the first book in the series, Witching on a Star. That wasn’t a success by any means – I rated it 2,5 stars, and while I had high hopes for a reverse harem set in a witching academy, my hopes fell flat and the book was a bit of a dissapointment. Still, I picked up book two, As You Witch, because I wanted to see if it would get any better. The series has a lot of potential, it just never executes it well, so I thought that maybe some of those kinks would’ve gotten fixed in book two. Alas, no such luck, and I even liked this one less than the first one. This book was filled with unnecessary drama from the start until the end. With a million possible options to pick villains when your book is set in a witching world, the author keeps on using the mean girl as a villain. It’s dull and predictable. The dialogue is so bad that I had to roll my eyes at every other sentence. Max is immature, childish, entitled, and the guys she’s supposedly in love with are so bland and boring even I wouldn’t be able to keep them apart. There is no conflict. There’s nothing really at stake. The relationships are too perfect – these four guys are instantly OK with all of them being with the heroine, and none of them is trying to win her for themselves. Of the four guys, only two have a hint of a personality, and the other two are basically just thrown in so this would be a reverse harem and not a love triangle. Either give them more personality or focus on the two that do have developed personalities and that a reader can root for. Look, I know I’m one of the few who isn’t fond of this series, and it has really high overall ratings on Goodreads and Amazon. So, don’t take my word for it, this is after all just my opinion. But as far as reverse harems go, I’ve seen a lot better than this one. \n Rating: 2",

            "input": "Review: [UPDATE March 6, 2019] I have to admit this is not what I had hoped for. The wifi repeaters that was sent to extend the signal of the cameras means that every camera has to be COMPLETELY uninstalled and taken down from the walls and roofs that they are mounted to, which means cutting the conduit tubing that is protecting the wires since they are outdoors. THEN bringing each camera inside to the nvr and programming each one once connected to the nvr. Then after all that HOPEFULLY it all WORKS! (<--probably won't) Then at that point we can go back and completely install each camera like we had originally mounted them. So that means all new screws, new tubing, more time and definitely MORE MONEY wasted!!! Had I known this I promise I never would have bought these. Another problem is that even with a couple of the units that are close enough to have a FULL signal record in odd increments! The playback of the video shows there's motion but then completely SKIPS and JUMPS through all that motion so you can never even see what actually triggered that motion to begin with. I have it setting to record all cameras 24/7 plus I have motion to record in the 'continue setting' but like I say they jump allover the place. HORRIBLE. I can only assume the people that state they love this system and that are \"Verified Purchases\" must have some tiny houses cause they don't have these issues. And must have extensive networking experience cause I still can't even get these to port-forward through my router correctly to view them from our mobile devices when we are not at home. ---------------------------------------- I purchased the 8 camera 1080p wireless system with 2TB drive already installed and at first had a few problems with these cameras maintaining connection. By contacting customer service we discovered the house and distance between the cameras and the NVR was simply too large and far between. Grace with their great customer service team advised that even a longer antenna would not suffice so instead she acquired approval to have them send a wifi repeater or extender system that will essentially make up for the distances. I hope once that is all set up, installed, and programmed that it should all be working great then. \n Rating: 2",

The Amazon bags were about the same price as these but I got 900 of them. Here you get 200 bags that are a couple of inches smaller.

Now, it will only epilate for a few minutes before I have to put it back on the charger. Unfortunately, you cannot use this epilator while it is plugged into the charger, so it is kind of frustrating that you can't just power through and get the epilating over with in one sitting. With that being said, it does a really good job of actually epilating. My leg hairs grow quickly, so I have to epilate once every 2 weeks. This has been an okay first epilator, but honestly if I could send this one back I would. I will probably buy one in the future that will work while it's plugged in so I don't have to wait in between charges to use it.

So just because of the principle of the whole thing we did return it for a refund, which we have been told we will receive in a few days. \n Rating: 2",

I could pull it down almost to my knees, so works well if you want more of a tunic or dress than a shirt in terms of coverage. I wore it one time with no problem, rinsed in cold water after my swim, and hung to dry. It definitely worked to protect from the sun.

I thought I would try this product to see if I got better results though, unfortunately it did not give me better results. It is tiny and great for travel but it does not work as well as my homemade one. Save your money and make your own!

Whether it’s on a shelf or at the table, it’s gonna turn some heads. Now, onto the unfortunate bad. The printing of these editions clearly has had some issues, as I found minor ink stains in the spine on ~5 pages throughout all 3 books (The one pictured is the largest stain I found). The DMG also had pages that got folded up during printing which made them look like... that. Nothing which can’t be solved with a bit of cutting, but it’s still good to be aware of. There was also minor cosmetic damage to the outside of the box, but I’m not so concerned about that. If you get this set, inspect every page thoroughly for damages, but what you’ll be left with is a very special set of books! \n Rating: 2",

There's not much space to move and get a grip so the screws ended up going in as much as they could but the two pieces are still relatively loose. There's a gap between the two pieces. I don't recommend this to anyone at all. Only reason I kept it is because I'm not going to be moving it a lot so as long as I don't move it, it'll be fine. I also didn't want to go through the return process and disassembling the rack then trying to make it all fit back in the box the way it came. \n Rating: 2",

I also have Doterra brand oils, which are often way more expensive than these, so I decided to give a different brand a try. These just aren't as good of quality, which should be expected from a cheaper brand of oils. They work great for aromatherapy. I wouldn't use them for topical use, but they all have a nice smell, so they will be mainly used in my diffuser which is what they said their product should be used for.

I feel like there should be some visual cue as to which side the mirror opens from, and closes from. When you're opening the mirror, it's a guessing game (is it the magnet holding it shut and I should pull harder, or am I pulling on the wrong side?), and when you're closing the wings, if you guess wrong you put strain on the hinges because they hit the frame. \n Rating: 2",

It smells wonderful with all the warm spices you expect. The bags are individually wrapped. The labels on the bags recommend a steeping time of 5 minutes. This made a smooth mug of tea. There was no bitterness. I added 1 teaspoon of unprocessed sugar. I tried it before adding milk. The taste of the tea was far less strong than the scent of the tea. Without milk, it made for a delicate and pleasant tea. I could have even let it steep another minute. For the tea to have a full-bodied flavor with milk in it, I had to leave the bag in as I drank it or steep 2 bags at once for 6 minutes. Of course, personal tastes determine how a person likes their tea, but this review may give you a general guideline. It tastes especially good with a couple of teaspoons of 'Hoosier Hill Farms' powdered coconut milk in it. It pairs beautifully with the warm spices. \n Rating: 2",

Needed new phones (Ours were quite old) so I looked for an affordable alternative. These looked like a good deal, so I went for it. A few things to keep in mind... 1) One of my phones was new. The other had a SIM card in it, all of the protective plastic removed, and was obviously used. No damage, but I paid for an advertised \"Brand New Phone\" and am not happy that this one is used. 2) All of the embedded MetroPCS apps are there, but if you are not on Metro none of them work. I have disabled all of the apps I could, but you can't shut them all down, and you may want to use some. I don't have find my phone, for example, and there is no \"voice mail\" icon to indicate when you have a voicemail and your only access to voicemail is to dial the \"1\" on the key pad. 3) The playback volume for media is not very loud- my wife uses hers to watch videos off her facebook feed, and you can barely hear them even with the volume all the way up. Overall, I like the phone. Had I known it would be used and would lack some of the features I wanted because although it is unlocked it is still a Metro phone, I would have made a different decision. You might decide differently, but at least you know more than \"ITs a great phone and works with AT&T\" which is all the information I had to work with. \n Rating: 3",

The front attachments that I repaired seem to be holding up well.

After years of driving I hit a parking bumper that pushed the bumper back and popped the epoxy. I attempted to use the existing metal mesh and this to fix it, However I slightly scrapped going through a dip in the road and the slight pressure caused this epoxy to release as well. Trust me, I used A LOT of this epoxy on that joint! The plunger being deceptive. You HAVE to push down on the DEAD CENTER of the plunger to get it to dispense evenly.

Rising up through the ranks, from actress to script reader to head of Paramount pictures, her career spans the time when Hollywood went from stodgy and insular to wild and brash and into corporate-run risk-averse number counters. Through her time in charge, she led projects near to her, stepped down on her own terms, and led a life of philanthropy. Definitely worth the read. \n Rating: 2",

We have repositioned the antenna several times with no change which is very frustrating.

ALSO, when we were running the supplied cable through the ceiling it pulled apart so we ended up using the existing cable we were using for my old bulky antenna which pulled in all the local channels.

When running on battery the speaker will not shut off by itself when not playing music.

What kind of certifiable lunatic would make the pot so it won’t fit if the lid is on? So when you are done brewing I guess you have to immediately discard the rinds or just let it drip everywhere. It would also be nice if I could fit my hand in the pot to clean it. I by no means have giant hands.

Specifically told them that I was sent the wrong product. Guess what....sent me the wrong product again. Same issue. So now I have 12 containers of English Toffee.....and still no French Vanilla. So, as far as my review of the product....it’s based on the English Toffee.... I mean I figured I might as well try it since I had so many and undoubtedly someone felt I really needed it instead of what I ordered. ;) It blended well and price was comparable to what I could find locally when I could find it in stock. Flavor was ok but that may be a little biased because I really wanted French Vanilla and don’t prefer English Toffee. \n Rating: 2",

While the image holds it's definition on larger screens, there just doesn't seem to be any \"remarkable\" increase in sharpness or visual quality over the DVD. I found no issues with the audio presentation. Everything sounded perfectly clear. This season definitely sets itself apart in terms of style. Rich and vibrant colors are plentiful, and there is no shortage of music. Characters are well fleshed out and I found the writing to be adequate. Wes Bentley handles a leading role as best he can, but Evan Peters portrayal of the psychotic Mr. March was worth the price of admission alone. Series regular Jessica Lange did not return for this season, but her absence is barely noticeable. All in all, it's an interesting season. It's extreme in all the ways that a story about a hotel full of psychopaths, vampires and murderous spirits could be. While the presentation is not as vivid as I'd hoped to see on Blu-ray, the extra physical durability and slight visual uptick in picture quality delivered by the format still make this a solid choice over the DVD. \n Rating: 3",

Also if your not extremely careful in how you place the diaper the band will cut your child's leg/hip area. Very displeased in these would not recommend buying these. I'm thinking maybe some of these are not really Huggies thrown in with real ones because of the reviews and my own experience. It seems like maybe one in 20 or so is a knock off and if you get them it's horrible I don't plan to risk it again. Furthermore for my son to break out in such a way it worries me of what these diapers contain I hope they don't have some harmful chemical on them.

I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine. I would spend way too much money on something that smells good and lasts. That brand promise is exciting. I do not know if this is how it is supposed to be or if in fact this is not the real product.

I tried several fingers NOT loaded into the database and none could open it. Adding additional fingerprint access is easy. It was easy to attach to floor or wall and the hardware was included. I REALLY wish the power unit was behind the door/behind the fingerprint scanner (would be a 5-star review). You can't see this in the photos, however, or I might have kept shopping. The battery power supply is separate and uses a single plug into the bottom of the scanner. I leave mine plugged in, but it has come loose and fallen a few times. When I plug it back in there are two very loud \"BEEP\" sounds that I cannot eliminate or silence, which is a problem early in the AM when I'm the only one up. \n Rating: 2",

            "input": "Review: I very rarely leave a review - but this product is so stellar I felt compelled. I have fine, thin hair. Almost every other type of roller damages my hair causing it to break off. These rollers have a plastic core that makes them more rigid than any other foam roller - so they make the rolling up part much easier as they hold their shape and don't compress. I do not use the black self lock bar because it puts a \"dent\" in my hair. I use the thin clips/pins from my old hot rollers. They slide easily over the roller and hold it in place. If I need more clips I order these: Pro Touch Assorted Hot Roller Clips, 12 Count. I half way dry my hair and then use the rollers. If it gets too dry I spritz with water. Then I use the blow dryer to dry each roller. I put on my makeup, get dressed and then they are dry and I take them out and have firm, long lasting curls. BTW, i do use gel on my wet hair. I often sleep on my hair (no rollers) and it still looks good the 2nd day! I have short - medium length hair. \n Rating: 1",

What timing! Guess what I did for Christmas? Not surprised this TV is discontinued. It's a glorified paperweight. Element should stick with making cardboard boxes. I never write reviews but this was a special case. I would avoid buying any Televisions through Amazon. Period. Avoid the hassle and get a name brand TV like a Sony or Samsung. The few extra bucks is worth the peace of mind. Today as I write this, UPS just tried to deliver the same TV I sent out to return for a refund. Didn't bother ringing the door bell with the return label on Tuesday. Welcome to the Holiday Season. Incompetence with both Amazon and UPS. Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony.

It really looks like the director went with the whole \"Army of the 12 Monkeys\" thing right up until the end, until he couldn't figure out how to tie it all together, so he just changed the whole ending into something very boring and drab, like a joke with no punchline. \n Rating: 2",

I bought these to compare and had them shipped from the UK, but on the first bite it was immediately apparent that these lose the contest. The wafers have almost no flavor, and the cream in the middle is on the dry side and also less flavorful than it ought to be. Golden Oreos beat these hands down. If you're looking for proper British custard creams, get the Crawford brand. \n Rating: 3",

The receiver is tucked under the rear of the coach and in order to use this carrier the pedals and handlebars need to be removed. I gave 3 stars because while the rack is well designed and well made, nowhere does it say it won't extend far enough. I read a lot of reviews here before I bought it, and came back and read more trying to figure out what my next move would be. One reviewer mentioned an extension, and I found one here at Amazon designed just for this purpose -- to use a bike rack. It's annoying a product made for an RV doesn't not state it is designed to work on only a trailer or class C camper. Another issue is we will not be able to use either our furnace or generator while it's inserted in the receiver. In my photo you can see the receiver under the body of the coach. The two vents in the center are for the gas furnace and the tiny pipe in the lower left of the picture is the generator exhaust pipe. While the furnace is not an issue, in California's 100°+ Central Valley, we frequently run our generator while traveling to power our air conditioning. I'm not certain it's possible with bikes a mere inches from the exhaust. \n Rating: 3",

There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either.

The one I got at Target is thick silicone and my 9 month old son isn’t able to lift it off the table. This one is flimsy, has a white film that I can’t wash off, doesn’t feel like silicone, and my son easily ripped it off of our table. I’m not sure why this one is so different, but I really don’t recommend it. \n Rating: 1",
