            "input": "Question: If I were to try to achieve something you could say I 'had a go'. If I tried it multiple times, how would I write that down? I had many goes or I had many go's or I had many gos \nAnswer: The dictionaries I've checked seem to be unanimous that the plural of the noun 'go' is 'goes'. I didn't see one list its plural as 'gos'. However, I didn't check all dictionaries. American Heritage Dictionary: n. pl. goes Collins Dictionary: n, pl goes Merriam-Webster Dictionary: plural goes Cambridge Dictionary: plural goes Random House Unabridged Dictionary (dictionary.com): plural goes Google NGram Viewer does not show any results for 'two gos at' or 'two gos at', but does when written as 'goes'. A Google search shows the following results: 'two gos at' = 453 results. 'two goes at' = 19,500 results. 'three gos at' = 252 results. 'three goes at' = 20,200 results. Note that both Google search and Ngram Viewer may show false positives, as Google search, as far as I know, doesn't take punctuation into account when giving search results, ie., full stops, commas. But I think it's safe to assume the consensus is that the plural of go (attempt or try) is 'goes'. I think this is a good question, as somewhere in my head I have an instinct to write it 'gos'. However the answer is gotten easily by checking some dictionaries. Also, if you wrote 'I had three gos at it before giving up', I have a feeling the typical reader probably wouldn't even be surprised by it or notice it particularly as wrong. This is just my opinion. I have this feeling because the '-os'/'-oes' plural ending rules are wildly inconsistent. Potatoes, tomatoes and heroes are correct. But 'photos' and 'burritos' are correct. However most dictionaries seem to list either '-os' or '-oes' ending as acceptable in 'ghetto' and 'mosquito'. Both 'mosquito' and 'burrito' most likely come from Spanish, yet most dictionaries say only 'mosquito' can have plural ending either '-os' or 'oes', whereas they're consistent in listing '-os' for burrito plural. Same goes for 'canto', 'manifesto' and 'grotto'. These words most likely come from Italian, yet the plural of 'canto' is 'cantos', whereas the dictionaries say the plural of 'grotto' or 'manifesto' can end in either '-os' or '-oes'. Addendum As some people have claimed that the rules for -os or -oes plural endings are quite consistent (and I happen to disagree), I've included more examples to show just how unpredictable this can get. The claim generally is basically that borrowed words or imported words from other languages have -os as their endings and most everything else has -oes. The more specific claim is this rule applies for words from Romance languages specifically. embargo (Spanish): Dictionaries show only -oes plural. NGrams show -oes much more common. tornado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes much more common. desperado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes more common. cargo (Spanish) plural possibly as the pants: Dictionaries show either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes more common. mango (Portuguese): Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. domino (uncertain exactly which language, but a Romance one, or maybe directly from Latin): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. volcano (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. motto (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes to be more common. Words taken directly from Latin many times have -oes plural ending, but not always: veto has plural vetoes torpedo has plural torpedoes However memento overwhelmingly has plural mementos. And embryo is always embryos. Echo, directly from Greek, has plural 'echoes'. hello (native English): Nearly always 'hellos'. no (native English): Much more common as 'nos', ie., 'yeses and nos'. do (native English): Dictionaries give plural as either 'dos' or 'do's'. The results for searches of these terms would be confounding to say the least. weirdo (native English): some dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os is much more popular Unknown origin: hobo: Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams show roughly same frequency. gizmo: = Dictionaries only give -os, 'gizmoes' doesn't show anything in NGrams. gazebo: Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os more common.

Both words derive from Latin ego ('I'), the first-person singular pronoun. Egotism, the more commonly used term , denotes an excessive sense of self-importance, too-frequent use of the word 'I,' and general arrogance and boastfulness. Egoism, a more subtle term , is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct.

            "input": "Question: Is there a word that describes or denotes a type of conversation in which two speakers speak two different languages. In our country, Pakistan, there are approximately 75 languages, from which Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi are common, excluding English. So today I found two women speaking two different languages. For example: Speaker 1 has Urdu as their mother tongue. Speaker 2 has Sindhi as their mother tongue. Speaker 1 and 2 spoke their own mother tongue, which are different (Urdu and Sindhi) but both can understand each other's language. I thought that this is known as \"intermingling conversation,\" or a \"code switching.\" In my opinion, we can't use such words because code-switching refers \"shifting completely to the other language for a word, a phrase or sentence, and then revert back to the base language.\" Example sentences: They were in a bus and had [adjective] conversation. They were in a bus and had [noun or noun-phrase for such conversation]. I agree that the question (which is suspected as a duplicate one to this question) is really a duplicate, but its single answer still doesn't satisfy all. In that question, the phrase \"bilingual dialogue\" was suggested, which I (and others may) think that this refers to the code switching as well, which I don't want here. Some words confuse the readers which sense do they mean. I would also love to quote the comment of @Lambie regarding the term \"bilingual\" over here: \"Bilingual refers to one person. Not two people each of whom has a passive knowledge of the other's language but do not speak it well enough to use it actively.\" \nAnswer: I am a translator and interpreter and speak four languages (I am quadri-lingual, in fact). There is no specific term for this. And it's certainly not bilingual. If this refers to two people, it just means they at least passively know each other languages but actively only use their own. They each have a passive knowledge of the other's language, otherwise they'd be speaking one or the other. They are passive \"speakers\" of a language. passive speaker Passive knowledge means you can understand a language or read a language but cannot actively speak it with any confidence. For example, in my case, I speak three Romance languages but do not actively speak Italian. However, my passive knowledge of Italian is very good so I can actually carry on a conversation with an Italian speaker if they can understand English. (In fact, I can carry on a simple conversation but can understand an advanced one passively.) But beware: In the world of translation and interpretation, a passive language has a more technical meaning: it means the language from which a translator or interpreter is working. This is often symbolized as: German>English, English>Chinese. If a person is bilingual (which is not as frequent as one might imagine), this is signified like this: English<>Chinese. Here is a blog post about this issue as regards active and passive vocabulary in language learning, though it applies to monolinguals as well. passive and active vocabulary I often speak English to my husband and he responds in Spanish. We have a conversation in two languages. Bilingual means an individual can speak two languages equally well, though there are different levels of bilingualism. And, if I hear someone say: \"We had a bilingual conversation.\" I would understand that each of the speakers spoke two languages and both switched back and forth between those two languages without causing a break in their conversation due to lack of understanding. As for codes, mixing and switching them is not \"inter-lingual\". A speaker code switches within her or his own language. Reading over the answers, I had to laugh when thinking about having a conversation with someone where one person uses a different language than the other and they understand each other. Of course, they understand each other, otherwise it would not be a conversation, would it? And, I daresay that mutual intelligibility is an issue that does not involve more than one language necessarily. Who hasn't had a conversation with eggheads in a monolingual situation where there was no \"mutual intelligibility\" at all? And for the record, the idea that a Spanish speaker can understand a Portuguese speaker is a very specious idea. The fact much in the two languages is very similar does not account for the parts that are completely different. And this can lead to major misunderstandings and comical situations. (I just can't think of an example at the moment, as I write.) The mutual intelligibility factor is true only to a limited extent.",

Does a word that sounds like \"metal\" exist when describing an individual's character?

It is commonly seen in the phrase: (put someone) on their mettle meaning, (of a demanding situation) test someone's ability to face difficulties. 'there were regular public meetings where local MPs were put on their mettle and remorselessly pilloried' Source: ODO Other constructions are possible too, for example: test their mettle, apparently an American version (thanks, @PeterCordes) show your mettle, etc. Origins According to Merriam-Webster, mettle was, as @Sparhawk points out in the comments, originally simply a variant spelling of the word metal (which dates to at least the 13th century), and it was used in all of the same senses as its metallic relative. Over time, however, mettle came to be used mainly in figurative senses referring to the quality of someone's character, with a first known usage in 1581.

Prostitute is the most technical term. Hooker seems most commonly used in the United States, while in Britain this term is reserved for a position in rugby. Whore sounds much more violent to me. If one were seeking a woman to pay to sleep with him, he probably wouldn't say \"I'm looking for a whore tonight,\" but use hooker or prostitute. Calling someone a whore can be used to insult them, implying they sleep with many people (though for men the term would be man-whore). E.g., \"She is such a whore.\" Going back to a previous example, \"I'm looking for a whore tonight\" implies more to me that he is looking for someone who is easy to sleep with, not for a prostitute. Not to say you can't use the others in an insult. From \"Baby Got Back,\" by Sir Mix-A-Lot, we also have the opening dialogue: They only talk to her, because, she looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? But in this case the lady quoted is just saying that she looks like a prostitute, not that she is one, necessarily.

Why is it called \"shotgun\" instead of just a \"gun\" or a more technical term (9-gauge, barrel gun etc.)? \nAnswer: There are other things that shoot 'shot'. Cannons fired grapeshot as an effective way to deal with infantry. This makes a 'shotgun' just a gun that shoots shot instead of a cannon that does so. This clever naming scheme is also visible for 'rifles' which are simply guns with barrels that have been rifled.",

I'm curious though, is there any sentence that can be constructed where replacing \"your\" with \"you're\" keeps the sentence grammatically correct, but changes the meaning? If this is not possible, what grammar rules are in place that prevents these edge cases from occurring? \nAnswer: a. I love you and your bananas. b. I love you and you're bananas. This particular case depends on the your/you're coming after an independent clause followed by \"and,\" since its feasibility depends on functioning either as a second direct object or as another independent clause. It also depends on the noun serving either as a thing that someone might be in possession of (the bananas we eat) or as an adjective or noun complement describing a person (bananas=crazy). Easiest if that noun is plural or uncountable. The same sentence could be constructed with nuts, garbage, and other nouns which I'll let you brainstorm because my stormer hurts. You can also (and thanks to @Barmar for drawing attention to this) use verbs, in which case they act as a gerund with the possessive pronoun and a present participle with the \"you're.\" As in: a.

I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? \nAnswer: It's a perfect example of a false cognate pair that is created by a sort of linguistic homogenization. When we come across foreign words, we pronounce them with our own sounds, mapping a foreign sound to one natural to our own ear that seems close enough for our purposes. Unrelated sounds and syllables from unrelated languages might in this way each get mapped to a single native sound/syllable. In this way, we come to hear the sounds and syllables as related when they are not. Mesoamerican languages, for instance, did not have a \"v\" sound. Consequently, when learning Spanish, the natives of Central America had a devil of time with the fairly common v sound and ended up usually pronouncing it as a b. The b sound is related to the v sound, so it wasn't a subtle shift. In consequence, very often to this day words like \"votar\" (to vote) get pronounced identically with words like \"botar\" (to throw out) giving rise to numerous puns. When native Spanish speakers from Latin America learn English, they are often heard saying things like \"Thank you bery much,\" as a result. But \"bery,\" and its false homophones \"berry\" and \"bury\" have no shared ancestry. As a last point of interest, consider English spelling. It is so difficult precisely because speakers of English and the academic sources that safeguard the English language (Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, etc.) have made a general decision to preserve as best as possible the original spelling of the words in their original languages, making only occasional modifications to bring them into some kind of conventional conformity. So the Greek suffix - is conventionally transliterated as -pher, whereas the ending of Gwenhwyfar gets transliterated as -fer and the ending of aquifer stays as the Romans wrote it: -fer. This makes our spelling a bear to get a handle of, but it also locks the secret of most words' origins right into the words themselves. That means, once one has understood a bit of Latin, Greek, some common Celtic endings and a bit of German, one can almost always discern the origins of the word just by looking at it. Of course, it also means that we have to spend years and years memorizing spelling word lists and still relying on spellchecker far more than we care to admit.",

From the various definitions that I've looked at for ethereal, it says delicate, beautiful, heavenly, etc. but not necessarily quickly vanishing, except for the secondary definitions related to ether that suggests it evaporates. I'm just wondering if there is a better word than this. I'm using the term \"ethereal skill\" to describe a certain type of pilot skill (instrument flying) that requires tremendous practice to achieve proficiency, and once proficiency is achieved it is a beautiful thing, but if you don't practice it regularly, that skill vanishes after a few weeks.

Apparently, the word dates back to the early 16th century, so it shouldn't be considered slang (although, it is misused as slang for other reasons), but regardless of its vulgarity, could I use it in a formal context with its original definition? I imagine that people will be surprised, but when realizing in what context I am using it in, then it will be more understandable and acceptable to use it. Firstly, I do not even know the definition of the word due to its vastness in meaning, I always thought it was an exclamation-like word meaning nothing (for it to mean sexual activities is a slang definition, is that not correct?), but used purely for emphasis. What does it first and foremost mean in its original/accurate and/or formal definition? I also know of another definition of the word \"Fuck,\" which is \"I will fuck you\" as in \"I will defeat you\" (in context of fighting or combat), is that a formal definition as well? I mainly ask for this, because I need to use the word in this context, specifically and especially. Also, side question, is it possible not to always make it a vulgar word? Thanks in advance. \nAnswer: It is very unwise to use \"fuck\" in any formal context whatsover (outside of technical discussion of language). The word either has strong and forceful sexual meaning, or it has the debased banality of over-frequent use by those groups of society who lack nuances and who express themselves repetitively and coarsely. In neither case does the usage fit with formal discourse. In short, although an excellent word to describe a very pleasant and necessary activity, it is rude.",

In sum, is there a good way to promote good grammar, or at least protect it from the most egregious violations? \nAnswer: There is nothing wrong with having gut reactions to the way that people say things. I am completely aware that the standard/educated version of a language is arbitrary (i.e. is no more \"correct\" in any real sense than any dialect), and even still, I have pet peeves and things that irk me about people's language usage. I think these are unavoidable, just like my reaction to certain fashion choices that people make in their outfits. But, like with fashion, there is very little objective truth to my judgment about any of it. I try not to actually challenge people on uses that bother me; aside from the arbitrariness of language, every bit of evidence suggests that stopping language change in any significant way is like going to the beach and trying to stop the tide from coming in. There was a more in-depth discussion about this in a previous question. That said, I do believe there is a certain time and place where standards and clarity are important. In formal contexts, information is often supposed to be presented in a certain way, and, generally, these conventions benefit everyone.

However, there is a less common usage where \"a food\" means \"a type of food\": \"Cheese is a food made from milk\" ... and in this form, you can pluralise it ... \"Italy is the source of many delicious foods -- pizza, pasta, salami, biscotti...\" For comparison, think of \"a people\" - Are there meta-plurals beyond \"peoples\"?.",

Tonight I watched a movie (The Gospel of John) in which Jesus said (as quoted from the written Gospel of John), \"It is I.\" How does this expression differ from \"It is me?\" \nAnswer: \"It is me\" is ungrammatical. Transitive verbs, like speak take a subject and an object. Thus, You (subject) will speak to me. (object) The verb to be is not transitive, but copular. It takes a subject and predicate. Thus, It (subject) is I. (predicate) Also, it must be We'll soon find out who (subject) is who (predicate.) rather than We'll soon find out who (subject) is whom (object.)

            "input": "Question: This question, \"Discrete Units of a Continuous Quantity\", asks whether units of a continuous quantity should be spoken of as discrete or continuous. The top answer states The rule is simple, and you obviously know it: discrete quantities require the use of \"fewer\" and continuous quantities require the use of \"less\". Calorie, as a unit, requires the use of \"fewer\". Energy, as a continuum, requires the use of \"less\". \"Fewer calories means less energy.\" I do not understand the logic here though. Calorie is a unit, yes, but it is a continuous unit (it is possible to have half a calorie, or 4.582394 calories). Since a calorie is such a small unit of energy compared to what it is usually used for (food energy and human metabolism), it is very seldom expressed in a fractional form and instead is rounded (usually to the nearest 10 or higher). Why then should \"fewer\" be used with calorie instead of \"less\"? Is there another relevant rule than just \"continuous quantities use \"less\" and discrete quantities use \"fewer\"? \nAnswer: Divisibility does not mean something is not countable or that it isn't a discrete unit, requiring use of 'fewer'. A calorie is not 'energy' it is a 'unit of energy', and therefore, countable and discrete, even though it's divisible. It's divisible into further discrete units - half a calorie, in this case, is still a discrete unit. Using another example, you would have 'fewer' jars of peanut butter, even though someone might have eaten half of the peanut butter in some of the jars. You could even cut the entire jar in half, none of that matters, you still have fewer jars. And you also have less peanut butter, in the same way that fewer calories means less energy. The calorie corresponds to the jar, not to the peanut butter (that would correspond to the energy the calorie measures). It doesn't matter that there is 'less' peanut butter in some jars than in others any more than it would matter if some of the jars were a gallon in size, and some were just single-use jars with two tablespoons of peanut butter inside. Put another way, your 'half a calorie' is still a unit, and thus, you'd still say 'fewer calories'.",

If Joan is the person who answered the phone, should she say \"This is her\" or \"This is she\"? \nAnswer: It's correct either way. English has lost its case system almost completely. This makes it hard even for native speakers to decide between subject case (nominative) and object case (formerly accusative/dative). A long time ago far too long ago to be directly relevant today , English still had a 'proper' case system and the copula be was followed by subject case. This is normal for Indo-European languages. Therefore, originally it would have been something like (translating to modern) \"It is she\". However, just like French but under the radar, English developed emphatic forms of its pronouns. When an adult asks a bunch of children \"Qui veut de la glace ?\" / \"Who wants some ice cream?\", the children's natural response is \"Moi ! Moi ! Moi !\" / \"Me! Me! Me!\", not \"Je ! Je ! Je !\" / \"I! I! I!\" This doesn't mean that the response is in dative / object case but that the response is emphatic. The same emphatic form of the personal pronoun is also used in connection with the copula etre / be: \"C'est moi.\" / \"This is me.\" The French third person feminine pronoun happens to have no special emphatic form. It's elle whether emphatic or not. In English, the non-emphatic subject case is she, and all other forms (object case and emphatic form) are her. Therefore, in natural English the correct answer is \"This is her.\" This is how non-native speakers learn to say the sentence. For some reason, there is a tradition in English grammar (as taught to native speakers) to completely ignore the issue of emphatic pronouns and to assume that English has to work like German, which does not have them, or like Latin, where only emphatic pronouns exist and these carry the case distinctions. A non-native speaker who missed the drills for the emphatic pronouns but who, coming from another Indo-European language, knows about subject case after be, will quite logically say \"This is she.\" English prescriptivism, in its trademark cluelessness (often pointed out by proper linguists), stepped into the same trap. English has a tradition of rules being made up by ignorant prescriptivists and then taught to generations of students and used as shibboleths that serve to distinguish those who received a 'proper' education from those who just use the language naturally and correctly, such as intelligent members of the working class and of course the likes of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. As a result, \"This is she\" became a correct alternative again, long after it had fallen out of use. (Note on case terminology: English still has subject case and object case, though it only marks them on pronouns. It also has genitive pronouns, but since the former genitive suffix 's is now a possession-marking clitic, the status of genitive as a case in English is even less clear. English subject case is exactly the same thing that is called nominative in German, Latin etc. English object case is the result of a merger of accusative and dative, also known as accudative. This merger has long been completed in English, has almost completed in Dutch and many German dialects, but is still in progress in standard German.).",

Isn't it \"produce an uniform magnetic field\", or is the existing \"produce a uniform magnetic field pattern\" correct? \nAnswer: The word uniform begins with a palatal approximant /j/. The palatal approximant is a consonantal sound, even though the letter itself is a vowel. Since we use the pronunciation of the word following the article to determine whether we use \"a\" or \"an\", and because it is pronounced starting with a consonant, we use \"a\". Thus, the original sentence is correct. Just for the sake of completeness, the letter \"u\" can also have a vowel sound, such as in the word \"umbrella\", which begins with an open-mid back unrounded vowel //.",

They could be considered alternate pronunciations of the same word, similar to among/amongst or further/farther. 'While' came first, and then 'whilst' was derived from it. But they are not used with the same frequency and they give different 'feels'. 'While' is much more common (from Google nGrams) 'Whilst' sounds archaic, affected, or hyperacademic (which means no one in academia uses it). To Americans, 'whilst' sounds British, but at least in print, there is very little difference in the frequencies of the two words between AmE and BrE (via Google nGrams) In the end, it is correct grammar to use them interchangeably, but it is bad style...uh sorry, not the current fashion to use 'whilst'. No one (at least not in formal writing, like for newspapers or academic writing) uses 'whilst' anymore. It may be common and accepted in certain varieties of English (say Indian English) but is very jarring in standard English. However, in the 18th century the two were on more equal terms.

The expression makes sense -- a gorilla of that size would certainly be intimidating -- but what's so special about the number 800? Searching \"n lb gorilla\" on Google for various values of n results in many more hits when n = 800 than when n is any other quantity. Also, the Google Ngram Viewer finds notable occurrences of the phrase \"800 pound gorilla\" in texts starting around the late 1970s; other sized gorillas don't seem to be mentioned at all. The Wikipedia entry for the idiom claims that the phrase is rooted in a riddle (\"Where does an 800lb gorilla sleep?\"), but that's just passing the buck. A 700lb or 900lb gorilla would be equally entitled to sleep wherever he wants to. Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry for gorilla states that the average male gorilla weighs about 400lb, occasionally reaching 500lb in the wild. Only obese gorillas in captivity have attained weights of 600lb. So the number doesn't even seem to be related to gorilla biology (except that it is safely larger than any known gorilla, save King Kong). Given that it's an arbitrary figure, is there any reason the number 800 would be more popular than any other? More generally, is there any relevant research into why some numbers would be more popular or pleasing than other in contexts like this? \nAnswer: Quite large gorillas in the wild are at most 550 pounds; so an 800 pound gorilla is one that's oversized, even fat. As Wikipedia states, this phrase first originated with a riddle, \"Where does an 800 pound gorilla sleep?\" Ans: \"Anywhere it wants.\" Because this is the standard idiom, when people want to speak hyperbolically they will sometimes exaggerate the number to \"1,000 pound gorilla\", or some other, even larger number. In short: no, the number 800 does not have any special significance, except perhaps with reference to the typical (male) gorilla's average weight (450 pounds).",

Quick advice please. \nAnswer: Dan Bron's comment (above) that e-mail/email at its inception was treated as a mass noun is correctand so is Kristina Lopez's comment (above) that e-mail/email is widely applied today not just to the medium of electronic mail but to individual messages sent and received in that medium. For many years the technology magazines where I worked enforced a strict house rule: e-mail (and later email) referred to \"electronic mail\" as a mode of communication, and individual messages had to be termed \"e-mail [or email] messages.\" But three or four years ago, the overwhelming weight of popular usage prevailed, and we began to accept the use of email as a singular noun that could take an indefinite article, and emails as a plural nounboth referring to individual messages. It is probably not coincidental that other forms of electronic communication receive similar treatment in popular (and some publishing) usage: a text and texts for \"a text message\" and \"text messages,\" respectively; and an IM and IMs for \"an instant messaging message\" and \"instant messaging messages\" (as I recall, people used to avoid \"instant messaging message\" by conflating the technology with the individual message to produce \"instant message\"). At publishing houses, the proper handling of \"an e-mail [or email]\" versus \"an e-mail [or email] message\" remains a house style issuethere is no universally agreed-upon preference. If you are beholden to no one's style guide, you are free to use the wording that you like better.

My question is what impact did the association of this 7-like-glyph have on the eventual placement of keyboards placing the & on Shift+7 combination? The Wikipedia article on the QUERTY keyboard shows that the ampersand was a separate key in the bottom left of the keyboard in the original patent application drawings. The patent was filed in 1878. The Das Keyboard blog shows a Full Duplex keyboard (with separate keys for upper and lower case letters) from 1897 with no ampersand key at all. I have not yet been able to find a reference to the first keyboard to place the ampersand and 7 together. The Wiki article on the ampersand only mentions that it is usually keyed via Shift+7, but occasionally on 6 or 8 instead. Dvorak layouts appear to share similar associations between 7 and &. So is it a coincidence? Or is there some association? 1 This looks really different in the EL&U site fontface. See the linked question or the Wikipedia article for more faithful renderings. \nAnswer: Although the 7 was the ampersand on IBM's standard keyboard layout, that is hardly universal. The first nine printable characters in ASCII are ! \" # $ % & ' ( ), which should give a good clue as to what the top row of a teletype keyboard looked like. On many early teletypes and terminals (and also, BTW, on the Apple ][), the shift key toggled bit 4 of the character being produced, thus it would turn a 1 (011 0001) into ! (010 0001), and , (010 1100) into < (011 1100). Since the digits 1-9 received consecutive code, so did the characters produced by combining them with the shift key. Shift-7 on those keyboards was apostrophe; the ampersand was shift-6. Other typewriter keyboards also varied considerably in where they put the ampersand. Its association with the number 7 is nowhere near as consistent as the association between 1 and !, 3 and #, 4 and $, or 5 and % which existed in both older computer keyboards and today's US arrangement.",

Fowler in Modern English Usage (p670) says: If differentiation were possible between utilize and use it would be that utilize has the special meaning of make good use of, especially of something that was not intended for the purpose but will serve. But this distinction has disappeared beyond recall; utilize is now ordinarily treated as a LONG VARIANT of use. A form is enclosed herewith for favour of your utilization is an example of the pretentious diction that prefers the long word. Partidge in Usage and Abusage (p343) is typically blunt: utilize is, 99 times out of 100, much inferior to use; the other one time it is merely inferior. And here is the more contemporary Grammar Girl's similar take on the issue. Nevertheless, this Usage Note from TheFreeDictionary indicates when utilize might indeed be the better choice: A number of critics have remarked that utilize is an unnecessary substitute for use. It is true that many occurrences of utilize could be replaced by use with no loss to anything but pretentiousness, for example, in sentences such as They utilized questionable methods in their analysis or We hope that many commuters will continue to utilize mass transit after the bridge has reopened. But utilize can mean \"to find a profitable or practical use for.\" Thus the sentence The teachers were unable to use the new computers might mean only that the teachers were unable to operate the computers, whereas The teachers were unable to utilize the new computers suggests that the teachers could not find ways to employ the computers in instruction.",

I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. With that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying? \nAnswer: No Jennifer is from From a Cornish form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar (see GUINEVERE). This name has only been common outside of Cornwall since the beginning of the 20th century, after it was featured in George Bernard Shaw's play 'The Doctor's Dilemma' (1906). GUINEVERE From the Norman French form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar, composed of the elements gwen meaning \"fair, white\" and hwyfar meaning \"smooth\". In Arthurian legend she was the beautiful wife of King Arthur who engaged in an adulterous affair with Sir Lancelot. Her betrayal of her husband with Mordred prompted the battle of Camlann, which led to the deaths of both Mordred and Arthur. The Cornish form of this name, Jennifer, has become popular in the English-speaking world.",

Registry: noun (plural registries) a place or office where registers or records are kept. But yeah, it also says that a registry too can mean a list. And I think 'Registry' is used more in the former context than the later. Even while talking in context of computers we say things like 'Windows Registry'. For me, the word register brings along a sense of being finite but registry does not. like when I think of a register of records, I usually get a quantified picture of the records list comes to my mind, like a page, or a notebook. but 'registry' brings along a picture of non quantifiable !! or its just weird with me.

Your sentence could be rephrased as \"substitute less punishment for more punishment.\" Here we are saying that the amount of punishment is smaller.

The expression makes sense -- a gorilla of that size would certainly be intimidating -- but what's so special about the number 800? Searching \"n lb gorilla\" on Google for various values of n results in many more hits when n = 800 than when n is any other quantity. Also, the Google Ngram Viewer finds notable occurrences of the phrase \"800 pound gorilla\" in texts starting around the late 1970s; other sized gorillas don't seem to be mentioned at all. The Wikipedia entry for the idiom claims that the phrase is rooted in a riddle (\"Where does an 800lb gorilla sleep?\"), but that's just passing the buck. A 700lb or 900lb gorilla would be equally entitled to sleep wherever he wants to. Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry for gorilla states that the average male gorilla weighs about 400lb, occasionally reaching 500lb in the wild. Only obese gorillas in captivity have attained weights of 600lb. So the number doesn't even seem to be related to gorilla biology (except that it is safely larger than any known gorilla, save King Kong). Given that it's an arbitrary figure, is there any reason the number 800 would be more popular than any other? More generally, is there any relevant research into why some numbers would be more popular or pleasing than other in contexts like this? \nAnswer: The answer to your question is No, there is no known reason for preferring 800 to any other number.

In my mother language (Portuguese) Penultimate Payment Date would be fine, but it feels strange in English. (I know feels strange is not very helpful, but I'd like to know how to convey the meaning in the most natural way.) \nAnswer: Someone I know who is a native speaker of Spanish and a professor at a university in the United States has complained that when he used the word \"penultimate\" in class, the students don't know what he's talking about. The word is perfectly, unimpeachably, 100% correct. It is a bit of an upscale, literary word though. It certainly is a \"term of art\" in fields like linguistics, where it is used commonly to refer to syllables. I searched for the word in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, and divided the results by section: spoken, fiction, magazine, newspaper, and academic, and got these results: spoken: 10 fiction: 53 magazine: 55 newspaper: 36 academic: 93 total: 247 So, it is certainly used in all areas of English, with a moderate skew towards higher registers like academic writing. Depending on the intended audience, a writer contemplating using the word \"penultimate\" should consider that there is a relatively high likelihood that word will not be understood. Instead of \"penultimate\", the phrasing in common usage is either \"next to last\" or \"second to last\". Both of those should be universally understood.

The better-understood terms \"second to last\" and \"next to last\" are less common (again, though, in published booksGoogle Ngrams tells us nothing about spoken usage), with \"next to last\" having more historical usage but a slow tapering off of usage since 1960 and \"second to last\" increasing in usage from 1970 on, with both enjoying approximately the same usage today.",

            "input": "Question: I saw an article today that prompted a thought. I only took a year of Latin in high school, so I want to run this by some other people. The article referenced a female senator so-and-so. However, I think that senator, with the -or ending is in the nominative, third declension, which is not gender neutral. So, when referring to a female subject, should senatrix be used instead? Also, does anyone know if there is a reason why the male form is used exclusively? I think females were restricted from the Roman senate perhaps the term just never made sense etymologically because of this? \nAnswer: A number of answers have addressed the fact that in the United States, the use of gender-specific nouns is becoming less fashionable. However, that does not explain why a female equivalent of senator has never existed, only why if it did exist once, it might be less favoured now. I try to answer the etymological question here in relation to senatrix. There is no classical support for senatrix. The word senator was, both originally in English and in Latin, an expression referring exclusively to males, simply for the unfortunate dearth of female senators. In classical Rome, a senator (Latin senator) was always a man, and when the word later came to be used to refer to members of foreign legislatures, to my knowledge all such references were to men. Indeed senator itself essentially meant 'elderly man', from senex, 'old, elderly'. The obvious female equivalent, senatrix, does appear in Lewis & Short, but a brief search on Perseus suggests it is not attested in any major classical source. Of course, Rome had two famous female senators in the tenth century mediaeval senate (or what was left of it), and indeed senatrix was the formal title used by Theorda and Marozia, her daughter*. But they are an anomaly, and were I think of little interest when the word senator was imported into English and first popularized. Therefore we begin with a situation in which anyone who read Latin would know that senatrix was not a classical word, and those of us who delight in imposing arcane Latin grammar rules on unsuspecting English speakers are equally reluctant to pollute the lexicon with artificial Latin words [and anything after August 476 AD doesn't count]. On the use of senatrice in French. The French word sometimes used for a female senator (senatrice) appears to be a backformation from senateur + -trice rather than derived directly from *senatrix. That said, senatrice is long established in the French language, appearing in the 1762 edition of the dictionnaire de L'Academie francaise. This is curious, as in 1762 the ancien regime remained strong and the date long precedes the the establishment of the French Senat in 1799. However my knowledge of French and France is embarrassingly poor, so all I shall say is that 1762 is long after the word senator appeared in English. Therefore senator had become an English word by this time, and I suggest that the continuing evolution of its cognate in French would have had limited effect on the use of senator in English. The Academie francaise now discourages the use of senatrice. There is little use of senatrix at any time in English. A Google Ngram search reveals that senatrix did have a brief period of use in the early twentieth century, around the time that the notion of female senators entered the public discourse. However, a more detailed inspection reveals that this seems to be an upswing in interest about Theodora and Marozia, rather than in the composition of the modern legislature. In that search I did find one tantalizing reference to the 'senatrix from Kansas', but as the reference dates from 1898, eighty years before the first female senator from Kansas, and is entitled 'Judge's Library: A Monthly Magazine of Fun', it cannot be taken at face value. senatrix has little in the way of a history and less in the way of a future. Lacking a sound etymological past, senatrix was not popular among those most likely to have adopted it; and until 1932 there was regrettably very little need for the word to be used at all in popular discourse. As the other answers carefully elucidate, in English, particularly American English, there is a trend away from long-established gender-specific words, so it seems quite unlikely we will see the adoption of any artificial ones any time soon. *You may recall that Gibbon famously describes them in Decline and Fall as 'sister prostitutes', but later sources are quite clear that they were mother and daughter. Gibbon does not use the word senatrix as far as I can see.",

            "input": "Question: I once read that JRR Tolkien, a linguist by profession and of The Lord of the Rings fame, wrote his masterpiece using elements of archaic English to emulate the Bible. Following a question on writers.SE, and comments below, this statement is not as clear as I took it. As non-native speaker, I stumbled upon a few words the first time that I read the book (in original version). It is clear that he did use a few words that, IMHO, were deemed archaic already by the time the novel was published in 1954. Most notably amongst them are the use of thou and thee. He also used less common or less modern words (or meanings), as can be seen in this list. It is even the subject of a book. As an illustration \"Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!\" A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.\" A sword rang as it was drawn. \"Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.\" \"Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!\" Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. \"But no living man am I!\" -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings (source) Tolkien is known to have written a story to give life to made-up languages. And I have the feeling he used (somewhat) old(er) English for the speech of the Elves with Men, equally for educational purpose. I understand that one needs to define some terms, in particular \"archaic\". I would say that archaic words and/or expressions are words and/or expressions that would be out of place (due to it being too old) in a conversation of the time, and which would be noticed by the participants of the conversation as such. Or hasn't been used commonly for 50-100 years. Now, from the elements above, did Tolkien use archaic elements of language when writing the Lord of the Ring? Or do these words strike me as old because I am non-native and/or they are not so much in use today, but were faily common back then (when he wrote it) at least in University circles where he was. PS. I did hesitate to ask this question in Writers.SE, SciFi.SE, ELL.SE or here. But ultimately as it is about English language as such I thought it was better here. But please to tell me if I should ask it somewhere more appropriate? PPS. I hope I managed to limit the \"opinion-based\" part of the question. \nAnswer: The basic answer to your question of whether he used archaic language to emulate the Bible is no, of course not. There is one specific exception, however, which I explain further on. The Lord of the Rings is composed entirely in Modern English using all manner of style and register. This is deliberate. (I will exempt Eomer's \"Westu Theoden hal!\" taken directly from Beowulf's \"Ws u, Hrogar, hal\", as that actually is Old English. Nothing else is.) Tolkien himself specifically explains exactly why he resorts to the second-person singular in certain situations. Please read Appendix F, section II, \"On Translation\" for this and a great deal more about what he was doing, and why, when he attributed different styles of speech to different characters at different times. The Witch-king's use of the second person was intended to be belittling. In Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman, while attempting to present a summary of the book's plot and character, Tolkien states that: . . . even in style it is to include the colloquialism and vulgarity of the Hobbits, poetry and the highest style of prose. So his mixing of low and high, and even of poetry and prose, was done with full awareness and intent. Indeed, in the same Waldman letter he also wrote: Hardly a word in its 600,000 or more has been unconsidered. And the placing, size, style, and contribution to the whole of all the features, incidents, and chapters has been laboriously pondered Perhaps the best explanation for why Tolkien ever used archaic phrasing can be found in his Letter #171, wherein he takes up the accusation of gratuitous \"tushery\" (archaism). He addresses the point of why one would use archaic language to represent what was (purported to be) spoken by an archaic people in this way. Dear Hugh, ....Don't be disturbed! I have not noticed any impertinence (or sycophancy) in your letters; and anyone so appreciative and so perceptive is entitled to criticism. Anyway I do not naturally breathe an air of undiluted incense! It was not what you said (last letter but one, not the one that I answered) or your right to say it, that might have called for a reply, if I had the time for it; but the pain that I always feel when anyone in an age in which almost all auctorial manhandling of English is permitted (especially if disruptive) in the name of art or 'personal expression' immediately dismisses out of court deliberate 'archaism'. The proper use of 'tushery' is to apply it to the kind of bogus 'medieval' stuff which attempts (without knowledge) to give a supposed temporal colour with expletives, such as tush, pish, zounds, marry, and the like. But a real archaic English is far more terse than modern; also many of things said could not be said in our slack and often frivolous idiom. Of course, not being specially well read in modern English, and far more familiar with works in the ancient and 'middle' idioms, my own ear is to some extent affected; so that though I could easily recollect how a modern would put this or that, what comes easiest to mind or pen is not quite that. But take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible): Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the King. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' This is a fair example moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that still are used or known to the educated, the King would really have said 'Nay, thou (n')wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. 'Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualties' and then what? Theoden would certainly think, and probably say 'thus shall I sleep better'! But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave', or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke in a modern style would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism of expression on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. Like some non-Christian making a reference to some Christian belief which did not in fact move him at all. Or p.127, as an example of 'archaism' that cannot be defended as 'dramatic', since it is not in dialogue, but the author's description of the arming of the guests which seemed specially to upset you. But such 'heroic' scenes do not occur in a modern setting to which a modern idiom belongs. Why deliberately ignore, refuse to use the wealth of English which leaves us a choice of styles without any possibility of unintelligibility. I can see no more reason for not using the much terser and more vivid ancient style than for changing the obsolete weapons, helms, shields and hauberks into modern uniforms. 'Helms too they chose' is archaic. Some (wrongly) class it as 'inversion', since normal order is 'They also chose helmets' or 'they chose helmets too'. (Real mod. E. 'They also picked out some helmets and round shields.) But this is not normal order, and if mod. E. has lost the trick of putting a word desired to emphasize (for pictorial, emotional or logical reasons) into prominent first place, without addition of a lot of little 'empty' words (as the Chinese say), so much the worse for it. And so much the better for it the sooner it learns the trick again. And some one must begin the teaching, by example. I am sorry to find you so affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion that its usages per se and simply as 'contemporary' irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid (or even nobler!) have some peculiar validity, above those of other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot under the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time! Also (not to be too donnish) learn to discriminate between the bogus and genuine antique as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer! He does not actually write archaic language, or not fully archaic, for he would have lost the reader. What he does do at times is watered or moderated archaism, and he does this for a distinct reason given above. Every linguistic effect he used has a specific purpose that makes good sense in that context. Tolkien was a master of this, and if you think it all archaic, you haven't been reading closely enough. Look at the rustic speech of the hobbits or the coarse speech of the orcs and trolls: all styles and registers are represented in the book, from the low to the very highest. I would say that most uses of archaic language in fantasy literature written today are fake. That's because there is so much of it, and Sturgeon's Law applies. They are the very embodiment of what Tolkien complained of in his letter to Hugh Brogan. He himself doesn't do that because he actually knew what he was writing. Most people do not, and so their would-be antique language comes off sounding bogus, not authentic. About that exception. The one, and I believe only, place where Tolkien deliberately echoed the KJV is in the chapter \"The Stewart and the King\" from Book VI. The eagle's song found there is quite obviously cast in the stylized language of the Psalms. I believe Tolkien felt that nothing short of Biblical language could suitably convey the \"sudden joy as poignant as grief\" of the unexpected eucatastrophe after all but the wannest of hopes had been forgotten. You really should read Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-Earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, preferably the 2003 edition. Shippey discusses Tolkien's use of language at length. He also shows that all modes of Frye's Anatomy of Criticism are present based on the characters involved, all the way from the mythic to the ironic.",

However, this number feigns in comparison to the number of unique protein sequences that have been discovered, with over 210 million unique sequences present in the UniParc database. However, I am not sure about the \"this number feigns in comparison to\" part. I have a feeling that I am using the wrong word here, but googling around didn't give me any leads. \nAnswer: I thought I would leave the following as I typed it, but I have changed my mind. Ideally, one would say that, \"the [protein] is an order of magnitude greater \". Unfortunately, this would require re-ordering the paragraph, and the current order is better. So skip to after the (second) line. For my money, \"pales etc.\" is just not a strong enough expression here. \"Pales in comparison with\", I venture is used when the first case is impressive, but the second case is so much greater that it makes the first case look entirely unimpressive. An example might be that company X has 140,000 PDB structures, but company Y has 600,000; it is not just somewhat better, but indeed makes the other look er, pale. Again: \"I can run the mile in 7:05, but this pales in comparison with Matthew, who can do it in 5:17.\" I would suggest here, perhaps, \"is an order of magnitude smaller than\". This is about, for example, 10^5 vs 10^6, or 10^5 vs 10^7. (One can resort to saying, \"several orders of magnitude\" if comparing (e.g.) computer storage in 1980 with computer storage today.) I would say that the expression, \"pales in comparison with\", connotes [implies] the same order of magnitude connotes that the things being compared might have been expected to be about the same my mile in 7:05 is pretty good for a typical person, but Matthew is an elite athlete who has been training for a year. (This is not to say that you can not say, \"pales in comparison with\", about something that is 1/10th as good; one might say, \"The {imaginary machine gun} fires 400 rounds per minute, but that pales in comparison with the {imaginary machine gun}, which fires 5000 rounds per minute\" although (again) these are both machine guns.) That is to say that although 140 thousand is indeed impressive (I venture) it is implicit that they are of the same order of magnitude. I am thinking, then, that you might say, \"pales into insignificance beside\" [noting that Michael Harvey mentioned this], which is a way of making the expression stronger, or \"is trivial in comparison with\".",

Egoism, a more subtle term , is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct.

They are technically exotic, native and (at least originally) endemic to the sub-tropical Canary Islands, which gave them their name. They were also renowned for their singing voice, as found out in this answer, and could presumably be quite expensive. So why would a mining company in Britain and/or America and/or any other English speaking country use such an expensive and exotic bird as a glorified carbon monoxide detector whose sole purpose in life was to suffocate to death? Why wouldn't they use sparrows, or starlings, or some other small songbird native to the area? Are canaries just that easy to breed and keep?

I have just encountered for the first time an instance of the phrasing an mule in the book Why Chemical Reactions Happen (James Keeler and Peter Wothers, Oxford University Press, 2003). (This book is not mine. I was sitting opposite a friend when the friend mentioned the unusual phrasing.) This phrasing appears to contradict the rule discussed above, since \"mule\" is, as far as I am aware, pronounced /mjul/ (see Wiktionary). Here is the context. The author is using an analogy to explain a chemistry concept (the italics are not mine, but the bold emphasis is): A useful analogy here is that of an mule, which we get by crossing a horse with a donkey. To describe an mule as a horse or a donkey would be inaccurate and it certainly does not interconvert rapidly between the two! Rather we need to recognize that although an mule has parts that are reminiscent of a horse and parts that a reminiscent of a donkey, it is something altogether different. Looking for other examples online, I have managed to find one on Wikipedia's List of Siege engines. Discussing a Siege engine, the Scorpio: Similar to the ballista, but smaller. Was sometimes mounted on an mule-drawn cart. Other examples are difficult to find, but here's one from a user-posted question on Answers.com (referring, notably, to a kind of deer rather than the animal, a mule): Is an mule deer an omnivore? No. Mule deer are herbivores. ... What is going on? Is there an irregular pronunication of \"mule\" of which I am not aware? Is this some strange language quirk, some archaic spelling that I am encountering for the first time? \nAnswer: The original printing had \"an ass\" instead of \"an mule\". That error was not lost on the chemistry community. See, for instance, Krenos's 2004 review of the text in the Journal of Chemical Education: In Chapter 10, bonding in extended conjugated systems and resonance are introduced with the horse + donkey = ass analogy (it is likely the hybrid animal mule is intended instead of ass, however).

What is the etymology of \"gondola\"? And how did it develop to reference two completely different transportation devices? One on water, the other on mountains? What is the relationship besides their obvious transportation connect? \nAnswer: Some of the successive meanings given in the OED are: 1a. \" A light flat-bottomed boat or skiff in use on the Venetian canals, having a cabin amidships and rising to a sharp point at either end; it is usually propelled by one man at the stern with a single oar.\" U.S. A large flat-bottomed river boat of light build; a lighter; used also as a gun-boat. 4a. \"= gondola-car n.

The metrical pattern of \"ladies and gentlemen\" consists of (arguably) two dactyls. A dactyl is a group of three syllables where the first is stressed and the second two are unstressed. When these occur in succession, they are pleasant to the ear. ladies and gentlemen DUM da da / DUM da da The metrical pattern of \"gentlemen and ladies\" falls into a much less regular pattern. It is less pleasant to the ear. It is something like a stressed syllable followed by three unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable. gentlemen and ladies DUM da da da DUM da Our language tends to organize itself according to regular and pleasant stress patterns.

However, Santa Claus isn't derived from Spanish, but from Dutch, where it was originally rendered as Sante Klaas, and was modified to Santa when it was adopted into English (and from English, to the rest of the world).

Is there a logical or historical reason for the different pronunciations? \nAnswer: That the emergency number 911 is pronounced nine-one-one is probably a standard to avoid confusion or doubt by either children or non-natives to the English language. Pronouncing the number as nine hundred and eleven could be misinterpreted as 90011, hence the emphasis of three digits.

It's obvious what my intent is when I rather carelessly write an I.O.U. for sevum kumquats, but alas, sevum is not really a word and opens up our contract to litigation. Adding the numeral 7 in parenthesis after sevum clarifies the intent. Similarly, if I were to write an I.O.U. for 3 kumquats, one could easily change that 3 to an 8, but it is far more difficult to make three look like eight.

The spellings without periods are quite popular, but informal. For example, Merriam-Webster does not have an entry for either \"eg\" or \"ie\". Wiktionary marks \"eg.\" and \"eg\" as informal, and offers the following usage notes: Opinion is mixed about whether this term should be italicized as although it is Latin, it has become part of standard English, and whether it should be written with a separating space \"e. g.\" as it was originally two separate words. It also offers the following usage notes for \"i.e.\": Opinion is mixed about whether the abbreviation should be italicized, or whether there should be a separating non-breaking space as in i. e.. ie is often found in current usage, and is perhaps now considered acceptable. Personally, I would argue that there's no need whatsoever to italicize \"e.g.\" or \"i.e.\". Both expressions are extremely common in English, and have been for a long time.

The single word finalise carries the connotation of just the last bit, whereas finish needs helper words to carry that connotation (e.g. finish off, finish up). Saying that something is finished can also carry the unwanted sense that it is done for, that is, that it is of no further use; finalise doesn't carry that unwanted sense. In commerce (including the fields of software engineering and management that you specifically referenced), completion isn't always enough. The customer wants confirmation of completion. Transacting parties want the signed agreement that follows the completion of negotiations, or the invoicing and payment that follow the completion of work.

Both are correct for these words: sizable, sizeable sharable, shareable takable, takeable But these words are incorrect: storeable (storable) makeable (makable) tasteable (tastable) minglable (mingleable) acknowledgable (acknowledgeable) managable (manageable) Are there rules for this? The case for keeping the \"e\" seems to be that the \"ga\" in \"acknowledgable\" would be read as \"gall\" rather than \"germ\", but \"minglable\" shouldn't cause that problem. I'm also not sure why we couldn't keep the \"e\" in words like \"storable\" or \"makable\". \nAnswer: The general rule is that you drop the e, provided that it's actually a silent one rather than forming part of an ee digraph as with agreeable, decreeable, disagreeable, foreseeable, and seeable. You only otherwise have to keep a final silent e when adding able if it would (1) either change the pronunciation, or (2) it would cause a collision with an existing word that already means something else altogether different. The first case, pronunciation shift, is for things like raceable or purgeable, where losing the e would make the ce or ge switch from the \"soft\" version to the \"hard\" version due to the resulting g or c now being followed by an a rather than by an e, and cable and gable are pronounced quite differently. The second case, a collision with an existing word, occurs with such pairs as pareable / parable, placeable / placable, probeable / probable, and spareable / sparable. Notice how placeable also has the first factor in play, as too would singeable / singable. Beyond that, there is some slight variation in acceptable forms, such as both microwaveable / microwavable being attested. Normally however, you lose the e. The OED2 attests 1555 words than end in able but not in eable, while only 123 that do actually end in eable. That's a ratio of nearly 13 to 1 in favor of more able words without a preceding e. Not excluding duplicates with alternate spellings, here are the eable words from the OED2 plus quarterly supplements since 2000: acknowledgeable decreeable haveable mingleable salvageable acreable defaceable hireable mortgageable scribbleable activeable delineable holeable nameable seeable adduceable derangeable hopeable negligeable serviceable advanceable disagreeable imageable noticeable shakeable agreeable dischargeable immalleable packageable shapeable allegeable discourageable impermeable pareable shareable arrangeable displaceable inassuageable passageable sizeable balanceable divorceable indulgeable peaceable skateable batheable dyeable ineffaceable permeable sliceable biteable effaceable influenceable pierceable spareable blameable embraceable interchangeable placeable stageable bounceable enforceable irremeable pledgeable strangleable bridgeable exchangeable irreplaceable policeable swindleable carriageable experienceable irretraceable poseable takeable challengeable eyeable judgeable probeable tallageable chanceable fleeceable knowledgeable pronounceable tameable changeable foreseeable likeable purgeable tasteable chargeable forgeable liveable raceable throttleable chaseable garbleable lodgeable rateable traceable chooseable gaugeable malleable reable vengeable commenceable giveable manageable rebukeable voyageable cuddleable gorgeable marriageable replaceable whistleable damageable grazeable microwaveable ropeable danceable hateable mineable saleable As you see, there is also some tendancy to preserve the final e if in the original it's there to make a so-called \"long\" vowel long. However, this doesn't happen consistently enough to make a rule for them. However, for those cases there are a lot of alternate \"sans\"-e forms for those, like ropeable / ropable. Perhaps a more interesting question and certainly one with a more complicated answer is how to know which words instead take ible forms. There are 275 of these in the OED2, more than twice as many as eable words. There are actual rules there, although they are a bit complicated for some people.

Using dynamite for fishing would be another example. I'm looking for a word that describes the use of high-tech equipment, for a purpose that is normally filled by low-tech equipment, usually done out of laziness or amusement. This is specifically relating to technology (overengineering is very close). \nAnswer: One possible term is Overengineering. Overengineering (or over-engineering) is the designing of a product to be more robust or complicated than is necessary for its application....In one form, products are overbuilt, and have performance far in excess of needs (a family sedan that can drive at 300 km/h, or a home video cassette recorder with a projected lifespan of 100 years)....Alternatively, they may be overcomplicated the design may be far more complicated than is necessary for its use, such as a modern text editor asking whether files should be saved in ASCII, EBCDIC or various multi-byte formats.... Source: Wikipedia. Using a drone to replace a light bulb is certainly \"far more complicated than is necessary\", and a drone that is purchased for the purpose of being a light bulb changer would be especially well described by that phrase. Kerievsky (2002), speaking specifically about software engineering but in a way applicable to robotics, writes that overengineering happens when one engineers \"in anticipation of needs that never materialize\". Source: Joshua Kerievsky, April 01, 2002, Stop Over-Engineering!, Dr. Dobb's Journal. A drone-based light bulb changing system could be envisioned as becoming practically useful later if a need arises to change light bulbs located in inconventiently high or inaccessible locations (such as the roof of a stadium, or on the outside of a very tall flagpole), but the majority of people do not encounter such situations frequently, if at all.",

Rex': \"Her record at Hewlett-Packard firing skilled Americans by the thousands and outsourcing their jobs to China and India, while almost running her company into the ground with an ill-advised merger is hardly a sterling record for any sort of candidate, assuming we actually want a president of all the people rather than a modern Ebenezer Scrooge, - - This is a woman who would deny other women control over their own bodies, as well. \"If she's a feminist then I'm a T. rex.\" According to Jurassic wiki, Tyrannosaurus rex, the most famous of all dinosaurs species and commonly known as T. rex, was the largest of the Tyrannosaur family and by extension one of the largest theropods, reaching 12 to 13 meters in length. But what does 'If she's a feminist, then I'm a T. Rex' mean? Does the writer sarcastically admit herself being anachronistic? Why should it be a T.Rex, not other monsterous or supernatural creatures, say, Moby-Dick and Godzilla? Is this a cute turn of phrase? Could you translate \"I'm a T.rex\" into plain English? \nAnswer: Carly Fiorina is being attacked by feminists for her pretty negative comment on Planned Parenthood as she insisted at the CNN GOP primary debate that this organization is cruelly killing unborn babies to sell their organs for research. A vidoe footage on which she based her claim was found doctored by fact-checkers. Some Republican governors defunded Planned Parenthood in their states and they are fighting hard to defund it at a national level. This is what makes Carly Fiorina an anti-feminist and the author is using metaphor with the least possible thing that anyone can be if she is a feminist. REX of T-rex means a King and what a better metaphor to attack her who wants to be POTUS (President of the United States).",

            "input": "Question: This question, \"Discrete Units of a Continuous Quantity\", asks whether units of a continuous quantity should be spoken of as discrete or continuous. The top answer states The rule is simple, and you obviously know it: discrete quantities require the use of \"fewer\" and continuous quantities require the use of \"less\". Calorie, as a unit, requires the use of \"fewer\". Energy, as a continuum, requires the use of \"less\". \"Fewer calories means less energy.\" I do not understand the logic here though. Calorie is a unit, yes, but it is a continuous unit (it is possible to have half a calorie, or 4.582394 calories). Since a calorie is such a small unit of energy compared to what it is usually used for (food energy and human metabolism), it is very seldom expressed in a fractional form and instead is rounded (usually to the nearest 10 or higher). Why then should \"fewer\" be used with calorie instead of \"less\"? Is there another relevant rule than just \"continuous quantities use \"less\" and discrete quantities use \"fewer\"? \nAnswer: We simply don't speak of 5 Energy. The key difference here, mathematically, is rationals vs real numbers. That is, even if you cut your kilocalories in half, you would always have a finite-length number to describe the amount. Hence, the rationals as well as the natural numbers are called countable. The set of Real Numbers on the other hand is an uncountable set, because for every finite-length number, you can have an infinite amount of infinite-length real numbers that start with the finite length number. The details are tricky, I'm not a maths teacher. So far so good. Why then is energy uncountable? It's a historically grown thing. The whys and hows of this fact should be part of a different question, though. (I mean, I really don't know).

Jim's example, It allows to pass certain particles while trapping others, is certainly, as he says, unwieldy because it's not parallel: It allows to pass certain particles and {allows not / disallows} others. which is a style monster regardless of the parallel construction. It should be: It allows certain particles to pass {while trapping / but traps / but disallows} others. The syntax is so bad in that sentence that, however grammatically valid it is, Fowler would retch after reading it.

Anderson: [takes the money and puts it into his pocket] Reflection: John exclaimed when he saw the money in the road, but he didn't try to take it. Anderson was smarter, as, when he saw John exclaiming, he took the money and put it into his pocket. Consequently, John now repents his foolish excitement. My question is, is there a proverb for such situations? EDIT: When I asked my friend, he suggested the following saying: \"Some feel the rain others just get wet.\" \nAnswer: One very common, albiet obnoxious phrase would be: Finders, keepers; Losers, weepers While this generally relates to the idea that once you find something that appears to be unowned - it is now your property - and not necessarily the idea of missing out on something, because you were too slow to act on it. It's such a common phrase in childhood, that it can be applied obnoxiously to imply \"now that I've picked it up, it's mine - you cannot complain about it\". In this case, the one who picked it up first would consider themself the \"Finder\" and the one who lost out on it (the original owner, and the person who was too slow to pick it up) would be considered the \"Loser\". Again, it's not a perfect phrase for this situation, but it is such a common idiom that it does get applied frequently to these kind of situations.",

I did not err, there does a sable cloud, Turn out her silver lining on the night And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.

Second, shall I break the sentence into two or keep it compact in one? Third, any better way for saying that my profile meets their requirements? Any help on any of these questions will be appreciated. ////// \nAnswer: Oh my. About the only thing good I can say about your cover letter is that you knew to ask for help. Your original statement doesn't convey what it literally says. The primary point any reader is going to take away is \"English is not my first language and I have difficulty communicating.\" masarah's improvement is... an improvement. But it's not going to get you the job in a competitive market. The awkward word choice and sentence construction is gone, although it still is passive and overly wordy. Worse, it still gives the distinct impression that you're sending the same cover letter to dozens of companies, and probably didn't even read the requirements that you say you meet. The primary problem is that you're trying to evaluate your own suitability for the position. That simply won't fly. For one thing, it implies that the recruiter or HR department is redundant, which is going to make a bad impression on the first person to see your resume, even if it were true. Bigger issue: why would they trust your assessment, since you're obviously biased (you want them to offer you the job). My high school English teacher (English is my first language, so this was a writing course, not a foreign language course) gave the advice \"show, don't tell\", and this applies in this situation. Don't tell them \"My profile matches the requirements.\" or \"My experience matches the requirements.\" Instead pull a couple highlights from your resume that you feel give you the necessary background, and say something like \"I look forward to applying my experience taking notes in class to making sure your medical records are clear and concise and don't miss any important details.\" Of course, you should talk about your actual experience and the tasks that you will do in the position you are applying for. Same thing goes for expressing interest in the position. You did some research on what the company does, right? You don't want to say, \"I'm interested in this position because it meets my career goals.\" Instead, \"I'm excited about joining your team that is on the cutting edge of research in whatever.\" or \"I feel that the work your company does in providing education to the unemployed is vitally important. I would love to help give people a second chance at life.\" Make it specific to the work this position entails, and your prior related experience. Let them draw the conclusion that you're a good fit. If you want to make it easy for the recruiter to check that you meet the requirements, use a highlighter on your resume. But that's not what a cover letter is for.",

In German we have a word for that, \"Sattigung\", which means how full my stomach is (or better: how full it feels to me), it is basically the opposite of hunger. Is there a similar word in English, which means exactly that, the opposite of hunger? It might be something like \"saturation\", but from what I can tell this word is usually used in a technical context, like in \"the saturation of a color\". Can I use that \"saturation\" to describe the opposite of hunger of a human or animal, or is there a better word for that? \nAnswer: Stomach-Level Stomach-level suggests the actual level to which the stomach is full. Native English speakers will imagine the stomach as a pot or container which is literally full 'up to here' - full to a certain point. Satiety is a correct term but may not be understood by all users as it's a rather advanced word. Satisfaction is a bit abstract and not so much to do with literally 'how full you are' but rather the pleasing effect that the food had on you. If you want to use stomach level, it could also be used for hunger level. One term could fulfil both functions. Then if hungry, it might also say 'hungry' or if full, it could say 'full' or 'sated' (sated is also a bit of an advanced word). Or for very full it could say 'stuffed', which is humorous.",

Is any form more common in British or American English? Erik Kowal claims that shit is mostly American English and shat British English. [M]ost Americans don't change the verb form for the past tense of certain short verbs ending in -it. So fit, spit, shit, slit and pit are thus formed both in the present and the past tense as far as Americans are concerned, whereas people from Britain would almost always use fitted, spat, shat, slitted and pitted for the past tense. What about shitted? \nAnswer: The OED's etymology for this word is: The form shite represents OE. *scitan, pa. t. *scat, pa. pple. -sciten (in be-sciten), corresponding to OFris. *skita (NFris. skitj, pa. t. skad, pa. pple. skedden), MLG. schiten, Dutch schijten, OHG. scian (MHG. schian, mod.G. scheissen), ONor. skita (MSw. skita, Da. skide), f. OTeut. root skit-. The now more common form shit is influenced by the pa. pple. or the related sb. As far as modern/current forms go, it says that: The present tense is either shit or shite. For the past tense, the OED gives all three of shit, shat, shitted as current. So the answer to your question is yes. For the past participle, the OED provides only shit and shat, with shitten last appearing in the 19th century. That means you won't find any one \"correct\" answer.

For example (15 December 2019): \"[A police officer] said the man who had been shot was in a \"critical but stable \" condition in hospital.\" I understand that \"critically ill\" means that life is in danger. Similarly \"stable\" is the opposite. Quotes from www.lexico.com critically To an extreme degree with a risk of death. 'two critically wounded people died in hospital'. 'critically ill patients who were awaiting surgery' stable (of a patient or their medical condition) not deteriorating in health after an injury or operation. 'he is now in a stable condition in hospital' What does \"critical but stable\" really mean? \nAnswer: Trying to find a meaning in these words by following a definition is the wrong approach, as critical but stable is a kind of euphemism. Much in the same way as the wording \"according to circumstances\" is, depending on how it's being said, either a polite way of saying: \"I have no idea!\", or \"I'm not going to tell you!\". Most certainly, every patient's condition is \"according to circumstances\" (whatever the circumstances may be!), so basically saying that is nothing but saying: \"Bugger off!\", only more polite, and less troubling for people who are emotinally involved. Because after all, if the situation is good according to circumstances, that's quite positive, is it not! Similarly, when you say \"critical\", then that means as much as \"that doesn't look good, I expect the person may die\". You do not say that to either relatives or in public. You do not say that to, or nearby, the patient (awake or unconcious) either. Never, not ever. The consequences of saying such a thing may be terrible. Thus, when you are saying such a thing, you add \"but stable\" which in reality means nothing more but \"we're currently not desperately trying to stop this bleeding, and we're currently not reanimating\". But still, although the word \"stable\" has absolutely no meaning in terms of \"condition will not change\" (or even \"condition will not change to the worse\"), and usually people know very well that it is a kind of \"lie\", it is still very much appeasing the perceived situation for people directly involved.",

The group of people constitute a jury. A group of crows is called a 'murder'. A group of crows are called a 'murder'. My instinct is that it depends on whether the verb is referncing the group itself or the members of the group directly, but is that right? \nAnswer: According to the OALD, group can actually serve as either a plural or singular noun. The category they give is \"countable + singular or plural verb\". So, an example of correct use is: A group of us is/are going to the theatre this evening. For any of your examples, both is and are can be used. I think the difference between them is as you say: use is when you are referring to the group, and use are when you are referring to the members of a given group. This page on when to use \"group\" as plural from Washington State University backs this up, saying: When the group is being considered as a whole, it can be treated as a single entity: \"the group was ready to go on stage.\" But when the individuality of its members is being emphasized, \"group\" is plural: \"the group were in disagreement about where to go for dinner.\" To analyze your given examples, here are some notes: A sentence is a group of words that is followed by a period. Use this form if you're talking about the group itself. That is, a sentence is a group of words followed by a period. A sentence is a group of words that are followed by a period.

What about after an exclamation mark or semicolon? \nAnswer: Did the sentence end after the question mark? Yes. Then you need a capital letter to start the new sentence, just as usual. No. Then the question mark shouldn't have been there, since it ends a sentence. Right, I should expand on that rather than just be a grumpy old man. The capitalization rule that we care about here is that the first word of a sentence starts with a capital letter, so the question is really about what ends a sentence. The answer to that is easy: terminal punctuation, i.e. a full stop (or period if you're American), question mark or exclamation mark. There's a visual clue in that '?' and '!' are decorated full stops; you just have to remember that a colon (':') isn't really a decorated full stop, not that you'd ever know by looking at it. Colons, semicolons and commas aren't terminal punctuation, so they don't end a sentence and so don't force the next letter to be a capital. It may be a capital letter for some other reason such as being the start of a proper name, but not because it is starting a sentence. There are exceptions to this rule, occasions when '?' and '!' become non-terminal punctuation. The most obvious is in quoted speech: if the speaker asks a question or makes an exclamation, the '?' or '!' doesn't have to be terminal if the sentence carries on after the quote. \"Should I write it like this?\" he asked. \"Or perhaps like this?\" The other class of exception is for what are probably really parenthetical comments. If you have a short phrase that you could have put aside in parentheses or dashes, then a question mark or exclamation mark can be used at the end of that phrase without ending the sentence. Be sparing with this. It looks wrong at a first read, and engenders the sort of argument I had with Jason in the comments below! Should I write it like this, or abracadabra! like this? Going back to the examples, and adding a few more for fun: Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this, or perhaps like that? \"Should I write it like this?\" he asked, \"or perhaps like that?\" Example 2 with the lowercase \"or\" is just plain wrong. Crusty old grammarians who disapprove of starting sentences with conjunctions may frown at example 1 all they like, but it's a perfectly acceptable fragmentary sentence. Whether it's the right answer or not is another question entirely. Example 1 makes the point that the questions are distinct, though they are strongly linked otherwise the whole structure wouldn't work. Example 3 on the other hand emphasizes that the two questions are options in a common situation, as well as reflecting a different way of saying them. That is obvious in this case because the two questions really are tightly coupled alternatives. However, consider the following: Are the lights green? Or is the switch up? Are the lights green, or is the switch up? Both of these examples imply that the state of the lights and the state of the switch are related somehow. Version 2 couples them more tightly; I would usually assume (without more context) that either this is the same question being asked in two different ways (i.e. that the switch being up should cause the lights to be green), or that they are an exhaustive list of possibilities (either the switch is up or the lights are green, but not both or neither). This isn't an absolute rule, but it is quite strongly implied. Example 4 is also wrong, though it has a better disguise. If you unwrap the quotes, what you get is: Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? which is our duff example 2 back again. What you actually want is one of: \"Should I write it like this?\" he asked. \"Or perhaps like this?\" (i.e. example 1) \"Should I write it like this,\" he asked, \"or perhaps like that?

            "input": "Question: Possible Duplicate: When do I use \"I\" instead of \"me?\" A friend of mine asked me for advice about an e-mail he was writing. There was a sentence like this: I and my partners we are interested in investing in your product. I figured it was wrong, so I suggested: I and my partners are interested in investing in your product. This looks grammatical to me but sounds strange. Also, I have seen a lot of people writing this: Me and my partners we are interested in investing in your product. which I believe is not grammatical. So, which one of the options above is correct? Also, what would be a better choice of words? \nAnswer: \"I and someone are interested\" is grammatically correct. It is the convention in English that when you list several people including yourself, you put yourself last, so you really should say \"Someone and I are interested.\" \"Someone and I\" is the subject of the sentence, so you should use the subjective case \"I\" rather than the objective \"me\". \"Someone and I\" clearly means two people, so you should use \"are\" and not \"is\". If it was \"Someone or I ...\" then you would use \"is\", because only one person is interested, either \"someone\" or \"I\". It is not uncommon to hear people say \"Me and someone are ...\", but this is wrong because it's the wrong case. When an educated person hears \"Me and Billy is going to the ball game\", he immediately thinks this is either a child or a very uneducated person speaking. \"I and someone we ...\" is incorrect because it is redundant. \"We\" is simply another way of saying \"I and someone\". It adds no new information to the sentence, and so there is no reason to include it. You can't just string together alternative ways of expressing the same idea: If you really need it for clarity or emphasis, you have to surround it with some additional words, like a \"that is\", or sometimes just punctuation that show its purpose in the sentence. You could say, \"We, that is, Bob and I, are interested ...\" All that said, \"I and someone\" or \"Someone and I\" sounds strange to me, and I suspect most English speakers, because it is an unusual use of the word \"someone\". When \"someone\" is used in a list with identifiers of other people, we usually say \"someone else\". Like, \"Bob and someone else are interested ...\" rather than \"Bob and someone are interested ...\" (I have no idea why this is so; it's just the convention.) \"Someone\" without \"else\" is normally only used when it's the only person: \"Someone is interesteed ...\".",

I have just encountered for the first time an instance of the phrasing an mule in the book Why Chemical Reactions Happen (James Keeler and Peter Wothers, Oxford University Press, 2003). (This book is not mine. I was sitting opposite a friend when the friend mentioned the unusual phrasing.) This phrasing appears to contradict the rule discussed above, since \"mule\" is, as far as I am aware, pronounced /mjul/ (see Wiktionary). Here is the context. The author is using an analogy to explain a chemistry concept (the italics are not mine, but the bold emphasis is): A useful analogy here is that of an mule, which we get by crossing a horse with a donkey. To describe an mule as a horse or a donkey would be inaccurate and it certainly does not interconvert rapidly between the two! Rather we need to recognize that although an mule has parts that are reminiscent of a horse and parts that a reminiscent of a donkey, it is something altogether different. Looking for other examples online, I have managed to find one on Wikipedia's List of Siege engines. Discussing a Siege engine, the Scorpio: Similar to the ballista, but smaller.

No. Mule deer are herbivores. ... What is going on? Is there an irregular pronunication of \"mule\" of which I am not aware?

That would have been changed because it's incorrect (an ass is a donkey, not a horsedonkey cross) and, even if it were correct, the fact that ass means well, you know, ass, might be distracting enough to make it worth changing. Another source of this kind of typo is when an adjective has been added or removed and the article hasn't been updated (e.g., \"an elephant\" becoming \"an big elephant\" or \"an amazing coincidence\" becoming \"an coincidence\"). That's presumably not happened in this particular text, since there are several instances of \"an mule\".",

Being non-native (and only seeing a still frame of the scene) I thought it meant \"How does Maria solve problems?\". Somewhat similar to \"What would Jesus do?\". Can \"solve a problem like [someone]\" also be understood in this way? Edits: I am aware of the context. It would be silly to think the singing nuns hold up Maria (Julie Andrews) as a role model. I checked my Quirk/Greenbaum grammar but have trouble finding anything conclusive concerning this usage of [like] and its validity. I do have to admit, that I didn't look very thoroughly. I am a bit like Maria, in this way. \nAnswer: You're right: \"How do you solve a problem like Maria?\" is syntactically ambiguous. The phrase \"like Maria\" can modify either a preceding noun phrase (\"a problem\") or a preceding verb phrase (\"solve a problem\"). Both of these usages are recognized as valid by traditional prescriptive grammars (Fowler 1926 describes \"He talks like an expert\" as an \"unexceptionable\" usage of like, where \"like is equivalent to a prepositional adverb\"p. 325 in republished 2009 edition). Prescriptive grammars have traditionally condemned a third use of like, the use \"as a conjunction\" where it is followed by a clause (e.g. \"like Maria does\") rather than by a noun phrase. However, as the comments point out, that construction would allow you to express \"How do you solve problems the way that Maria solves problems\" without ambiguity. Many modern linguists analyze like as a preposition when it takes a bare noun phrase like \"Maria\" as its complement (although like is not always a preposition, and even when it is, it doesn't always behave exactly the same way as other prepositions). The same kind of ambiguity is seen with many prepositional phrases, as illustrated by the joke \"One morning, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know,\" which relies on this ambiguity. You can see further examples and discussion in the answers to Does \"I am eating vegan cheese in my underpants\" really imply that the vegan cheese is inside my underpants?

Being non-native (and only seeing a still frame of the scene) I thought it meant \"How does Maria solve problems?\". Somewhat similar to \"What would Jesus do?\". Can \"solve a problem like [someone]\" also be understood in this way? Edits: I am aware of the context. It would be silly to think the singing nuns hold up Maria (Julie Andrews) as a role model. I checked my Quirk/Greenbaum grammar but have trouble finding anything conclusive concerning this usage of [like] and its validity. I do have to admit, that I didn't look very thoroughly. I am a bit like Maria, in this way. \nAnswer: I believe it is important to keep in mind that the sentence in question is part of a song. Music, like poetry, is an art form that requires interpretation. Taking a single sentence from a song and trying to interpret it strictly on the basis of English language rules is bound to add confusion, especially for a non-native speaker. Furthermore, this is a song from a musical, and that particular genre of theatre and film absolutely relies on the synergistic combination of music, lyrics, script, scene, and acting to fully convey its message. Consider the song \"People Will Say We're in Love\", from another musical production from the same era, called Oklahoma!. The lyrics ask, \"why do people think we are in love?\" and then list many ways that the couple could avoid doing things that make others gossip about them this way. Taken out of context, the lyrics mostly imply that these two people do not like each other, yet there are some phrases that imply the opposite. For example, she calls him, \"Sweetheart\" just after telling him to return some personal possessions of hers. And he says, \"Your hand feels so grand in mine\" just after admonishing her, \"Don't keep your hand in mine.\" However, from watching the performance, it is quite clear that they are indeed in love and trying to pretend otherwise. Watch how she looks at him with passion or how he holds her hand while singing those lyrics, and the meaning of the words is completely different. (Much like real life, one might say.) The lyrics alone also do not readily show that the song is a duet, which adds a great deal of context to the words. In the spoken script, just preceding the song, the male and female leads are having a conversation about an upcoming picnic, which the woman plans to attend with someone else. The man wants her to attend the picnic with him, and she says it will cause people to \"talk\" (gossip). They begin to discuss how folks love to gossip and, in the style of a musical, this conversation morphs into a song. Much more about their true relationship is implied by their flirtatious acting during the song than the lyrics themselves provide. By the end of the song, they are holding hands, smiling, and cheek-to-cheek, while the male lead sings, \"Don't dance all night with me...People will say we're in love.\" Contradictory? Yes! And that is exactly the point. The Sound of Music is a film and theatre production of the same era and genre as Oklahoma! so there are many style similarities. In order to fully understand the song lyrics, you must also understand the full context of the scene with Maria and the nuns, including what has happened just before the song begins. We already know that Maria is out in the hills enjoying nature (and singing, of course!). The nuns are quietly discussing the new \"recruits\" and the subject of Maria comes up. They talk about her lack of discipline and yet she is also likable. As with all musicals, this conversation segues into a song. At the end, Maria herself comes running into the abbey, hair a mess, late for prayer again, and stops short in front of the sisters who stop singing. She tidies herself and tries to walk away with decorum, then the nuns resume singing the final \"impossible problem\" line: \"how do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?\" The entire scene must be taken together, along with prior scenes which establish that Maria herself IS the problem that the nuns do not know how to solve. It is certainly not standard English to write or speak the way this sentence is written, but in a musical for stage or film, the rules do not always apply. In fact, it is in large part, the breaking of rules -- like solemn nuns randomly breaking into song -- that makes the musical theatre genre so unique and engaging.",

For example, in Russian we say otkrit' (open the book), but in the Old slavonic the verb razognuti (to unbend the book) was used. \nAnswer: This is a very interesting question. There may not be an old word in English that does what you describe, but it is important to note that the English word \"open\" relative to a book meant something different in earlier times. To open a book now usually means to part or spread the cover and the pages into a position so you can read the pages contained in the book. However, books used to be made by folding sheets of paper larger than the page size and they would be sold without trimming the edges, so when you got your new book, it would be \"unopened\" meaning that you couldn't turn the pages. You had to \"open\" the book with a dull knife (like a letter opener) by ripping along the folds. (This is why some books have ragged edges of the text block, to evoke the memory of those ripped page edges.) The OED has e. transitive. To cut open the leaves of (a book) when they have been left joined along an edge during the making; to cut open (the leaves) of such a book. You will find old books described (by knowledgable book dealers) as \"unopened\". This correctly means that the folded sheets are un-ripped; it doesn't mean that no-one has ever spread the covers and looked inside.",

For example, in a literary paper, don't do this: \"Miss Watson's big [N-WORD], named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him.\" (Twain 58) And in the case of your presentation, you are of course allowed to say \"New Negro Movement.\" Just note that it is a term that some people may find offensive, so be mature about it.

People leave their dishes unwashed overnight, and lo and behold, the next morning the dishes are clean thanks to the washing up fairy. Sadly, she (I assume it's a she) is more often noted in her absence than her presence. As in \"The washing up fairy didn't come, I'll have to do the dishes now.\" An example of her being mentioned: Her theory is simple we must replace the behaviours we don't want with those we do. For example, leaving dirty dishes on the kitchen bench for the washing-up fairy to tidy should be replaced with loading the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. Her existence has been documented neither by Wiktionary nor Urban Dictionary. Is her distribution limited to Australia, and presumably New Zealand, plus the households of those who have moved from these countries? \nAnswer: In the U.S. the phrase for cleaning the dishes after a meal is to wash the dishes (generically, to wash dishes). The action nominalization is dishwashing (with or without hyphen or space) in either case. One can say wash up instead of wash the dishes, in context, but wash up in the U.S. is just one more phrasal verb and does not have the specific connotation it does in the UK (rather like fry up, which in the US just means to fry things until they're done, and is never nominalized as a fry-up). Wash up in the U.S. can also mean to wash oneself (short of a full bath or shower), or to wash one's hands preparatory to a meal; it can form the action nominalization a wash-up, but this is more likely to refer to handwashing than dishwashing. As to fairies in the U.S, I am personally a firm devotee of the Parking Fairy, and, influenced by Fairiology as presented in Pratchett's Hogfather, I have recently come to discern the importance of the Traffic Fairy in our lives; many U.S. children believe in the Tooth Fairy; and Jim McCawley used to say, of some people, that \"the Mind Fairy must have come and left a quarter under their pillow\". So, while most Americans will understand the washing up fairy as it's intended to be understood, if they hear it -- particularly if it's delivered in a non-American accent -- Americans don't normally use that phrase.",

            "input": "Question: Possible Duplicate: Pronunciation of voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ as (/sh/) in slang? My understanding was that the cluster \"str\", for example in \"stress\", is usually pronounced /sts/, just like Wiktionary mentions. Their audio sample confirms this. However, I sometimes hear a different kind of pronunciation, namely \"shtress\" or something like /ts/ (forgive my IPA knowledge). As an example, Jay Z is rapping about the \"New York city shtreets\" (here at ~ 0:30), not \"streets\". The actors from the Jersey Shore seem to do it as well, so I'm starting to believe this is an East Coast / New York thing? So, regarding this oddity: Where in the English world do people speak like this? Is this even localized to a certain area? Is this a recent development? I didn't hear about this back when I was learning English at school. More formally, is this a \"mistake\"? My naive explanation would be that it's simply a natural development because the \"sh\" forms automatically when you pull back your tongue from forming an \"s\" to \"r\". \nAnswer: After digging for a while, I found the answer in a paper called Assimilation at a Distance by Wayne P. Lawrence.1 It's a little dated (2000), but also cites studies from 1993 and earlier describing this phenomenon. The recent history of American English includes a sound change that seems to have gone unattested in the scholarly literature.1 This is the change of /s/ to // before /tr/ (i.e., a PHONEMIC CHANGE), which involves a palatalization of the initial sound in the cluster /str/, typically in initial position but not exclusively. The author further mentions that \"this phonemic change seems to be neither dialectal nor regional.\" However, it's definitely an American English peculiarity. It seems that it was first heard on television or radio broadcasts and became popular over these channels. Of course, the internet helps spreading such a linguistic \"oddity\" and even I know I picked it up from television shows and continue to (subconciously) use this pronunciation. Regarding the phonetic principles behind this change, Lawrence summarizes: More concretely, this pronunciation is an implicit \"assertion\" on their part that in their grammar /r/, being [+ interrupted], is marked with respect to the opposition INTERRUPTED versus CONTINUOUS - exactly the same way that [], being [+ compact], is marked with respect to the opposition COMPACT versus DIFFUSE. The marked character of /r/ is prompted and confirmed phonetically, of course, by its high degree of retroflection in American English.7 This would explain the fact that we only hear this in American English. What's interesting is that the same does not appear to happen to \"spr\", which can be explained by the phonetic differences in \"t\" and \"p\": I would surmise, therefore, that /str/ lends itself to realization as [tr] while /spr/ remains unaltered also due to the phonological value of /t/ and /p/. Another more recent paper was written by David Durian.2 It goes into the details of social background and \"shtr\" as well as providing some more explanations for its development. 1 Lawrence, Wayne P.

            "input": "Question: Is there a word that describes or denotes a type of conversation in which two speakers speak two different languages. In our country, Pakistan, there are approximately 75 languages, from which Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi are common, excluding English. So today I found two women speaking two different languages. For example: Speaker 1 has Urdu as their mother tongue. Speaker 2 has Sindhi as their mother tongue. Speaker 1 and 2 spoke their own mother tongue, which are different (Urdu and Sindhi) but both can understand each other's language. I thought that this is known as \"intermingling conversation,\" or a \"code switching.\" In my opinion, we can't use such words because code-switching refers \"shifting completely to the other language for a word, a phrase or sentence, and then revert back to the base language.\" Example sentences: They were in a bus and had [adjective] conversation. They were in a bus and had [noun or noun-phrase for such conversation]. I agree that the question (which is suspected as a duplicate one to this question) is really a duplicate, but its single answer still doesn't satisfy all. In that question, the phrase \"bilingual dialogue\" was suggested, which I (and others may) think that this refers to the code switching as well, which I don't want here.

In the accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Equityif an asset account increases (a debit), then either another asset account must decrease (a credit), or a liability or equity account must increase (a credit).

            "input": "Question: Possible Duplicate: Capitalization for a bullet list Let's say I have a bullet point list e.g: Point 1. Point 2. Point 3. Notice I have put a capital letter for the starting letter of every bullet point and a full stop at the end. Is this the correct way to do it? If not, what is the correct way to do it? Do I put a capital letter and no full stop, or, the other way around, a full stop and no capital letter? Alternatively, do I not put a capital letter or a full stop? Is it only necessary to put a capital letter on the first bullet point and full stop on the last bullet point? For reference, I'm from the UK so British-English grammar would apply. \nAnswer: I found a site quoting the Chicago Manual of Style. I don't have the style manual handy, but this advice mirrors what I know from my personal experience. \"A vertical list is best introduced by a complete grammatical sentence, followed by a colon. Items carry no closing punctuation unless they consist of complete sentences. If the items are numbered, a period follows the numeral and each item begins with a capital letter. To avoid long, skinny lists, short items may be arranged in two or more columns. If items run over a line, the second and subsequent lines are usually indented.\" CMOS (6.127-28) So if you're just listing points you would do: point 1 point 2 point 3 (it is only necessary to capitalize points if they are \"longer phrases\" or follow a numbered list.) If you were describing them, it might be: This is something about point 1. This is something about point 2. This is something about point 3.

The vowel of the preposition \"of\" is almost always reduced in actual speech, yielding /v/. Thus \"would've\" and \"would of\" are homophones. So no surprise that some people spell it that way, even though it makes no grammatical sense. Would've can be even further reduced to /wd/, which some people spell woulda as a kind of phonetic eye dialect to represent actual speech or set an informal tone.

Therefore, \"to denigrate someone\" would be \"to blacken that person\". Considering its current definition (see below) and the wish to be politically correct, I wonder whether the word has come to acquire any racist overtone. The reason why I'm asking is because I was reading \"Language Myths\" a book by Laurie Bauer recently, and came across this passage which contained that word \"...certain educational institutions denigrate the way certain ethnic minorities and lower-working-class children talk.\" Then I remembered I was once told not to use \"denigrate\" as it might be misinterpreted by some people. denigrate - from Merriam-Webster 1. to say very critical and often unfair things about (someone) 2. to attack the reputation of, to deny the importance or validity of, belittle EDIT (on Dec 17th, 2017) - This article, Dark Words Of Disapproval which Mari-Lou A mentions in one of the comments, shows very clearly the writer's feelings about this word, with very good arguments to bear him out.

Tolson, the character played by Denzel Washington in the 2007 feature film \"The Great Debaters\", says the word has racist undertones. - Edit (on May 6th, 2020) \nAnswer: I don't see why this question has received such negative responses. I think it's a good question. \"Blacken\" indeed has a trans-historical meaning associated with vilification or corruption, but this has nothing to do with the inherent qualities of black people, animals, or the vast majority of black things. Would you consider the term \"blacklist\" racist? If not, then you shouldn't see \"denigrate\" as racist. Anyone who does is being a little silly. If you're worried, you could always replace it with \"disparage.\" EDIT: Another example is use of the term \"sinister\" to mean \"wicked.\" This word comes from Latin \"sinister,\" meaning \"left\" or \"on the left side.\" Over time, the mythologized connection of the left hand to the false or unfavorable came to give \"sinister\" an association with the unsavory.

Or, to put it the other way, why can't I \"de-contract\" this without moving the not over by a word? \nAnswer: Even though the standard term for these combinations of an auxiliary + -n't is \"contractions\", grammatically they act like single, indivisible words*; rather than like two words slurred together (though that was evidently their historical origin).

I point you to the text of the annotation on the right side of the page where it pairs this term with the same kind of glyph you posted: Open pages of the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, showing an ornate section break on the lower left page created from asterisks.

I know that the underlying question has been answered, my problem is of a different nature: I'm currently writing my master's thesis in CS and my professor thinks that the apostrophe possessive is only applicable to people. He claims to have spoken to a linguist from Cambridge who confirmed his opinion. Neither my professor nor I am a native speaker and the thesis is being written in Germany. Now, I know that he won't care if I just send him a couple of links to the answers here. So my question is: How do I convince my professor? Are there any \"more scientific\u2122\" sources that I can point to? Examples of phrases: If each plant's humidity is displayed publicly [...] [...] shows an overview of the node's structure. Due to an issue in the network stack's IPv6 subsystem [...] \nAnswer: As few people are addressing the '\"more scientific\u2122\" sources' bit of the question, it should be pointed out that there are a number of English style guides out there, practically all of which should cover the topic of forming possessives with apostrophe-s (as it's a frequent issue even with native speakers). You should be able to find copies of at least one of the major ones in any decent University library. (At least at any decent University with English classes.) The Elements of Style by Strunk and White is the \"gold standard\" for many Americans, although there are many who disagree with many of the details. The Chicago Manual of Style is a well-used standard for (American) University usage. - The online version is unapologetic and direct on this topic: \"The possessive of most singular nouns is formed by adding an apostrophe and an s\", although it does go into more details. Fowler's modern English usage by Henry Fowler is also a well-regarded standard, particularly for British users. The Cambridge Guide to English Usage by Pam Peters has the benefit of the \"authority\" of Cambridge. Oxford, of course, has their own: The New Oxford Style Manual, though the title has varied with edition. If physical copies aren't something you're interested in, a number of organizations (particularly journalism houses) have their house style guides online. For example, the Economist makes no mention of the conjectured rule in its advice. The Guardian gives additional examples, and also completely omits the purported rule. Others can likely be found by searching, and other major organizations (like the Associate Press and the New York Times) have theirs as printed books. Many dictionaries also have usage notes in them. (In particular, I'll point out the comment from @ps2goat mentioning Oxford Dictionaries's online page.) Ultimately, though, it's exceedingly difficult to prove a negative. Even confronted with evidence that a large number of style guides and usage manuals for English have nothing approaching the purported rule, your professor might not be convinced that he is mistaken. If that is the case, your best choice is probably to reword things to avoid the issue.",

People would say this to others who were leaving on a long and perilous journey, wishing them success, but more importantly wishing for their return. Edited: Can it be used without invoking any nuance of religiosity ? Well guys, I did check the references and did find the explanations which ended up becoming the answer for the question. What I meant was to get an educated opinion on the usage of the term in modern times. How a question with so many votes gets put on hold is beyond me. \nAnswer: \"God speed you\" is an example of a term with religious origins. Whether that makes it a \"religious term\" depends on what your definition of a \"religious term\" is. It's pretty archaic now. Perhaps surprisingly, it's not (originally) wishing \"speed\" to the person - it's from the old English word \"spede\" which means \"success\" (and from which \"speed\" is derived). So it's saying \"May god give success to you\". There are several phrases in common usage which have religious origins - often they now exist in a contracted form which isn't obviously recognisable as religious. For example, \"goodbye\", which is a contracted form of \"God be with you\". I think that most people wouldn't say that \"goodbye\" is a \"religious term\" (again, dependent on whatever that actually means), despite its religious origins. Because \"god speed you\" clearly contains the word \"god\", it's more likely to be described as religious, I would say.",

Email You can use email as an uncountable noun, just like mail. For example, \"I received lots of email today\" or \"John sends me too much stupid chain email\".

Originally, email was always uncountable, just like mail. But over time, largely due to the ubiquity of use, pieces of email or email messages (and similar phrases) were shortened, and simplified to just emails. For example: \"I have five emails\" or \"Kevin sends me too many emails\". (Contrast that last one with \"Kevin sends me too much email\".) Of course, you can still use emails in some contexts where email is also acceptable (\"I received lots of emails today\"), but it does have a slightly different meaning (compare to \"I received lots of email messages today\") because you are using a countable versus uncountable noun.",

Apparently, the word dates back to the early 16th century, so it shouldn't be considered slang (although, it is misused as slang for other reasons), but regardless of its vulgarity, could I use it in a formal context with its original definition? I imagine that people will be surprised, but when realizing in what context I am using it in, then it will be more understandable and acceptable to use it. Firstly, I do not even know the definition of the word due to its vastness in meaning, I always thought it was an exclamation-like word meaning nothing (for it to mean sexual activities is a slang definition, is that not correct?), but used purely for emphasis. What does it first and foremost mean in its original/accurate and/or formal definition? I also know of another definition of the word \"Fuck,\" which is \"I will fuck you\" as in \"I will defeat you\" (in context of fighting or combat), is that a formal definition as well? I mainly ask for this, because I need to use the word in this context, specifically and especially. Also, side question, is it possible not to always make it a vulgar word? Thanks in advance. \nAnswer: Let's just go ahead and say, no. It's questionable to use expletives here, so... unless you're writing a dissertation on the usage of the word in question, again: no.

I have noticed that not is usually used with a verb, but I think that there sometimes are exceptions although I can't think of one now. \nAnswer: Not is a negative adverb; no is a negative quantifier; non- is a negative prefix. Since negation is so important, thousands of idioms use each of these, among other negatives. Consequently there are lots of exceptions to the general rules below. Non- is not a word, but a part of another word, usually a descriptive adjective: non-lethal, non-professional, non-native, non-technical, non-playing (The hyphen is optional.) Each of these mean \"anything but ...\" -- anything that doesn't kill you is non-lethal, anything that's not technical is non-technical, etc. This meaning contrasts with un- and in-, which refer to opposites instead of complements. No is half of the answer pair Yes/No, shading off vocally into Nah, Nuh-uh, and Uh-uh. But it can also quantify and negate any noun phrase: Some blade of grass ~ No blade of grass; One who saw it ~ No one who saw it. Not is the general negator for verb phrases, including predicate adjectives and nouns. In a verb phrase, not occurs immediately after the first auxiliary verb. If there is no auxiliary verb in the verb phrase, Do-Support supplies a form of do. Not is contracted whenever possible, with auxiliaries or subjects (especially pronouns): He's not interested ~ He isn't interested; She doesn't like it, but not *She not likes it. Any of these negatives (and many others) can negate a sentence, changing its truth value. It's easy to switch between them, too; the sentences below all mean the same thing: They allowed no phone calls. They didn't allow phone calls. No one allowed phone calls. Phone calls weren't allowed.",

In those days, if a rancher or farmer had trouble with wild animals attacking his livelihood, his first recourse would be to shoot the offending animal. If claim jumpers were bothering (troubling) miners, they got shot. If some patron caused trouble in a bar, he got shot. Even the Indians of the day were prone to pull down telegraph wires that the White Man put up across their territory.

To be inept: I suck at math. see TFD The fixed-phrase \"this/that SUCKS dick/cock\" gained currency exclusively among male American youth in the early 1970's as a derogatory slang expression of general contempt for some object, activity, or person. The phrase was, as intended, unapologetically misogynistic and homophobic. In the seventies, female youth never employed this idiom. No surprise there, though this is no longer the case. By the late seventies, probably in order to evade adult censure (and since youth knew precisely what was intended), the last word of the phrase was dropped.

In most cases where a person may become king, there is only one king in the political structure he inhabits. For instance, if he is in the line of succession for the English throne, he probably cannot become king of France or Denmark without marrying into that royal family. The equivalent phrase to \"I can't wait to be king\" would use a definite article - it could be rephrased as \"I can't wait to be the king\", since there is only one kingship he is eligible to accede to.",

            "input": "Question: Upon answering the telephone, the person calling asks if Joan is available. If Joan is the person who answered the phone, should she say \"This is her\" or \"This is she\"? \nAnswer: Traditional grammarians prefer the nominative (\"she\") for the complement of the verb \"to be\". Most usage in my experience prefers the accusative (\"her\") and regards the verb as having a direct object rather than a complement. I suspect the traditional grammarians, as they often did, have misapplied a rule of Latin grammar. In Latin, \"esse\" takes a complement in the nominative case, but Latin declines the verb strongly enough that it doesn't bother with a pronoun as the subject of a verb unless needed for emphasis. \"It is she\" in Latin would be \"illa id est\", which looks far more natural than the English. Note that it's \"c'est lui\" in French, so there isn't a general rule for a complement of \"to be\" being in the nominative. Explanation: A normal (transitive) verb, like say \"have\" has a direct object, which is in the accusative case. So, for example, \"I have her\" uses \"her\" as a direct object, and \"her\" is in the accusative case, where \"she\" is in the nominative case. In Latin, the verb \"esse\" (\"to be\") is special; it doesn't have a direct object in the accusative case, it has a complement in the nominative case. English grammarians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries adopted a number of rules of Latin grammar into English; this was one of them. In Latin, \"it is she\" and \"she is it\" are both the same thing \"id illa est\" or \"illa id est\" can both be translated either way - the point being that the \"is\" (\"est\") just equates to things to each other - it's like in maths you can have x=y or y=x and they both mean the same thing. English, though, takes word-order very seriously, and a pronoun after a verb is very strongly marked as being in the objective case and you don't get the benefit that you get in Latin from the exception - there's still one before the verb and one after; you don't get to make clear that it's commutative. So you have a special-case for a verb, which you get no useful benefit from. It's hardly surprising that most English speakers have reverted to \"it is her\" rather than \"it is she\". A note on cases: Latin is conventionally described as having seven cases (though only five are actually different for most nouns and pronouns). It has two cases, accusative and dative for the objects of verbs. English's residual case system only has the one case for both, which merge into the objective case (in fact, a third Latin case, ablative, merges in too). That's why the two paragraphs above appear to use two different words for the same case.",

However, all of the examples you give seem to me to be forced, and to shout out loud \"Hey, look at how sensitive I'm being!

Kris would like some more.

Is there some kind of rule about this? \nAnswer: I think your essential concern is about countable vs. uncountable nouns. Countable nouns can be singular or plural; uncountable nouns are singular. Some words can be both, in different meanings. Take a look at this example discussing countable and uncountable nouns: The coffees I prefer are Arabica and Brazilian.

Googling shows persistence: Firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition. perseverance: Steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success.

For example: The telemarketers persistently called us. We don't say they \"perseverantly\" called us. \"Persistent\" is used when there continuing action, and the purpose is either bad, or neutral, and sometimes(rarely) good. \"Perseverance\", is used when the purpose is good. That is, you're doing something to help someone, or to achieve a desirable goal, such as climbing Mt. Everest. Depending on how you feel on something, you could use \"perseverance\"/\"Persistence\". For example, the telemarketer calling you, could annoy you, and you could call him \"obstinately persistent\". But to the marketer, you might be to him, a tough customer, and he might seem to himself \"bravely perseverant in trying to persuade this tough customer.\" As you can see, it gives a different \"feel\" about the thing described.",

I also get annoyed when I see this phrase, especially from people who should know better. At one of my old jobs year ago, I worked with an account manager who actually used that phrase in an e-mail, saying something like \"I should of known better\". Yes, an account manager \"should of\" had a better education to know proper grammar... or at least know that's not a phrase used by professionals. Even though the phrase might be pronounced and heard as \"should of\" (or \"would of\" or \"could of\"), there's no such phrase in written English. No school that I've heard of teaches this phrase and basic rules of grammar \"abbreviate the word have as 've\". And writing \"should of\" takes just as many characters to write as \"should've\", so it's not like it's text-speak. In my opinion, it's people being stupid, ignorant, or trying to be funny/ hip/ trendy by using the wrong phrase. Then other people see it and want to be in on the joke, so they use it also.",

(I know feels strange is not very helpful, but I'd like to know how to convey the meaning in the most natural way.) \nAnswer: Penultimate is a regular word in the normal register in Portuguese or Spanish: penultimo. In English, however, it becomes a much more educated word belonging to a much more learned, or elevated, register. Therefore to translate to English and keep to the same register, you must select the more pedestrian next-to-last. (Then again, if we were linguists talking about syllable stress, we would not be afraid to use this word. It just isn't a blue-collar world; it's a professional one.) It's like asking whether you can translate PT/ES cotidiano to EN quotidian. Yes, you can, but you shouldn't, because you've crossed register boundaries, which means it doesn't sound equivalent even thought it means the same thing. Not always, but in general, when you find a word in English that's a close cognate with something from Romance, the register has switched, and you should look for a more Anglo-Saxon word if you want to keep to the same style. Because of the Norman occupation, Modern English often has pairs of words in different and contrasting registers, where a more purely Romance or purely Germanic language than English now is would have only one. This gives English more flexibility and nuance by having recourse to a pair of terms instead of having one alone.

Trans- and cross- are interchangeable in many cases. From Wikipedia (emphasis mine): In abbreviations, it can represent trans- (e.g. XMIT for 'transmit', XFER for 'transfer'), cross- (e.g. X-ing for 'crossing', XREF for 'cross-reference'), Christ- as shorthand for the labarum (e.g. Xmas for 'Christmas', Xian for 'Christian'), the crys- in 'crystal' (XTAL), or various words starting with ex- (e.g. XL for 'extra large', XOR for 'exclusive-or'). Example: a transatlantic flight is one that crosses the Atlantic, and something that is transdermal crosses through the skin. The trans- in transmit and transfer is analogous to transatlantic. Crossing a mit or a fer makes perfect sense. -Mit is from the Latin mittere which means to send. -Fer is from the Latin ferre which means to bear or carry. 'Transmit' often means to send across something or over a specific medium and 'transfer' can be to carry across from one to another. Therefore trans- is often replaced with X- in certain words.",

American Heritage Dictionary: n. pl. goes Collins Dictionary: n, pl goes Merriam-Webster Dictionary: plural goes Cambridge Dictionary: plural goes Random House Unabridged Dictionary (dictionary.com): plural goes Google NGram Viewer does not show any results for \"two gos at\" or \"two gos at\", but does when written as \"goes\". A Google search shows the following results: \"two gos at\" = 453 results. \"two goes at\" = 19,500 results. \"three gos at\" = 252 results. \"three goes at\" = 20,200 results. Note that both Google search and Ngram Viewer may show false positives, as Google search, as far as I know, doesn't take punctuation into account when giving search results, ie., full stops, commas. But I think it's safe to assume the consensus is that the plural of go (attempt or try) is \"goes\". I think this is a good question, as somewhere in my head I have an instinct to write it \"gos\". However the answer is gotten easily by checking some dictionaries. Also, if you wrote \"I had three gos at it before giving up\", I have a feeling the typical reader probably wouldn't even be surprised by it or notice it particularly as wrong. This is just my opinion. I have this feeling because the \"-os\"/\"-oes\" plural ending rules are wildly inconsistent. Potatoes, tomatoes and heroes are correct. But \"photos\" and \"burritos\" are correct. However most dictionaries seem to list either \"-os\" or \"-oes\" ending as acceptable in \"ghetto\" and \"mosquito\". Both \"mosquito\" and \"burrito\" most likely come from Spanish, yet most dictionaries say only \"mosquito\" can have plural ending either \"-os\" or \"oes\", whereas they're consistent in listing \"-os\" for burrito plural. Same goes for \"canto\", \"manifesto\" and \"grotto\". These words most likely come from Italian, yet the plural of \"canto\" is \"cantos\", whereas the dictionaries say the plural of \"grotto\" or \"manifesto\" can end in either \"-os\" or \"-oes\". Addendum As some people have claimed that the rules for -os or -oes plural endings are quite consistent (and I happen to disagree), I've included more examples to show just how unpredictable this can get. The claim generally is basically that borrowed words or imported words from other languages have -os as their endings and most everything else has -oes. The more specific claim is this rule applies for words from Romance languages specifically. embargo (Spanish): Dictionaries show only -oes plural. NGrams show -oes much more common. tornado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes much more common. desperado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes more common. cargo (Spanish) plural possibly as the pants: Dictionaries show either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes more common. mango (Portuguese): Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. domino (uncertain exactly which language, but a Romance one, or maybe directly from Latin): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. volcano (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. motto (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes to be more common. Words taken directly from Latin many times have -oes plural ending, but not always: veto has plural vetoes torpedo has plural torpedoes However memento overwhelmingly has plural mementos. And embryo is always embryos. Echo, directly from Greek, has plural \"echoes\". hello (native English): Nearly always \"hellos\". no (native English): Much more common as \"nos\", ie., \"yeses and nos\". do (native English): Dictionaries give plural as either \"dos\" or \"do's\". The results for searches of these terms would be confounding to say the least. weirdo (native English): some dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os is much more popular Unknown origin: hobo: Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams show roughly same frequency. gizmo: = Dictionaries only give -os, \"gizmoes\" doesn't show anything in NGrams. gazebo: Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os more common.

How do you refer properly to the coming weekend, \"This weekend\" or \"Next weekend\"? I believe that using \"next weekend\" would refer to the 13th & 14th and \"this weekend\" would refer to this week's end. Technically the coming weekend (6th & 7th) would be the next weekend on the calendar. So which is correct? I'm hoping for a definitive answer with backing since this is an argument over opinion. \nAnswer: The issue isn't as definitive as you might think. Ultimately, it comes down to what interpretation of \"next\" you consider to be correct. For example, the American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed) defines 'next' simply as Immediately following, as in time, order, or sequence Following this definition, \"next weekend\" will always mean the weekend with the start date in closes proximity in time. If the phrase is used during a weekend, of course, you'd be referring to the weekend following the one you are currently experiencing. However, the issue gets more complicated if you look to other definitions. The Oxford American Dictionary has a specific definition for 'next' when used in the context of time: (of a day of the week) nearest (or the nearest but one) after the present : not this Wednesday, next Wednesday Here, we're given the choice: it can either mean the weekend with the closest start date, or the following one (as specified by the parenthetical addition or the nearest but one). This definition has come about mostly because of usage development. Many words and phrases in the english dictionary have meanings contrary to their technical definitions, and yet are still used commonly and considered valid. Thus, while technically \"next\" implies immediate sequence, it is used in other ways (which dictionaries like the OAD have accommodated for validity), so it's really a matter of personal preference. For example, it is unlikely that I will even use the phrase \"next weekend\" during the week, because some people might be confused as to what I am referring to. Instead, I will say \"this weekend,\" unless it is currently the weekend, in which case I will say \"next weekend.\".",

[misguided attempt at gender neutrality] \"Everybody has at least three dollars in their wallet.\" Everybody is singular in number, which is why we do not say, \"Everybody are going to the movies.\" [how I would do it] \"Everybody has at least three dollars in its wallet.\" Gender is forced to neuter using an already-existing pronoun, and singular number is preserved.

For example, I might record a meeting with a tape recorder, or have a tape recording of a phone message on my answering machine. When digital recording started to become affordable and mainstream, the word digital was added to indicate that digital techniques were being used instead of the default analog (and of course for marketing reasons.) \"Hey check out my new digital voice recorder, I can record a whole day of classes without having to change a tape!\" Fast forward to today, and digital recording is standard, while analog is the unusual special case.

If the next word does not start a new sentence, because the question mark is part of a quotation, a title, an interruption, etc., then it is not capitalized. Usually such things are set off with quotes, dashes, parentheses, or italics; but not always.

I think that it's grammatically incorrect, and here is my reasoning: All of the tigers have spots. All of us are here. None of us are dead yet. The three examples all sound correct when using the plural \"are\", rather than \"is\". Question Unfortunately, some of my coworkers disagree with me. They believe that the quote is correct when it uses the word \"is\". So my question is this: Is the motivational quote grammatically correct or should it say \"all\"? \nAnswer: Semantically, none is neither singular nor plural. It's less than one and much less than many. So its subject agreement is entirely arbitrary. Plus, negatives are noted for their funny grammar. Positive quantifiers are either singular in verb agreement, like each and every, or plural, like all. None can be either, depending on context. Every boy is playing today. Every one of the boys is playing today. Each boy is playing today. Each of the boys is playing today. All of the boys are playing today. None of them are playing today. None of them is armed. If it quantifies a plural noun phrase, as in none of us, then it's equivalent to the negation of a universal quantifier in many cases. For instance, None of us are going to the party. is equivalent to All of us are not going to the party. which is ambiguous; that's one reason not to say it this way. instead of All of us are staying away from the party. which is unequivocally plural. As for the motivational slogan None of us is as smart as all of us (note, no full stop) It's intended to make you think, and it seems to have succeeded. If you like, you can take it as short for None of us is as smart as all of us together are. which is meant to contrast individual intelligence with groupthink, and therefore is unequivocally singular. tl;dr It'd be grammatical with are, but it'd also be a less efficient slogan.",

Can you give me a reference on such a rule? \nAnswer: Plural nouns with the definite article are, well, definite. Consider Cats don't like me. versus The cats don't like me. The former implies every cat on Earth doesn't like me; the latter, that some (contextually obvious) specific group of cats don't like me. ADDED In my opinion, yes, unmemorize that reference in your other question and memorize the following: use the definite article with a plural only to denote a known or stated subset of the class (\"The elephants [in this zoo] are dangerous\"); omit the article for the whole class (\"Elephants [all of them] are dangerous\"). Use an indefinite article with a singular to denote the whole class when you want to emphasize the singular nature (\"A glass of wine is healthy, but two can lead to dissolution.\") Use the definite article with a singular when referring to a specific instance or when you need, for some reason, to sound like Sir David Attenborough in a BBC nature documentary (\"The elephant is a regal creature, reigning over his home, the savanna ...\"). Of course, an indefinite article with a plural (\"An elephants are dangerous\") and omitting articles with the singular of a countable noun (\"Elephant is dangerous\") are both just wrong, wrong, wrong. Edit Two years later and I realize another rule: \"the\" is used to mark adjectives that have been promoted to nouns. When Paul Revere said, \"The British are coming\", he was referring to the British 10th Regiment of Foot, not to every subject of King George, so the \"the\" was de rigeur under the above rule. However, when Quentin Crisp wrote, \"The British do not expect happiness,\" he did mean every single Briton. The \"the\" is only necessary to make it clear that the word \"British\" is being used as a noun. With an ordinary noun, it would be different. \"Plumbers [all plumbers] do not expect happiness\" but \"The plumbers [in London] do not expect happiness.\" Compare Jacques Brel's lyric, \"The naked and the dead should hold each others' hands\" with Dean Wormer's line, \"Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life.\" \"Naked\" and \"dead\" are nouns (or adjectives being used as nouns); \"fat\", \"drunk\", and \"stupid\" are adjectives, which is why he uses \"is\" instead of \"are\": the subject of the verb is \"no way\".",

This Friday is the Friday at the end of this week. I have a Canadian friend, however, who enforces the more literal meaning of next Friday the Friday that comes next. Is there a correct meaning for next Friday, or does this entirely depend on cultural differences? \nAnswer: People generally understand next Friday as the Friday after this, that is, if you are on a Thursday, and someone tells you to meet him next Friday, it doesn't mean the next day, but rather, Friday week, the Friday after. Some pedantics will believe and argue that it is, as you say, the Friday that comes next. That is valid reasoning. However, if you want to be understood by the majority, \"next Friday\" will mean Friday next week. So, in order to mean the Friday that actually comes next, you would say this Friday, but next Friday is generally understood by more people to mean the Friday after this.",

The article referenced a female senator so-and-so. However, I think that senator, with the -or ending is in the nominative, third declension, which is not gender neutral. So, when referring to a female subject, should senatrix be used instead? Also, does anyone know if there is a reason why the male form is used exclusively? I think females were restricted from the Roman senate perhaps the term just never made sense etymologically because of this? \nAnswer: The same issue comes up in the word *senile,*and although anile is an English word, it is seldom used. As for the suffix trix, it clings to life in geometry, where a parabola is defined as the locus of points equidistant from a point p and a line L called the directrix. Perhaps one could argue that \"directrix\" is just a Latin word. I don't think so.",
