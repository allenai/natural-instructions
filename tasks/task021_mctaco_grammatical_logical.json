        "A question that is free of any grammatical or logcal errors, should be labeled 'yes', otherwise it should be indicated as 'no'. A question is grammatically correct if all its entities i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, adverbs are at appropriate position. A question is logically correct if the semantic makes sense."
