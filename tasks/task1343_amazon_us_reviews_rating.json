I also wanted secure but accessible pockets for passports, etc.  Since I'd have it with me pretty constantly it also had to be comfortable.  Lastly, while roomy, it needed to fit under airplane seats.  ALL of theses conditions were met with flying colors!  It also turned out the build quality was excellent.  Oh, one last positive.  The backpack easily \\\\\"butterflies\\\\\" open at airport security, and very quickly comes back together after the scan.  The fact that it laid flat in the scan prevented me from delays.

So when I saw this wireless keyboard for $20, with the HP logo on it, the first thought that crossed my mind was \\\\\"cheap, practical, and not fancy.\\\\\" Which is perfect for me. Sadly, to my surprise, while cheap (and definitely not fancy) the HP Multimedia Wireless Keyboard is anything but practical.    To be fair, the wireless mouse works very well in my setup,in which the receiver is literally on the same table as the wireless mouse / keyboard combo. It is responsive, and feels ergonomic enough for me to sit with for hours. However, as soon as I began typing away on the keyboard, I knew there would be issues. In the 8 letter title for this review, the keyboard did not register 12 keystrokes, which meant that I had to go back 12 times and slowly retype each letter, or insert each space that was missed. After reading the reviews (WHY didn't I do this before?) I thought it might simply be due to the limited range on the receiver; no luck, the receiver is literally sitting next to my keyboard, with no improvement.    The keyboard responsiveness of this product is reminiscent to the old electric typewriter days, in which certain keys would just not work, or would get stuck. I will sadly  be returning this product today, leading to more money wasted towards this waste of a product.",

Play station 3- after finding a channel on the router that PS3 \\\\\"likes\\\\\" this router did pretty well staying connected with a PS3 upstairs. (router was downstairs) Although two weeks of connectivity would be dampened by a few days of non connection...but once again SSID is found no problem.    3. Wii- forget it. SSID found...1% connectivity. I only got it to connect twice over several months.     4. Nintendo DS- it worked pretty well with these and it seemed to stay connected.    6. HP Photo smart wireless printing- stayed connected once connected, but took forever to connect. Once again SSID found with some problems...but even after found, will not connect until you mess with channel after channel to find the right one.     9. Bluray LG BD-390- Router gives 50% connectivity. Hit and miss. Some days would connect and I could stream Netflix, other days would not. SSID found about 80% of the time...but connectivity 50%.    10. Desktop computer and apple macbook- no problems: never lost connection.    NOTE: The signal was not that bad...several green bars on all of this gear.    To sum it up I had about a 90% success rate at discovering the SSID, but far less than 50% connectivity...This router was an absolute waste of money. It just would not connect.  Amazingly enough I received the verizon FIOS wireless router, hooked it up and secured it in 5 minutes, and within 15 minutes had everything running wirelessly...SSID and connectivity on all of the above.

I think either the DIN-to-USB interface didn't work, or it was incompatible with Windows 2000 or something.<br /><br />Anyway, I was hopeful when I found this trackball, but it was too exspensive. Lately on sale for around $[...] after rebate, I bought one.<br /><br />Installation went smoothly, but that was the last \\\\\"smooth\\\\\" thing about it. The scroll ring jumps along in about 1/4\\\\\" increments, making it unusable. There's no way to adjust the pointer variables to allow smooth tiny increments and speedy large ones. The toggle to slow down the pointer movement doesn't work when using the pointer on the scroll bar. The list goes on and on. If you unplug from one USB port and plug into another, all your settings disappear, but that may be as designed.<br /><br />It may be a software issue -- the old Mouseworks package has been replaced with TrackballWorks, now at V1.0.4. I can't find anything like the Preferences XML file that you could tweak with Mouseworks, but there may be something in the Registry.<br /><br />All in all very disappointing. Back it goes.<br /><br />Update: Back it went, replaced with a new one by Kensington. The new one wasn't any better, and Kensington support said that was as good as it was going to get.

At first the drive worked very well: it supported plug-and-play, had a large amount of space, was competitively priced and was made by WD, a brand I thought to be trustworthy. <br /> <br />However, a company who boasts for you to \\\\\"Put Your Life On It\\\\\" (their external hard drives) should at least try to ensure data reliability & take accountability for their products. When I called customer service about my failed drive I obtained this list of information: <br /> <br />1. If you wish to recover your data, you must use one of their partners or risk voiding your warranty. There are only 8 in North America. <br />2. You are responsible for the cost incurred in using their data recovery partners. <br />3. Western Digital doesn't issue any refunds. If you purchased your drive from a store such as BestBuy you could return your faulty product. However, at online retailers such as Buy.com you are left without options. <br />4. You can obtain a replacement drive (what they call re-certified) but it'll be devoid of your precious data.  <br />5. You are responsible for the shipping costs associated with returning the faulty drive back to WD. They pay for shipping of the replacement drive to you. This is apparently called \\\\\"fair shipping\\\\\". <br />6. According to the CSR, Western Digital is not responsible for your data. They are only a supplier of hard drives. <br />7. On a different note, the CSR never actually apologized for my failed drive but only used words such as \\\\\"unfortunate\\\\\" and \\\\\"let's explore your options\\\\\".  <br /> <br />In summary, this product is fine if you happen to receive a unit that doesn't fail. However, I would not be willing to take that risk and I don't recommend anyone buying this product for any amount of money. It's acceptable that a device such as this is prone to failure.

They aren't enough to hinder any performance, but I can see the imperfections when the screen is off.

To get it to work, you can only use a Windows PC that has WiFi.  So, desktop PCs are out of luck.<br /><br />The funny thing is you need a Windows based PC with WiFi only to run their setup program.  After that, the device isn't actually designed for desktop PCs.  You can't stream content to Windows PCs, so why require one to use it?  By contrast, although it lacks the DVD drive, the Seagate Satellite lets you stream content right out of the box, with anything that can connect to it.<br /><br />I called Samsung twice and essentially was told they are still working out the kinks and had no way to help me.  They said they had some resources on their web site, including a PDF of the book (which is just a worthless sheet already in the box), and some videos.  I asked what the videos showed and he told me he's never seen them because Samsung doesn't allow their employees to stream videos, even when they are from their site.  So, essentially they don't train their staff at all and they can offer no advice.<br /><br />I can only assume that if they actually sell any of these, the buyers must be using something other than an iPad to play the content, because out of the box, it doesn't work.  The software, the setup programs and the instructions are poorly written and if you can get past that and complete the setup, it still doesn't work.<br /><br />I eventually found a work-around.  After reading online that their device has a DHCP server, that lets you use this as a router (assuming you plug your existing LAN into it), and that it often conflicts with other devices, I decided to try something before sending it back.  I changed the device to a static IP, and I picked a number in the 192 .68 .1 .9, then used 255 .255 .255 . 0 as the subnet and left everything else blank.  Viola... it worked, but how on earth would they expect anyone to figure that out?<br /><br />Let's hope they update the firmware and software again to make it right.

The 600x speed vs 300x speed makes no difference in 8GB Lexar CF cards that I use in matching Sony a700 DSLR's (e.g. five fps in bursts, but will slow down to one fps after 3 seconds, 14 frames total).  I think this is due to the cameras buffer not the card performance.  The Lexar 8GB 600x CF cards stay at the same capture rate as the 5 year old Lexar 8GB 300x CF cards, but that may be the 5 year old camera can not write at the faster speed.  Be sure to read the manual to determine the maximum card size your camera will take.  Most camera makers have pdf copies of the manuals available on their web site under \u201cSupport\u201d.  I have a 2007 Ricoh at work that will not read anything bigger than 2GB.  My 2013 Olympus will not read anything bigger than 64GB.  The camera\u2019s maximum data write speed may not be in the manual.  DSLR or Prosumer cameras can write to the card faster than lower priced cameras.  High-speed cards (e.g. 600x or Class 10 for this Lexar) will work in slower cameras, but they will only store data as fast as the camera can push it.",

Simple solution: a two inch strip of electric tape completely masks the annoyance.    Now for the good: I have several wireless devices, and this one works uninterrupted from over 40 feet away through walls! Unless you have a huge projector screen, and are sitting further away than that, this keyboard appears to have no connectivity issues that often plague other wireless gadgets.    The feel, weight, profile, etc. of the keyboard is excellent. It appears to have fairly sturdy construction, and the keys depress effortlessly from their slim stature.    A few minor considerations: it does not have backlighting, so any midnight World of Warcraft rampage will require a secondary light source. It also has no indication for NUM/SCROLL/CAPS lock. It hasn't been an issue for me (I only use NUM lock, and it's always on).    I would highly recommend this product to anyone.

Its not too small nor too big and has enough space to keep your digicam or your ipod or even your cell phone.<br /><br />The back zipper is very nicely padded with high quality materials and it can easily fit your 15.6'' laptop and can keep it very safe and protected as well.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this is high quality product and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a neat looking backpack that is superb in the build quality.",

I sent the machine back to the company and they returned it.  They still didn't work.  I've been on the phone numerous times the the support techs.  They say they will call back and then don't.  First person I talked with was a Michael Cooley.  He didn't get back to me after a very long time, so when I finally called back I found out he was no longer working there.  Then I spoke with a guy named Adam Hayes.  His last statement to me was &#34;I WILL call you back&#34;.  That was back in August of '14.  I'm still waiting the the blue USB ports still do not work.

I returned it to the third party seller, because it was clunky, had some wear and tear (the paint job was chipped and worn-out in severel spots), came in oily (believe it or not), and there were a lot of other lighter, more ergonomical wireless keyboard choices on the market that were cheaper and a lot more attractive (with more features and capabilities)!  The springs on some of the keyboard buttons did not work (were damaged) or were worn out, aswell.  I had to go through my credit card agency just to issue a refund (something I definetly did not want to resort to, and something that will definely cause certain people not to get their monitary funds returned).  I'm embarrassed to say I spent 100$ for(by far) the cheapiest one.  Not only was the package highly mis-represented, this product, just does not work in so many ways!  I would recommend buying this product, used, for as little as 5$, no more...new 10$ max.  Even then, you would still be  a little upset about it (no joke).  You'll be asking yourself, \\\\\"where did my 5 to 10 dollars go!\\\\\"?  You could easily take a trip over to Best Buy and pick one out for under 50$ for which, you would be easily satisfied of...and not have to spend days waiting for your order to arrive via Amazon.com.  Moving on, the keys mounted on the keyboard are awkwardly placed so you have to re-learn how to type just to use them.  The word \\\\\"acuity\\\\\" and lack thereoff comes to mind when I think of this clunker as I'm scrolling and typing.  (As you can see I have nothing good to say about this product)  The lights are hard to look at (I would even say that they hurt your eyes when you look at them) and the Start Button is unnecessary and happens to be the center of the keyboard.  The package for return included all the items of the orginal order:  (1) wireless keyboard, (1) wireless mouse with wireless USB connector, (1) mouse charger, and a plug in cable.  Thank you for your time  .  The aforementioned takes care of the technical side of it(for return), now for the untechnical(after return):  Judging from the price tag and the pictures you see of this product you would think it would be made-up of some type of high quality metallic alloy or similar substance.......It's not!  It's made of some cheap, heavy, brittle plastic and is definately a quirky \\\\\"clunker.\\\\\"  Usually the heavier a substance is the more durable, this in an exception.  Even if this product were free, I still would not want it in my household.  My best guess is that all the other reviewers of this product live in the country some place and are very bored in their lives.  What is wrong with everyone?  The thing with Amazon is, they make all their profits based on the fact that there's a lot of sales and an even longer drawned-out return process that nobody wants to be a part of (-hence all sales are final?).  Therefore, for all intensive purposes, Amazon.com is 100% on the seller's side during the return process.  They even \\\\\"fine tune\\\\\" the negative feedbacks on the customer reviews section of their products in many different ways (something many other large companies with websites and opinions, that we all hear good things from, frequently do and are guilty, but we never hear of).  So what is with these \\\\\"reviewers\\\\\" and why do I know they'll come crying to me at some point in the future saying how \\\\\"unfair\\\\\" it all was.  Do not be fooled, many other big media and Newspaper websites monitor and do this too (-Not to put Amazon.com in a seemingly altruistic bubble).  The only \\\\\"guarantee\\\\\" websites and media makes is who \\\\\"controls\\\\\" it.  The only \\\\\"guarantee\\\\\" Amazon makes is that this product will be a huge waste of your time.  They'll even use the fact that there's only positive reviews viewable against you in the claim process...That's assuming that you have all your ducks in a row and are still ableto return the product.  Now let's go into detail about the return process.  They do absolutely nothing in the return process for you.  Proof of this after chatting with 8 different associates (they'll send you to India) and sending a plethera of \\\\\"maniditory\\\\\" and unmanditory emails that never get returned.  If you don't compleately see that they like to \\\\\"scapegoat\\\\\" a company that does not technically exist in the first place by sending you to India (something I think should definelty be illegal), YOU ARE A FOOL!!! ............But........were're expected to return all their emails immediately and/or according to their time frame, or the process gets cancelled?  -They'll even say corporations are individuals??  Btw, all of those emails and chats were necessary to send or it works against you in the \\\\\"claim\\\\\" process.  It gets better and better.  All this would be avoidable if Amazon took the time to review their products, but then again, corporations are indivduals??  This product should not be the most expensive, in closing.  IN THE LONG RUN,...DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH AMAZON.COM (THERE'RE FAKE)!!!",

You will also need a program for the formatting since the drive is greater than 32 gb, I recommend using Easeus partition master home edition to do so. Anyway once your ps3 recognizes the drive it'll format on its own. This drive worked very well and was a good price for all the space left on it.

Samsung tech support was not helpful about it and claimed that the stand issue was my problem.   I read on some obscure forum that some guy got his to fit by having it upside down on his bed as he forced it in by putting all his body weight into it. I tried it and it popped in. I finally was able to use it.     Fast forward 3 months later, the monitor just went to a black screen and no matter what I tried, it won't show anything other than black. I rma'd the monitor, shipped it back. they claimed they did a repair on it and shipped it back. I open the box to find the same issue. I swear all they did was wait a week, put it back in another box and shipped it back. I did another rma, shipped it to them, they claimed they did a repair and sent it back, same issue.     I am currently on hold with \\\\\"customer relations department\\\\\" to get them to just issue me a replacement. I've been on hold for 40 minutes now and still counting.     At this point, I would just say that samsung has gotten too big for their own good. I used to love their products, but now I wouldn't recommend any of their products to anyone. It's a good thing I waited on buying that samsung hdtv a few weeks ago...     EDIT: a follow up on this review - I was placed on hold with their customer relations department, they finally picked up around 6:50. I told her exactly what happened with this monitor, and how many times it was sent for repairs with no results. She said she will send another monitor and when I receive it, I can send back my old one. I said no problem, and she put me on hold. After about 5 minutes on hold, the phone hangs up. I tried to call back only to have the customer support person tell me that customer relations is closed now. After some arguing, he issued the exchange.     Today my monitor shipped and it's at home.

By February 2013, the battery held no charge and started to swell (just as the original had after 4 years of use.) Again, I would not buy this again knowing what I know now.<br /><br />Update for Dec 13, 2012: The battery turned out to be a piece of junk.  It started to go downhill after 2 months, and now only holds a 15 minute charge with no warning that it is low.  The computer just turns off.  I would recommend against purchasing this battery, even at a cheap price.<br /><br />[previous review]<br />First of all, the finish doesn't match the actual MacBook, as the black MacBook is matte, and the battery is shiny.  That's not a problem, since I have a leather cover for my computer.  I \\\\\"trained\\\\\" the battery for over 2 weeks, completely emptying it each time, and it still doesn't keep very accurate time. Again I can make do, but it's something to be aware of.  When it gets to about 20 minutes to go, you better either plug in or start saving everything that you don't want to lose.<br /><br />I read a few reviews where people are claiming 4 hours on a charge.  I wasn't so lucky.  On the lowest screen brightness setting, I can probably get about 2.5 hours out of one charge.  I have had the battery for about a month now, so yeah, that's as good as it's ever going to be with this one.  My original MacBook battery wasn't much better, so at least this one is cheap.  If it dies on me anytime soon, as in stops holding a charge, I'll update this review.  If you don't see anything below, my battery is still functioning the way it should.",

They are a touch too small and so the gap between keys is a bit large.  Notes: It takes some getting used to the button layout. The \\\\\"home\\\\\", \\\\\"end\\\\\", \\\\\"PgUp\\\\\" and \\\\\"PgDn\\\\\" keys are above the number keys and to the right of the function keys. After getting used to the key placement, it isn't really an issue. At first I was having problems with the keyboard missing keystrokes if I typed on it quickly. I had the wireless usb adapter plugged into a usb 2.0 port on the front of my computer. Those ports are known to be slow on some machines. I then placed it into a usb 3.0 port on the front (even though this isn't a usb 3.0 keyboard) and it works great now. If you don't have up front usb 3.0 ports, I would suggest using one of the ports on the back of the computer if you have any issues with it not keeping up with your typing speed.

I've had the AGPtek 9-inch Android 4.0 tablet PC for about a week. First I found that the \\\\\"user guide\\\\\" in the box was worse than useless. It was poorly printed on pages of tissue-thin paper about 2x3 inches and contained many screenshots that were totally black. The downloaded version had legible pictures but was generally of not much help. It even contained inconsistent advice, such as admonishing the user to use the USB connection only for the transmission of data, but then on another page pointing out that it could be used for faster recharging (than the ac adapter). For the uninitiated Android user, a brief introduction to Android software might have been helpful, or at least a link to an Android tutorial. The worst problem I encountered was the tablet's poor wi-fi performance. The tablet consistently indicated that the signal from my home wi-fi network was \\\\\"weak,\\\\\" and sometimes too weak for the tablet to download anything. This is in spite of the perfectly normal performance of my aging LG telephone, my also aging netbook computer, and my even more remotely located Roku box under the TV. The only way I could get the tablet to operate through a wi-fi connection was to position myself about three feet from the wireless router, and even then the AGPtek would only show one or two arc-shaped bars, still indicating a very weak signal. In contrast, a signal strength app I have installed on my phone shows a \\\\\"moderate\\\\\" to \\\\\"good\\\\\" signal strength throughout the house. I can only conclude that the wireless transmitter/receiver function of the tablet is defective in either its design or its manufacture. The battery holds a charge only for a couple of hours or so, probably as a consequence of the perceived low signal strength of my home network. (The tablet probably ramps up it's receiver gain to the max in an effort to receive a better signal, andin so doing runs the battery down quickly.) My advice is to pay more up front and get a tablet with a brand name you can trust. Don't buy the AGPtek tablet. One way or another, this one is going back. I should probably give only one star and not two because most of the uses I had in mind for this device were online ones. But I suppose it's still possible to do a few things off-line, and it's always possible that you could use your \\\\\"portable\\\\\" tablet tethered to the router or to a wired network outlet. But that's not the way I would prefer to use a tablet PC. I think I just talked myself into dropping the rating to one star (I hate it).",

One day, 2 white lines appeared from side to side of the screen, plus the same image is multiplied by 6 times in miniature, I call ASUS tech support and they say they cannot solve the problem before 10 business days, which causing a huge backlog and problems at work, how will that be?, I need it immediately.    Very attractive feature for many gamers like me, but I think it was a bad decision from ASUS, locate the i7 processor in the notebook without a good cooling system, and I've asked friends and they told me that what is causing the problem overheating of the motherboard and video card.    The only solution I could find was that Amazon gave me a refund of money and buy another type of computer, to stay in better shape under these circumstances. But I prefer that they send me another new computer.    This was a great lesson I learned, to view or search for benchmarking of the computer and how the processor works and the different components together, both warming and performance.    Think before buying this computer!!!    First Update:  I have this computer for 4 months ago, and it's surprised me that I can't use my touchpad, namely it's screwed, don't function and that is a very big problem. I recount my problems: first the right button came bad (I can live with this), second the overheating when I use the high performance mode (almost 90\u00b0C, 194\u00b0F) only with MS Word and my browser opened (I try to don't use this mode of course), and now, the touchpad stopped to function, that's the last one of my disgrace (now I have to carry a mouse with me all the time to use the computer).  I am a student, and I can't spend money in another computer.  This was one of my worst decisions, only because I was attracted for the intel core i7.  Another problem for my is the support center, they said that spend like 3 weeks in know the problem and notify me if they have the specific components to fix the computer. I work in my laptop almost 24/7, how do I live without it?   Again, think about buy this computer. With my experience I prefer buy another than have less hardware but that works perfectly or about least 3 years, no 3 months.",

The action of the keys is ok, it is very sturdy and heavy, and the actions of the keys (while they last) is pretty good.  The back lighting is phenomenal, and the color choices are nice, although I must say I only use the blue.    Now, on to the bad news.  In home use, NOT OFFICE, HOME use, the keyboard lasted about two weeks before the action on the keys started becoming squeaky and spongy, and the space bar became very loose.  After another month, the faces of the keys started wearing off, and unless you are a touch typist (who is these days?) it is very hard to figure out what key you are pressing, as the paint wears off very quickly.    Amazon refused to do anything about it since it was beyond their 30 day window (even for a prime customer who spends several thousand dollars a year.. but oh well...)So  after a day or two of google searches I finally found Saitek's website, and submitted a warranty claim.  After a few weeks I got a reply and an RMA, and asked to ship the keyboard for possible repair.  I shipped it to them, in the box that it was originally packaged in, and waited.  Several weeks later, I came home to find (happily I thouhgt) my keyboard, repaired or replaced.. asd was eager to go.      To my horror I found that the keyboard had been returned to me, no paperwork, no repairs had been done, and thrown in the bottom of the shipping box with one small piece of brown paper as packaging.  Several of the key caps were missing now altogether, and the keyboard was chipped on the edge.  So it is now a worthless hunk of junk.  Saitek as not returned any of my emails or inquiries, and I have no expectations that they will.    If you are rich, and can buy one of there a month, and throw it away when it becomes unusable, then its a great value.  it really is superb right out of the box, but with total lack of service and support, and the short life span of the keyboard.... Just not worth buying.  i hope this helps.",

Their second message was asking if I'd clicked the mouse. I don't want to ding them unnecessarily, but of course I clicked the mouse.

I tested several games, Asphalt 8, a graphically intense racing game, and Drastic emulator running Pokemon Black, very taxing on the cpu. Asphalt 8 ran well, indicating strong performance, and Drastic rarely lags, although I expected much more: emulators are HUGELY taxing on a system.<br /><br />The physical design is nice, although I wish the micro USB port was on the bottom. Screen is good and performs well for its outdated technology. Don't expect the screen of a Galaxy S2+ product.

However, it is a strong speaker of remarkable quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give this tablet a 9.5/10, simply because the power button next to micro USB causes some problems.

The first failure cost $3,000 to get the data recovered.  Unfortunately I was also using it for data overflow at the time.<br /><br />The second (This model One Touch III) also died about a year after I purchased it.  Fortunately I was using only for backup.<br /><br />They run great out-of-the-box, but after a year they wither and die.  Why?  I am not sure if it's the incremental file-backup software, or the hardware.  Perhaps it is a combination of both, as Maxtor's incremental file-backup software progressively causes slower and slower operation, and more and more drive utilization.<br /><br />Google the words \\\\\"Maxtor repair\\\\\".  There are many vendors.  And with most, once they have your drive, it's usually the most expensive thing that needs to be repaired, typically requiring rebuilding the physical electronics.<br /><br />And considering the proprietary nature of Maxtor's drivers I don't find this price surprising.<br /><br />Final point: You cannot recover your system if you suffer a complete crash.  Expect to reinstall Windows, Office, get updates, and enter licenses, etcetera.  You can recover your files, yes, if your unit is still running.<br /><br />THE SOLUTION:  Get a reliable high capacity internal or external bare bones hard drive, and use image backup software, not file backup software.  There's a fundamental difference between \\\\\"file\\\\\" and \\\\\"image\\\\\" backups.<br /><br />I had several misconceptions about image backup software.  But I discovered one can also recover individual files.  And MORE importantly, you can recover your entire system as well - very simply from the backup drive.  It runs faster, it does a form of incremental backup based on image changes, and is much more reliable.  It is rare that a solution is both cheaper and better.  And I was not looking for cheaper.<br /><br />For a hard drive I use a WD 1T Sata.  And my software is ShadowProtect desktop.  I am sure there are others.<br /><br />By the way, with this solution, you own the software, so it's not tied to some device that will fail.  I also (once a month) do a one shot backup to my inexpensive Western Digital Passport.  Again as I own the software, I can apply it to any number of different physical backup devices that do not carry the extra overhead cost of proprietary software and hardware.<br /><br />EXTRA: In addition, you might want to also consider iDrive, or Carbonite.  I would use them for your documents only.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Unfortunately only those that have experienced the loss of work-related or financial data, family pictures, or even that report that your child wrote of which you are most proud, will appreciate the advantage of being prepared.<br /><br />Then to compound the problem, once we have experienced loss, we start out by looking for a simple solution.

Although the screen is large, the resolution is less than many 15&quot; screens. The keyboard feels nice, but it simply quit working after about 4 months of lower-than-average use. In addition, wireless networking died. When I took the machine to a Toshiba-authorized repair center, they replaced the motherboard and keyboard, but put the (previously working) mousepad in upside down and never got it to work again. After three weeks, I demanded my computer back. Three weeks after that, the keyboard died again. I took the machine to a different repair shop. They replaced the motherboard again, but the machine only lasted another couple of weeks before the keyboard went again. This time, I wiped the hard drive to eliminate any unseen driver conflicts. Unfortunately, the repair disks that Toshiba sent me were bad and, after 1/2 hour of babysitting a system install, I discovered the machine wouldn't boot at all. Toshiba made me pay $10 for another set of boot disks, then shipped them to the wrong address. Two weeks later, I got them and reinstalled the system, took the machine back to the repairshop, and had the keyboard itself replaced.  At least this time, they figured out the mouse pad.  After just a week now, the keyboard is again dead. (I'm writing this on a Mac.) Do not buy this machine. I'm looking at four repair tickets on a machine that frankly gets light use. And did I mention that Toshiba support is chiefly stonewalling? Two months of non-productivity from a machine I bought for work. The 1955 a lemon. Shame on Toshiba for deceiving consumers with it. Shame on magazine reviewers for blindly reciting specs without noting the many, many unhapy user reports like this one.",

I have the drives set to mirror so that I only have 3TB of total storage, but I have two copies of everything so if one drive dies on me, I simply swap it out, the DS212j rebuilds it, and I haven't lost any data.  Here's a list of all the features I use and love. Don't think of this thing as purely a NAS. It's a fully functional storage server running a Linux framework.<br /><br />-It has a gigabit ethernet port which is essential if you'll be streaming to multiple computers and TVs simultaneously.<br />-It has a built-in DLNA server which can stream so any DLNA compliant Blu Ray players, TVs, and computers in your home.<br />-Built-in mail server if you want to manage your email storage and distribution from within your home/office<br />-photo management: once you've moved all your photos to the DS212j, it'll serve them up to any apple product running their iOS app, or to any computer, or via DLNA.<br />-built-in torrent client that can be managed over iOS. On the road and just thought of something you'd like to download? No problem. Grab your iPad or iPhone, run the app, add the download to your client, there you go! it'll start cranking away on the download without the need to involve/leave on 24/7 a computer.<br />-built-in iTunes server can serve up all your itunes music/movies/tv shows to multiple computers if you have multiple people that want to share the same collection in the house.<br />-two USB ports to aid in easy copying. friend coming over and they want to copy a bunch of your content? Plug their USB 3 drive directly into the DS212j, use a laptop or tablet to access the client management page on the 212j, start the copy process, and watch it move ahead at blazing speeds since it's not having to pass through a computer at any point.<br /><br />It'll do hundreds of other tasks but I just don't have the time to type them all out. This thing is a HUGE step up if you're upgrading from just a plain old NAS.",

We professionally produce instructional videos and mostly \\\\\"film\\\\\" onto SDHC cards and, while convenient, transferring the large files does take awhile at USB 2.0 speeds. We upgraded to USB 3.0 earlier in the year and have enjoyed the faster transfer speeds. This card reader allows us to take full advantage of the faster speeds and also supports a wide range of current and legacy card formats.<br /><br />Installing the reader on our Win 7 64-bit editing PC was very straight forward, just plugged it in to an open USB 3.0 port and it self installed in just a few seconds. I also tested it on my older Vista laptop and it worked just fine at USB 2.0 speeds (backwards compatible).<br /><br />The reader is fairly small, making it easy to keep in a laptop case or pants pocket, and has four slots that support SDXC*, SDHC*, SD*, CF*, High-Speed CF (UDMA), MS, M2, Micro SDXC, and Micro SD* (* Tested).<br /><br />This is a very easy choice for those needing a \\\\\"plug-n-play\\\\\" portable USB 3.0 card reader.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH<br /><br />Note: A review unit was provided by the manufacturer, but that in no way influences my rating or comments.",

Now, I am questioning if I ever want to give Microsoft my business again.<br /><br />AVOID WIN8. It is too great a departure from what windows is supposed to be, and Microsoft is using apple tactics. They are trying to trap their users and control every aspect of their electronic experience.<br /><br />I hope someone will develop an open platform that has quality features. The thing that made Windows great is it use to give you maximum freedom and choices. It gave you control and flexibility over your equipment. It was easy to use, and easy to figure out.<br /><br />Maybe Win 8 is easy too, but it is so different that you can't find your way around by using what you already know about Win7. You have to learn everything all over again. WASTE OF TIME!<br /><br />I do not reward stupidity, do you hear that Microsoft! You should have made a product that will make your users happy, not one that irritates them! I wasted almost a month on your lame OS, and I ended up returning it.

I activated SSH login and started looking around the share while logged into the Drobo.  I got &#34;Input/output error&#34; for a large number of files on the share.  Rebooting the Drobo didn't fix it and the Dashboard said everything was fine.  I was able to delete these files on the command line after a few tries but it's very likely that volume corruption persists.  Drobo tech support agreed when I contacted them and said I could press Control-Shift-P in the Dashboard to initiate a filesystem check.  It doesn't do anything.  A quick check on Google verifies that nobody found it to work.  Drobo tech support's recommendation now is to BUY A SECOND DROBO and copy everything to it, then back.  Seriously?  The Drobo 5N has defective software and the solution is to buy two of them?  Other than that it's decently fast.  UPDATE: I figured out how unmount the RAID and run e2fsck while logged into the 5N's Linux system.  The volume was definitely corrupted despite everything in the Dashboard saying it was fine.  Don't trust your Drobo.  UPDATE 2: Lots more file corruption even though the Dashboard says everything is healthy.

Tried to get connection with my wireless; this worked the first time okay. I loaded word and excell. Did some work played around and shut down. Next day booted it up and the same blackout and flicker started again. Then I could'nt get on the internet. No wireless connections found. So I got my regular laptop out and booted up, no problems connecting. SO I called Acer, only through the email, told me to do a e reinstall. Lost everything went through the whole process and the blackout flickering started all over again. Got ahold of Acer again and was told it was a hardware issue to return it. So Amazon (You are so wonderful to do business with Thank You.) sent me a new one and I packaged up the old one and sent it back. All excited I opened the new one (#2) booted it up, went through the whole thing again and the black out, flickering started again. And no wireless internet found. So I got my laptop booted her up and signed right on. So once again I contacted Acer did the whole email thing and was told to do a e reinstall. Forget it. I called Amazon and they are giving me a full refund and I am sending this thing back. I will be searching for another travel laptop, does anyone have a suggestion on a great light weight travel computer???? Anyway don't buy this thing, not worth the hassle.",

I wouldn't know anything about it, I never actually touched it.<br /><br />For anyone even remotely familiar with routers, this d-link is plug and play.  Plug it in, and it works instantly.  To set it up, ignore silly discs, and just log in directly to the router, D-Link has a wonderful admin panel.<br /><br />Just go to 192.168.0.1 and no password is required for your first log in.  Setup a password on it, then go to wireless setting, create a WPA Personal password for that (if thats what you need) and voila, you have secured, wireless internet, all setup.  I had mine working completely in less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />This router hasn't dropped a signal yet in over a week of use, with multiple wireless connections and all 4 wired ports being used (TiVo, playstation, personal computer, network hard drive)...  Hasn't skipped a beat... fast internet.<br /><br />So please ignore the \\\\\"can't set it up\\\\\" reviews, throw the install disc away and just plug your computer in and use the onboard admin panel (d-links is VERY good).<br /><br />Highly recommend -- especially for the price.<br /><br />p.s. - I don't know much about the range, I have a 1200 square foot condo and it's full bars through the whole thing - so no complaints, if you have a larger house, you may want to consider the extended range version of this router.<br /><br />D-Link rocks!!!!",

I used a fingertip grip before I bought this but I chose to buy this mouse based on the reviews and the looks of it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, a fingertip grip is where no part of your palm touches the mouse, and you keep your wrist in one position and simply pivot your wrist and use your fingers to move the mouse. It is the grip of the master race to be quite honest :) A fingertip grip requires you to lift up the mouse a lot, thus a fingertip grip doesn't work well with this mouse, for two reasons. (1)- the lift off distance is too high (but I very easily fixed that by putting a strip of scotch tape over the laser, so that's hardly a problem :D (2) more importantly it's somewhat heavy and large so it causes finger strain. So I chose get used to the palm grip, and although I miss the precision of my old fingertip grip sometimes, the palm grip is very comfortable. It's a great mouse if you use a palm grip, and that's what it's made for so that's how I'm grading it. So...    Pros: uber-comfort, braided cord, 3 dpi settings, looks cool, 2 handy buttons in the thumb area, dpi switch buttons above the mouse wheel, unique/comfortable rubber-like texture. The box it came in is pretty cool lol.    Cons: you have to download and unzip the customization software on the Mionix website which is a hassle, the liftoff distance is at least 8 millimeters which is too high imo although it's easily fixed with some clear tape.     I know I've made a big deal about this being a palm grip mouse but hopefully I'm helping someone who was like me before I bought this.",

Unfortunately, my XPS 15 has an Nvidia card, and so I have the issues listed below. Displaylink has been aware of these issues for about 2 years now and has not come up with a patch to fix this. Maybe they don't like money. As always, however, Amazon was willing to take it back without any fuss. Another good Amazon experience.<br /><br />The docking station would have been the perfect solution for the intended use of my laptop at home...if it worked. There are two main deal-breakers for this device that I think warrant my sending it back.<br /><br />First of all, I use Windows Media Center (WMC) in conjunction with a Home Run Prime TV tuner to record and watch TV through my laptop (XPS 15) and on my main TV in the living room. With all the cables going directly into my laptop, it works fine. With all the cables running through the docking station and the one USB 3.0 cable going into my laptop, WMC will not open full-screen; it just shows a black background with the cursor above it. Even if I run it not in full screen, the video and audio are very choppy. If I can't use the docking station with WMC in full-screen, that alone means I probably won't keep it.<br /><br />Another issue I've found is that restarting laptops through the docking station doesn't work; instead of the laptop rebooting after shutting down, it stays shut down and I have to manually power it on. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but because I keep the laptop under my TV in a tight space with a million cords running around, it is not trivial.<br /><br />I've updated the drivers for the docking station--which also was not intuitive because for some reason the Displaylink software will not look for updates when you are running your internet through the docking station, and so I had to enable my wireless card from mylaptop to do this)--and that still didn't help either of these issues.",

I was using a Logitech G series for years and loved it until trying out this keyboard (which I bought at a big box store at discount while working retail).<br /><br />Only downside is this keyboard is NOT mechanical. I don't personally like mechanical keyboards as they are rather loud and I don't like the excessive noise plus the keys don't feel natural to me. If you don't know, a mechanical keyboard has a spring, very hard feel to each individual key. It's great for rapid typing as it will recognize every key press when a standard board may miss a keystroke if the key is constantly pressed and the pressure isn't registered.<br /><br />Despite not being mechanical (a positive for me) it is all around an excellent keyboard.<br /><br />It has a backlighting feature, three different colors Blue, Red & Purple and three brightness settings. The keyboard isn't as large as my Logitech either despite having the extra game pad. The standard format of the keyboard is the same, except the Middle collection of keys such as Num Lock, PG Dn, Del, etc are secondary functions on the numpad side of the keyboard (to reduce size). The keyboard also has solid media controls on the top of the board next to brightness settings.<br /><br />This can be a hassle because say you want to delete the line of text, if Numlock is on, it will assume you want the number 1 key rather then the secondary function &#34;Del&#34;. You must turn Numlock off then select Del for it to properly delete. This isn't a huge issue, a lot of laptops, tablets etc have this same concept. Think of it as a Function key but you don't have to hold it and combine keystrokes.<br /><br />The gamepad:<br /><br />This is the sole reason I bought the keyboard. The further distance for the standard WASD layout is naturally a better rest for my left hand; a great start. The keys are soft but easily register my motions, plus the keys for WASDQE are larger and better shaped for gaming. Above the directional keys are 1-6 rotating above with 7-11 just above those. They are small keys but wrap very nicely around the controls. For a while (few days) you will misclick quite a bit and hit wrong numbers due to the size but after practice you can really feel the layout and having 1-6 at extremely easy reach is a huge advantage, plus 7-11 being actually viable.<br /><br />Next to the numbers is a quick &#34;Load&#34; key, &#34;Print Screen&#34; and &#34;Save&#34; key, perfect for fast actions, especially screen capturing.<br /><br />Despite the perfect numbering layout above the WASD keys, I actually find myself using the alternate buttons spread across the gamepad more. Just left of Q is a Tab key (usually great for scoreboard checks) and a quick Caps Lock. Just further down is Alt, Shift & Ctrl all are perfectly placed and actually have a great natural feel for running/walk actions or keystroke combinations (alt + Mouse Button 1 etc).<br /><br />Most people use R & F already but Steelseries have even fitted R & F better plus made T, G & V easily to hit. In addition, the space bar is a smaller button but perfectly lands on my thumb, which allowed room for C, B & P. The keys are tight but I rarely mis clicks with the alternate keys in the beginning like I did with the numbers. The compact design allows you to use your index finger to hit the alternate keys or your thumb comfortably or both.<br /><br />Overall, the gamepad is the real highlight of the keyboard. Every key is exactly where you would want it to be. It definitely helped increase my speed and reaction times just by having the extra assortment of easy access keys to use. Not only that, the standard section of the keyboard, backlighting and media keys are all top quality as well. I highly recommend this for any gamer, casual or advanced. The gamepad alone just allows for a more comfortable gaming experience.<br /><br />The keyboard also has 2 USB ports & Headphone/Microphone jacks at the top.<br /><br/>Highly recommend,<br /><br />Thanks for reading/>Highly recommend,<br /><br />Thanks for reading",

The product comes with nothing in the way of useful documentation, either on paper or on the mini-CD. There is a configuration tool you can load on a PC, but no instructions of any kind on how to use it.<br /><br />I tried installing three adapters--one for the router and two for outlets. The outlet connected to the PC came up with a lot of changes of settings on the configuration tool. The outlet connected to a PS/3 was never recognized, though all the lights were on. (The PS/3 had previously worked with a Cisco powerline adapter.)<br /><br />The company's website offers multiple ways of contacting technical support. None of them work. For U.S. buyers, there is a toll-free number that is supposed to be \\\\\"24/7\\\\\". In fact, no one ever answers, no matter when you call. Sometimes you get a message that the tech support staff are all busy and please call back later. Sometimes you are asked to leave a message, but no one ever calls back.<br /><br />I also tried emailing the company. After two days I received a reply that asked me to repeat information from the email I sent. I wrote back, then nothing.<br /><br />After several days of trying to get some kind of technical support, I gave up. I could never get the adapter connected to the PS/3 to be recognized, and I tried every possible setting, resetting, switching the adapters, you name it. It worked fine for the PC, eventually.<br /><br />Bottom line: great if it works out of the box. Otherwise, don't bother.",

If you install these singly or as an SLI pair, you can go to NVIDIA and up grade the programs.

Granted the 600 series are 192 bit graphics versus the 256 bit 700 series, but from viewing other gamers 780s, I can't see anything different in picture quality. BUT, that might have to do with my Samsung monitors. I'm not an authority on this, but, I can tell you what MY eyes see. Flight simulators ARE graphics intense, and I have ZERO issues to relate to you. Two of these are still a hundred or more less than a single higher powered card.

The solution is every time after non-detection occurs, hot restart computer by ctrl+alt+del. Because at that time, ssd has finished power on self initialization, then computer will always detect the ssd, and boot continues to succeed.   Tested the same computer with other brands of hdd, ssd, without non-detection issue. Confirmed the issue is this ssd is slow on power on initialization.  Samsung has to fix it.",

If you're a constant traveler who constantly uses it roughly maybe there are heavier ones for rough treatment. I would and probably will looking at more of those products in the future.

When that happened, I would have to turn the camera off and on again (sort of re-boot), and all the pictures already taken would lost.  Originally, I thought it was the camera (a HP), but after some research on the web, I found out that it was a problem common to PNY cards as well as other cheap cards.<br />Therefore, when it was time for me to buy a SD card for my new digital camera, I got smart this time and did the homework first.  Thanks to all the reviewers on Amazon.com, I narrowed my choices to Panasonic and SimpleTech, both with almost identical specs.  I purchased the Panasonic card because of its slightly lower price at the time.  I now have used this card for over 3 months, and am absolutely satisfied with its performance.  First off, it is very fast.  My camera has a &quot;burst&quot; mode in which it takes 5 consecutive shots a second.  This cards handles it with ease.  Most importantly, this card is extremely reliable.  I have taken over 2,000 pictures with it and never once had problem with file corruption.<br />You will take countless number of pictures over the life of a SD card, so it is well worth the extra $20-$30 for the speed and reliability.  Highly recommend it with any digital camera.",

But had I known that Amazon does not allow library access to Kindles, which means no free rentals of e-books, I would have chosen another e-reader. Log on to your library's web site and see the long list of devices that CAN download e-book rentals, and you will be amazed that Kindle appears to be the only one that doesn't allow library access.     I have never been dissatisfied with Amazon's products or services, and have always had positive results from shopping on Amazon. So I can only hope that Amazon will see the disservice they are doing to their customers by forcing them to buy what they could otherwise rent for free. Perhaps if enough Kindle owners and even more important, would-be Kindle owners, were to protest, Amazon might rethink their position and be magnanimous enough to change their policy.    After all, libraries haven't put book-sellers out of business. Their free rentals of e-books may lose some e-book sales for Amazon, but they can also lead to more Kindle sales.",

The sound quality is a 100 times improved, allowing for a much more pleasurable experience listening to music or watching a video. The volume set to it's highest setting is loud enough that to have a conversation, I had to raise my voice quite a bit, almost to a shout, to be heard.<br /><br />I tried two different external speakers, both are 2.0 speakers, to see if there was a difference in sound quality with highly satisfying results:<br />[[ASIN:B000IF4788 Logitech X-140 2.0 Speakers]] and [[ASIN:B001ELK2NY Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver)]]<br /><br />The whole process of setting up the Creative Soundblaster external sound card took about 20 minutes, 15 minutes of it was installing the software and downloading the latest update to that software. The instructions that come with it are very easy to follow and intuitive as to where everything plugs into.<br /><br />Also, I love how small the external sound card is, just a little bigger than a deck of cards or an iPhone, so it takes up minimal space.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Creative Soundblaster external sound card to anyone looking to upgrade their current sound system, I know I'm extremely happy with it.",

I had to send it again to warranty, pay again for another box and almost 2 weeks and a half without my laptop. Oh and also this time I told them again to fix the charger/adapter problem....they didn't fix it. They didn't change my screen nor my laptop they just glued the thing together and 2 weeks & a half later (I guess the glue needs 2 weeks to dry) they sent me my laptop back.<br /><br />So 8 months after purchasing this overpriced laptop for such  a BAD quality. The screen is starting to unglue again in the part that broke last time, eventhoug I'm still on warranty I just started a business and have no time to deliver it to warranty and stay 2 weeks & half without my laptop. So my option is send it to warranty and buy another laptop or stick with this until it brokes completely.<br /><br />The charger is still bother, now the right usb is starting to fail often.<br /><br />All my family and friends told me to beware of HP's very crappy quality that they are not the same company they used to be.

It seems to me the DX and possibly the K2 are still just a bit \\\\\"too new\\\\\" and untested to invest this amount of money.  I love the concept and it seems the Kindle is a reasonably nice product.  However, things I have picked up from the reviews which tell me to wait for a year or two are:    1.  Price.  This is still a bit too expensive to feel comfortable that I am getting my money's worth.  Amazon should do what the ink-jet printer folks did which is give you the printer for almost nothing and you pay big on the refills -- give the Kindle away for almost nothing and make the money on the downloads.  This will get millions of Kindles out on the market creating a lot more demand for content.    2.  It appears the DX (and maybe the K2?) screen will likely break or get scratched even under fairly normal use - really bad design by Amazon and the current policy is to charge you $350 to get it fixed.    2. The other big issue is the battery.  If I understand correctly, you cannot buy a replacement battery, you have to turn your Kindle in for over $100 or more to have them ship you a new Kindle (so why can't they ship you a new Kindle if you screen breaks for the same price?)  This means that about every two years (average time for batteries to work for a long period of time) you are paying over $100 to keep your kindle working.    3. If you upgrade to the next Kindle, you have a good chance of losing books you previously bought that Amazon claims is \\\\\"safe forever\\\\\".    4. Amazon seems to believe they are the morality police and will delete whatever they feel is inappropriate on your Kindle - really bad policy.    5. I think having some kind of built-in led light would be useful to make it readable at night or while in a car or similar.  This would be a small drain on the battery, but very useful.    I think this space needs a really strong competitor to motivate Amazon to \\\\\"do this right\\\\\".  I don't see this taking off until there is a strong competitor and these core issues addressed.    Dale",

Upon receiving the device I set up my GAFYD (Google Apps for your Domain) account, and it started bringing *some* of my email into the Inbox on the Peek.

After waiting about 10 minutes, the email finally arrived on my Peek... obviously not push, or \\\\\"instant\\\\\" as they advertise on the box.     I then called Tech support to see why Push was not working properly. I was told that due to \\\\\"Network Capacity\\\\\" issues, not all accounts will have push at this time, and that as the network capacity increases, more accounts will be given push functionality. I was then told that could be 1-2 months before I would see such functionality. I was unwilling to wait 1-2 months for the promise of functionality that was advertised to come right out of the box. It is now 45 minutes after un-boxing my Peek, and it is now back in the box, sealed, and has a return label on the box.     The one good thing I can say for the Peek is that their customer service was excellent. The tech I spoke with was quite informative, and the CSR I spoke with after being told Push was unavailable quickly deactivated my device, and got me set up so the $49.95 I paid for 3 months of service would be credited back to my card in full.

I've had good luck with Patriot memory on my computer, and the design looked durable, so I picked it up at the end of June. I should have known that it would have problems, because from Day 1 it would get really hot when moving data back and forth. Still, it worked without a problem until early August, when I plugged it into my computer one day and found it blank. No partition, no data, no nothing. Testdisk couldn't recover the original partition, neither Photorec or any of my other utilities could pull any data from the drive, and even worse, nothing can put a partition back ON the drive. There are unrecoverable write errors when attempting to create a new partition, which means the memory itself is shot. After having such great luck with my previous drive, this short lived experiment has been a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />Patriot claims this has a 5 year warranty.

We bought it June 26, 2012, it started overheating and crashing in late March of 2013.  We purchased a cooling pad in April, thinking this would resolve the issue, it did not. Busy with the combination of school finals and traveling, I tried contacting the seller, ELECTRONIC777 in June (before our 1 yr. exp. date) and they said there was nothing they could do and to go to Dell directly. I contacted Dell, went through diagnostic testing, they confirmed there may be a faulty part, but could not advice me any further since the 1 yr warranty on the laptop expired in Jan 2013, because that was the purchase date they had on record.  They recommended I contact the seller since the seller should be obligated to honor the 1 yr. warranty I had understood it to have.  I contacted ELECTRONIC777 and they basically verified I was suppose to have a 1 yr. warranty, but it was Dell's responsibility and were ABSOLUTELY no help, in fact instead of helping me as one of their customers, it felt like they were basically giving me the finger and saying it's your problem.  I tried contacting Amazon, thinking they would step in on my behalf having records of my purchase date and the fact that I was indeed suppose to have a 1 yr. warranty.  I filled out all the requested information and they sent me an email saying it did not fall into the A-Z Guarantee.  Ok, glad they're there to protect their consumers, shame on you amazon.  So here I am with a laptop that is barely a year old does not work for more than 20 min without crashing, a seller who won't help me, and a 1 yr. warranty that was only honored for 7 months.  I'm still trying to haggle this out with Dell, but something is VERY wrong with the whole system, BUYER'S BEWARE.  I would never buy from this seller, ELECTRONIC777 again.",

It feels dollar-store cheap, it creeks if you put any kind of pressure on it, and the ergonomics are awful.

But even the free mice that come with store-bought computers do that, so why spend your money? If you're that serious of a gamer that you truly need all the extra binds, you can save the extra $20 or $30 to get a good mouse. This thing doesn't feel like it would last very long anyway.<br /><br />Tried to give it a fair trial, but ended up returning it after a few days and went with a Razer.

It passed all basic and advanced tests EXCEPT \\\\\"USB Full Disc Erase\\\\\". Tested it twice, and failed both times after about 10 secs. I called Seagate support today (06/11/2012), and wasn't given a very good answer except that the drive had passed all the other tests. So, in their opinion, the drive was not defective. (See below for a more detailed account of my discussion with Seagate Support.)<br /><br />Okay...<br /><br />Started \\\\\"MS's Adminstrative Tools\\\\\" to setup the drive for use on my system. It came preformatted as a 2-TB drive and the balance of the drive as \\\\\"unallocated\\\\\" (Drive is the 3-TB version).<br /><br />I saved the installation software in a backup folder on my data drive, deleted the existing partition, and attempted to create a single partition. This couldn't be completed as Windows has a 2-TB limit on the \\\\\"Master Boot Record\\\\\" (MBR) format. Okay, no worries, just create a 2-TB partition and a second partition with the balance. Unfortunately, that 2-TB limit applies to the entire drive and not just the partition.<br /><br />However, Windows offers the option of setting the drive up as a \\\\\"GUID Partition Table (GPT)\\\\\" which is an \\\\\"Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)\\\\\" format. OKAY! KOOL!<br /><br />Now to performing a full backup... Only Windows' Backup finishes with an error message. So, I try the software by Memeo included on the drive. Using Windows' Backup, I can perform acomplete Image-File backup. The software by Memeo can't. Hence, even with the drive setup as GPT, I still cannot use my existing programs to do the work I have completed successfully in the past.<br /><br />Today, 06/11/2012, I call support to determine if the drive is defective and require a warranty return? We discuss the test results, and determine that the drive has successfully completed all tests. The one failure allegedly has something to do with the 2-TB limit under Windows 7 (64-bit). Secondly, Windows' Backup has incompatibilities with the drive, and the included software hasn't the capabilities that Backup offers.<br /><br />The solution to these issues appears to be another software product that is available for free download from Seagate's website: Seagate DiscWizard. I am currently testing this product as I am typing this review.<br /><br />Regardless, I have come to expect better quality and service from Seagate. So, I am sadly disappointed by this product and lack of accurate information printed on the box.<br /><br />At the very least, a software driver that allows full access to the drive's capacity and features would have been an a nice \\\\\"invisible\\\\\" solution, but even that is lacking.<br /><br />So, my recommendation is to avoid this specific product: 3-TB, and stay with 2-TB's or less. My research suggests that there are hardware issues for older systems: the BIOS can't support GPT, and many operating systems can't fully support the capacity of drives larger than 2-TB's even with GPT.",

True, the current Kindle model takes a little - but very little - time to master the mechanics of holding it when reading, using the various function keys, etc., but what new piece of hardware doesn't require such time? Not many, and here the learning curve is NOT steep. Because we share one AMAZON account, we are able to download any book one of us might buy to the other's Kindle. This is a very cool aspect of Kindle ownership, since we can all read the same material at the same time and have a discussion without having to wait for someone to catch up. The battery life is phenomenal, downloads take seconds seemingly anywhere (we are vacationing in Kauai at the present time and I have downloaded several books while sunning on the beach!), and the selection of books, newspapers, and magazines for purchase and download seems to grow exponentially every time I visit the Kindle store. Finally, the cost of downloads is less than the cost of the print edition and will likely decrease as more people acquire a Kindle and begin to build their libraries. Oh, I almost forgot: an SD card can be used to store books within the Kindle itself so that an entire library will occupy the space of a few, or many, your choice, SD cards. As technology evolves and the cost of said technology drops as it usually does, I am confident that the Kindle will become the preferred reading method of all ages in all settings. I think that I just talked myself into buying AMAZON stock! If you are an avid reader, give yourself a gift, or list it for others who love you to buy at the appropriate time, and get a Kindle. It probably will be one of the better decisions of your life. Have fun!",

I'm no novice to installing their protective films, but ZAGG decided to try something new with the HD film which was clearly a step in the wrong direction.  Installation is not the same as their anti-glare, smudge-resistant films for iPad.  Instead, you have to pry apart two outside, hard plastic covers (one so clear, you might mistake it for the intended film), and then go through the usual spray process.  The problem, though, is that this film is a little thicker, stickier, and more prone to attracting the smallest particles in the air - so you have to act fast.<br />Once you get the film on the iPad, that's where the real fun begins.  The film is thicker and seems to not want to lay correctly unless you soak it in the ZAGG solution (included).  Once you get the film in position, even after spraying the outside of the film so the squeegee glides easily, hints of solution bubbles remain.  Not air bubbles, but barely noticeable bubbles of the ZAGG solution, that, no matter how hard and carefully you squeegee, you will not get out.  The first install attempt, I didn't even see them in a well-lit room.  It wasn't until I walked by a window with natural light with the iPad off that I noticed.  I pulled up the film, sprayed again, and it went downhill from there.  At it's best, it looks like a clear piece of cellophane, shiny, and mirror-like.  The iPad image is clear when on, but the surface looks like a mistake when it's off.<br />I will not purchase this version again, and will not recommend it to anyone else.",

I have been an Apple user since 1989 and this is the first non-Apple computer I've ever purchased. I got this as a second (or third) computer as I have an iMac as my main system and an ailing MBP circa 2007 that is still chugging along. I was looking at replacing the MBP with a Macbook Air, but was balking at the pricetag. I really didn't need it to do any heavy lifting in terms of video, photo or web work, but mainly to catch up on email, keep up with scheduling, do some research and use office documents. I've since found a lot more uses for it...<br /><br />For me the killer app on this system is the Remote Desktop app which means that you can access your main system remotely and use any app on that system, save to Google Drive or Drop Box and you're good to go while away from your office. It is small, light and very quick. I've had zero issues in the three weeks I've had it. I'm happy to be free of Apple's spinning beachball (curiously never happens when I'm buying something from their store...), the weight of my old MBP and am super happy that this cost me a sixth of the cost of a Macbook Air!!!<br /><br />Cloud computing is easy to get used to. Google makes it ridiculously easy. They will need to beef up their app store to make this viable in the long term and I believe they will do it.<br /><br />A quick note for Canadian customers. You're going to have to purchase this in the US and bring it back with you. A lot of Google's products like Google Play for music and movies don't work in Canada which really sucks. You only need the wifi version as the 3G is pointless here. There are plenty of great apps to do what you normally do in those bloated, overly expensive Mac apps (can't speak for Windows), it's just a question of finding the appropriate equivalent. To be honest, my MBP is sitting on my desk with the lid shut collecting dust. I don't have to think twice to take the Chromebook with me as it is so small and light. The build quality is really impressive, maybe not as sexy as a MBA, but definitely well built. Samsung and Google have really done an incredible job! Well done!!! I can't recommend this little laptop and Chrome OS highly enough. If you're on the fence, get off and pull the trigger.<br /><br />Now please get those great apps working in Canada. If it is about local authorities and licensing, then let us know exactly where we as citizens of this country can put pressure to get our monumentally stupid politicians to relax the rules so we can all play - happy to do it, just need a target for the arrow.ve to think twice to take the Chromebook with me as it is so small and light.

Perhaps they were damaged during shipping, but who knows.<br />I thought, no problem, surely I can just contact the seller and get an exchange. However, to my dismay, once I looked up the product on Amazon it said that this product was not eligible for return. My heart sank and I figured that I would need to go through an RMA with the manufacture.<br />Out of curiosity, I found a 'contact seller' link on Amazon and asked them why this product was not eligible for return.<br />Apparently, they were not aware or decided that providing great customer service was their priority, and they did just that.<br />Not only, did they tell me that they would accept a return, they even sent me a pre-paid return label so I did not have to pay to have it shipped back, amazing! It gets better, I had already been in contact with the manufacture about an RMA, but had decided to pursue the return with the seller first and if that didn't pan out then I would go back to them. Once the seller received the defective unit, they worked directly with the manufacture to get a brand new unit sent directly to me. I received communications from both the seller and manufacture letting me know the status of each step.<br />The new speakers worked great and sound awesome, my daughter is VERY happy. Separately, we also bought a stereo Bluetooth receiver and now she plays her music wirelessly, even better.<br />Kudos to both the seller and manufacture for taking complete care of the customer. Definitely recommend both them, and this product, to anyone.<br /><br />The sound from these speakers are amazing, clear and full range, we listened to some binaural recordings and it sounded like we were in the room with them.

While the cascaded router I removed was always dropping the signal, the TP-Link has been very reliable without it. The instructions for Mac users were very clear and did not require use of the cd. I appreciated the ease of set up and easy to understand menus. My older router was from 2007 so it had been some time since I had to install a new one. Visually this router is better placed out of sight. The slick gloss finish of the top is a complete fingerprint magnet and the grooves are begging for dust. It has a bigger footprint than I like - my old one was a vertical model - but the depth isn't bad so it fits into an Ikea Billy shelf nicely. Good option for a basic home unit.<br /><br />UPDATE: starting in Nov of 2013 the router would not assign an ip or connect to my desktop. I thought the issue was my desktop until January when suddenly iPad, TiVo, phone - none of them could connect. I COULD connect to my network extenders, which were able to pick up signal from the router. The problem went from intermittent to continual. After three months of trying to find a work around I tossed the router out.

The folks at Wacom were fantastic whenever I had a question or  problem (which wasn't often).<br /><br />Then I bought the Intuos5 Touch Medium in November 2012. My opinion of Wacom and its products has done a complete 180. My advice to any prospective buyer is to do an extensive amount of research, and not on the Wacom website. Find out what people all over the web are saying.<br /><br />Having been a long time Wacom user, I was honestly shocked to find that I disliked this tablet immediately. Simply put, it's too complicated.  It tries to do too much. It took a long time for me to search out all of the information necessary to customize this tablet so that I could use it without cursing every 5 seconds at all the crazy defaults. Additionally, the Intuos5 does NOT play nice with Windows 8 and workarounds were necessary. This is a documented issue, so if you have Win8, do your homework before you decide to buy this product.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Intuos5 USB plug is *extremely* loose at the tablet end & wiggles all over the place. This is also a documented issue.  I was constantly losing the connection in mid stroke.  I posted several requests for Tech Support to the Wacom website and never received a reply.  In desperation I ordered a Wireless Kit from Wacom.  Upon arrival, it didn't work.<br /><br />I called Customer Service and they couldn't pull me up on their system so I provided all of my information over the phone. They walked me through hooking up the Wireless Kit to confirm that it didn't work. Then I was asked to email additional info so that they could ship a replacement Wireless Kit.  Despite everything, Customer Service kept getting my address wrong when confirming info back to me. I kept correcting them and they kept acknowledging receipt of my corrections, but when I received the tracking number for the new Wireless Kit, I discovered that they were shipping to an incorrect address! There must have been 15 emails in all before they finally got my address right.<br /><br />I finally received a replacement Wireless Kit and it does work, but problems with the tablet have rendered it useless.  You must plug in the tablet's USB cable to charge the battery that comes with the wireless kit. My USB cable stopped making a connection to the tablet in March, 2013. I am certain that there's no break in the cord. The problem is the port on the tablet.<br /><br />I ended up shelling out over $375 for 3 months of tablet use. Wacom products and support are a far cry from what they used to be.for the new Wireless Kit, I discovered that they were shipping to an incorrect address!

Attempted to contact Seagate, you would need to fill out multiple pages just to have an online chat, so i opted to save myself the aggravation and return it directly to amazon and buy a WD elements hd.  I assume that any company can send out a piece of equipment that doesn't work, but i would expect to be able to contact that company w/o a lot of aggravation.  Rest assured I won't ever purchase another drive from Seagate, and I would suggest you do the same, there is too much competition in this market, and not enough difference in price to get stuck with a lemon from a company who makes it impossible to contact them.

Plug-in the USB charger to charge the keyboard battery for 3 hours on your initial use. Can't wait to try it out? No problem, the keyboard is fully functional while it is charging. The keyboard pairs to the iPad via Bluetooth. Again, simple. Just type in the code on your iPad screen and ensure it is connected and you're done.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with using the iPad has always been the terrible typing interface. The iPad is a powerful tool, but I wouldn't spend the money on one over a laptop or iPhone if I had to choose. This keyboard (so far) solves that. I love the functionality of the iPad and larger screen size. One negative, however, is that autocorrect seems to be disabled while using the keyboard. Before, while awkwardly thumb-typing, most of my mistakes were conveniently fixed without notice. With this keyboard, that is no longer the case. I also haven't discovered a way to pull up the native iPad keyboard, thus, I can only use the NT38B to type.<br /><br />The case holds the iPad securely, however, the iPad cannot be in a protective case. This thin plastic case likely offers little to no protection if I were to drop it, but I am not willing to test that theory. The case does allow you to position the screen in 3 different settings for both landscape and portrait settings, so that's pretty great, although it does make the case top-heavy if resting on your lap. You can also leave the iPad in its own case and use the keyboard entirely separate from the iPad, as long as you are within ~30 feet of the device.<br /><br /> The small size of the keyboard may be bothersome for some, but for a lightweight compact solution, it is excellent. The keys are responsive without requiring very much pressure, and the fn keys offer additional controls to the iPad.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this device. I would recommend it foranyone looking for an affordable compact solution for typing on the iPad.",

You get a panel on the left that opens up to reveal USB, Audio, and Memory card ports. Just below the left panel is a button that ejects a DVD-RW drive that is located under the right panel. Along the top right of the front is a white drive activity light and lit power button. There is also a standard keyboard and mouse in the box along with the power cord and quick start guides.    I got this PC as a gift for the in-laws so I opened it to set it up and make sure it worked ahead of time so I wasn't screwing around with it during Christmas. Overall it feels pretty responsive for a PC with a mechanical drive. There isn't a ton of bloatware installed, just a lot of links to things on the start screen that are easy enough to clean up. I think the only thing that I actually removed was an Amazon one click app. I'll let the antivirus run its course and then uninstall it later.    Some of the details I see now that I have it:    It has an Intel Core i5-4460S processor that has a Processor Base Frequency of 2.9 GHz and Max Turbo Frequency of 3.4 GHz.  It has a Western Digital HDD.  It has Realtek audio and LAN, I can't remember Wi-Fi / BT vendor.  I see a half height x16 and 1x PCIE slots inside.  I see two memory slots and both are populated.  The USB port count in the specs is for the back panel. You also get 2x 2.0 ports in the front.    You should buy a USB thumb drive or two to store backups of the system software. The PC doesn't come with restoration media. There is software installed that will create a bootable system restore setup either on DVD or USB thumb drive. I made a factory system restore thumb drive and put it away. There is also a option to do the same for the system apps and drivers only but it said it would wipe the thumb drive so I couldn't use the same thumb drive that I used for the factory restore. Thumb drives are cheap soget a couple and use them. The factory system restore was under 10GB so a 16GB and a 8GB stick would do it easily.    This seems like a nice general use PC that will serve my in-laws web browsing and casual gaming habits just fine for years to come. I didn't have any problems setting it up or updating it. It seemed to be pretty responsive and it is easy to open up so down the road you should be able to upgrade RAM or drives pretty easily.

They said that their lifetime warranty applies only to supported devices, of which they have a list on their website. According to the list, of Sigma products, they only guarantee that their 2GB SD card will work with Sigma DP1. That's it! For every other Sigma camera, and for every other Kingston card, their warranty does not apply. I have used several other 16GB SD cards from other manufacturers: Transcend, Patriot, Sandisk. They all work fine, in fact I never had any compatibility issues with any device or memory format. The worst part is that Kingston doesn't provide this list of compatible devices on the Amazon product page; not even a link to the webpage. So unless you have an explicit statement from Kingston that your device is supported, the card may not work and you are on your own.  It also doesn't help much that the Amazon refund policy is less than stellar. After I bought the card, it sat around in its packaging unopened for a couple of months, until I needed the card and discovered that it doesn't work. Although 30 days have passed, I thought I'd try and give Amazon a call after I called Kingston. They heard me out and promptly sent a return label my email. I sent the card back the next day. A week later they processed the refund. Without a word to me, they subtracted $4.00 for reason unknown, and $8.00 for return shipping. I could have mailed the card back for less than a dollar. As a result, I got less than half of my money back.  Lesson learned. I'll never buy another Kingston product, and will take extra caution when dealing with Amazon.",

Years passed and the idea of the Kindle started to grow on me. I read Kindle books on my Android device and thought it was pretty cool. So, finally, as a birthday present from me to me, I decided to buy a Kindle Touch. HUGE mistake. First, let me list the pros of the Kindle touch so you don't think I'm completely unreasonable.<br />-lightweight<br />-good size for holding in one hand even with expensive cover<br />-3G connectivity very good<br />-e-ink feature is pretty awesome<br /><br />Now for the cons:<br />-non-intuitive interface (For example, I don't know why you can't access the Home page unless you click the home button. The Go To button at the bottom of the screen on my android has a go to home page feature but not on this Kindle.)<br />-touch screen is TERRIBLE (90% of the time I was trying to get to where I wanted to go rather than actually reading. The touch screen would either: not respond to taps AT ALL, would take ten to fifteen seconds to load a single page so that I think it wasn't working and tap it again, or would go to the next page when I didn't want it to [like when I breathed].)<br />-page turn--well there's no such thing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY! It kept FLASHING the pages whenever I tapped to turn. It would sort of dissolve, go black for a split second and then flash on the next page. After about an hour of this I got a terrible headache just reading. Amazon, what it wrong with a simple page turn?<br />-Can't see the covers of my books in the home page (not even in black and white). It's just a list. I know that sounds picky and dumb but I'm a very visual person and I like to see the covers of my books. They're more familiar that way and it doesn't seem like I'm just picking out an article to read online or somthing. My Android device shows the covers beautifully.<br />-Can't just tap to get it backfrom screensaver, you have to press the power button (took me a while to figure that out too because the thing doesn't come with instructions of any kind).<br />-Text-to-speach feature is a joke (I tried listening to a few paragraphs of one of my books and the thing kept jumbling words together [as if it were stuttering] and would mispronounce things like \\\\\"Street\\\\\" for \\\\\"St. [saint]\\\\\". It didn't even recognize \\\\\"Esq. [esquire]\\\\\" and just spelled it out. I don't know how anyone would be able to finish a whole book in this manner nuch less listen to a few paragraphs.<br /><br />Conclusion: Kindle Touch = great idea in theory but the actual product is total trash. I can't believe how many good reviews are on here for this product. Do yourself a favor and go out and buy a smartphone or other Android device small enough to hold in your hand, download the Kindle app and use that. Much better. I'm sending my birthday present back to Amazon. Happy birthday to me. :(",

Once you connect it to your system, it FORCES a Virtual CD drive (VCD) onto your operating system that CAN NOT BE REMOVED IN ANY WAY by the user. This is GARBAGE! This drive is going right back. I have never heard of such an insane idea as this. There is nothing on the packaging to indicate that this drive will take over your OS. This feature is burned into the drive's firmware!     WORST IDEA I'VE SEEN IN 10 YEARS.  UPDATE 12-2-09  After removing my drive and returning it. We tried to remove the one on my wife's MAC tower. It took us 3 HOURS of horsing around to remove this WD software which had infected her OS/X system. Even with the drive disconnected, this WD \\\\\"smartware\\\\\" was running and dogging down her computer. We finally understood the slowness to be due to this dreadful software which is EXACTLY LIKE A VIRUS running in your computer. It took a LOT of work to remove all this WD software from her Mac. The WD Uninstall left behind many pieces of software which had to be discovered by running the process monitor.     Furthermore, you can not burn a CDROM from files you place on this drive. The entire system will freeze up and you won't get the CDROM out of the drive. All I can say at this point is that it would be stupid to purchase this drive when you can buy the IOMEGA Prestige 1T drive for $96 here on Amazon. I bought the Prestige and it is MARVELOUS. It is robust, heavy, runs like a machine and was setup on my mac in 30 seconds flat. It is a beautiful drive. When comparing the Iomega to this WD crap it is like comparing a Mercedes Benz to a Yugo.",

Thus far, the product has proven itself incredibly useful.<br /><br />Compatibility:<br /><br />I primarily use the hard drive with my MacBook Pro and was very impressed with how easy it was to format the hard drive to make it work with my computer. Sometimes with a non-Apple product it can be difficult to reformat the programs for them to work smoothly. I use the hard drive with Time Machine on my computer and it came in handy only a few weeks after purchasing the product when my hard drive crashed and I was able to use the external hard drive backup to restore all of my files. The included 10 GB of cloud storage allows me to access certain files from anywhere that I may not have saved on my computer. While this is a great feature, I wish there was a way to purchase more cloud storage for people who prefer to store more than the provided ten gigabytes.<br /><br />Design:<br /><br />The small slim design is very nice as a student for me to easily carry the hard drive around with me. The metal casing allows me not to worry about the hard drive getting damaged when I travel with it. On top of this, the brushed aluminum finish is pleasing to the eye when it is sitting attached to my silver MacBook on my desk.<br /><br />Overall, I am incredibly satisfied with this product and would recommend it for anybody in need of more storage space or wishing to back up existing files on their computer.",

I had to order the white version and I suppose it will &#34;grim up&#34; after awhile. White plastic always does. I can live with it! Finally---the spacing of the keys is closer to the Zagg but they are just a little mushy around the edges. Not a deal killer, but not as good as the Zagg.

I've now had a second adaptor fail in less than a month. One failing can be a random failure - two failing is a sign something's wrong at Tripp Lite, hence my revised one star rating. Unless you can round up a \\\\\"real\\\\\" Keyspan adaptor (pre-Tripp Lite), I'd give this one a pass. Too bad, because Keyspan made great adaptors.",

It's been flaky for weeks, but today, the Logitech Gaming software, for no reason- no updates, no system updates, no hardware changes- suddenly refuses to detect this mouse.  No fix available- older drivers don't work, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work, re-connecting to the receiver doesn't work, downloading the driver from Windows Update doesn't work. I now have a mouse (which I am using with the generic Windows &#34;HID-compliant mouse&#34; driver) that has NO FEATURES. None.  Without the Logitech Gaming Software to apply your custom profiles, there is NO REASON to use this mouse. I previously liked using the buttons to do auto-middle-click; mute; volume up/down, etc. NO MORE.<br />I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER LOGITECH PRODUCT AGAIN. They always end up having some glaring problem, but not right away. You think &#34;oh, finally they made one that works&#34; but after a time, it fails- and always in a way that makes the product useless.  Since Logitech seems to be the only other company besides Microsoft making full-featured mice/keyboards, I have ended up buying a number of them.  I have 3 mice and one touchpad RIGHT NOW sitting on my computer desk, this will be the FOURTH ONE I have given up on using.  (Mx705, M510, T650 and this Gaming 602.)  IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY and time to buy Logitech- their support will NOT help you get the hardware going again once it has gone wonky. They give you the &#34;reinstall the driver&#34; and reboot the computer, which in my experience has NEVER fixed the problem. There appear to be no more fixes, and I am no longer a Logitech customer.<br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  (yes, I previously said I liked the mouse. Hard to like it when it doesn't work.)<br />I've tried various other Logitech mice before (non-gaming) and there was always something 'wrong' with them- something I didn't like that made me stop using them. Either the buttons were placedbadly, or the click pressure was too much/too light, the shape was wrong, etc (you might say I'm picky).  I'm more partial to the Microsoft shape of mouse, they fit my hand better; I think they're wider.  I have a large hand and this mouse fits great.  The one thing I was worried about has turned out to be a non-problem: my thumb sits on the thumb rest, and it rests against the lower row of the 6 side buttons. I thought it might make me accidentally press a button occasionally; but since the buttons have a firm clicking threshold, it's not an issue.  They aren't hard to press, but the light pressure of my thumb resting there doesn't trigger them- you have to deliberately click.  Speaking of click pressure- the top left and right buttons are actually easier to press, they have a light click threshold. The left main button (index finger) is actually a little easier to press than the right or middle buttons. I'm not sure if this is a flaw, or was intentional. It hasn't caused any problems, I just have noticed it. I'm hoping as time goes on it doesn't get easier to press, as that would make it have almost no resistance. I've only had the mouse for about a month, so we'll see. The middle button/roller is very easy to roll, it has very light clicks while rolling, you can't turn them off like on some other Logitech mice. It also is a little narrower than the typical Logitech roller button, and has a somewhat grippy texture- not like shiny plastic, but not rubbery either, I like it - just right. I've also seen people say that it doesn't have the left-right (backward/forward) function on the scroll wheel - IT DOES. You just need to push a little, it takes a little more pressure. Not a hard push, just a nice solid click.<br />I'm not using the mouse for gaming, just normal computer use- browsing, editing, graphics, etc. The DPI adjustment seems to make little difference, it tracks well no matter what. The range is not a problem- it goes at least 10 feet, probably much longer,and there's a USB extension cable in case you need to move the receiver. The receiver is NOT the usual Logitech multi-receiver, it only works with this mouse. I just plugged it into a hub on my desk and it worked. Since I'm not a gamer, I like wireless mice; I really don't think it makes any difference that it's wireless, I've never had any glitches or lags in tracking. I do use a thin plastic mouse mat for optical mice, it works very well. I've actually tried it on two mats, the WowPad and a Corsair Vengeance (they are very similar surfaces). The mouse feet/pads make a slight sound when moving on the pad, it hasn't bothered me. I think it would be noisier on a cloth surface.<br />One thing I haven't been able to test is the battery life. I use it every day, and the battery level hasn't gone down one bar yet (I'm using both batteries it came with). Also, the performance/endurance modes seem the same- that might be different if you were far from the receiver. It apparently has great life like everyone says, which is typical for Logitech mice.  The weight is very typical for a two-battery wireless mouse, I like a little weight in a mouse, again it's just right.<br />A comment on the software- it lets you assign keys to each button, you can assign any key to any button. You can also assign any mouse button function to any button (left click, right click, middle click, double click, back, forward), including the DPI up/down buttons. Those are a little out of my normal reach, so I really don't use them, the thumb buttons are handier. If you don't use it for gaming, there are probably too many buttons, but not really a problem :).<br />Appearance wise, using it at work, it looks a little odd (sort of Terminator-ish); but for gaming mice it's nice and reserved looking. The part on top that appears silver in the photos is actually more dark, more a gunmetal color, except the DPI buttons which are silver. The top and buttons are plastic, the sides are textured but not rubbery. My last Microsoft mouse had textured but more rubbery sides, that coating wore off on two mice after about a year of use. This looks more durable, but only time will tell.<br />All in all- a really good mouse. I think I've finally found 'the one.'",

It is comparable to the OEM 6-cell battery.<br /><br />I immediately returned it when I realized this.  The seller was very prompt in responding and took the return with very little hassle.<br /><br />Please compare mAw/WH among batteries before purchasing!  My original battery for my TX1020 has a stated capacity of 7365 mAH or 55Wh.  The HP extended battery is 73Wh.  The \\\\\"extended\\\\\" battery on this page is only 8800 mAh!  That's only a life extension of 635mah for having 33% more cells.  Huh?<br /><br />After returning this I found a much better third party battery that had capacity (and construction!) more in line with the OEM extended version for about $45(US).  The OEM version is built so that the cells are staggered and hang down below the unit, so that on a flat surface it is propped up for better ventilation than the 6-cell or \\\\\"8-cell\\\\\" on this page.<br /><br />I recommend a battery with at least a capacity of 10,000 mAh instead of this battery.<br /><br />In response to another review here, all of these batteries must be fully charged and discharged completely one full time before they are properly calibrated.  The first charge will probably give really short life, and then perform properly after that.  This is not explained anywhere, but is necessary.<br /><br />Hope you find this review useful!",

I waited and waited for this Kindle refresh to replace it, and WOW... what a DISAPPOINTMENT  * DIFFICULT TO HOLD *  The lack of a keyboard doesn't give a guy a decent place to hold the Kindle Touch.  Look at the pics on Amazon's site.  In every pic the user is holding their Kindle Touch in a pincher grip with their thumb and index finger.  That's not comfortable for long!  Also, the touch screen is very sensitive, so even the most incidental screen touch when trying to readjust your grip will flip the page.  * CANNOT CONNECT TO WI-FI NETWORK *  I was able to connect to WiFi once... to a non-secured router.  I have not been able to get the Kindle Touch to connect to my home wi-fi using WPA encryption.  I've tried resetting the Kindle multiple times, re-entering the WPA key (there are no spaces in the key, which gave other users problems), and even tried using a Static IP configuration instead of DHCP.  Ever other wi-fi device that comes into our home connects effortlessly (HP laptops, Dell laptops, MacBooks, iPhones, iPads, Wii's, Roku TVs, etc).  * NO LANDSCAPE MODE *  Yep.  No landscape mode.  Lame.  * NO POWER ADAPTER? *  Seriously?  For $139 you couldn't include the power adapter?   Dear Amazon,   The Kindle used to be a premium product.  What happened?",

I have a large network and use a Cisco VPN router for Internet access.  I only use the Belkin for an access point.  Since I have so many wireless printers and computers it is not feasible for me to reconfigure IP address, subnetmask and security features.  The reason I say that is due to the Belkin F7D8301 not allowing me to set the IP and subnetmask for its access point feature to my settings.  When I set the IP address to 10.0.?.? with a subnetmask of 255.255.255.0 it automatically reverts to 255.0.0.0 which of course will not work on my network.  Plus I found that in the wireless security settings it only offers AES and not TKIP which all my wireless devices use.  This demonstrates how little forethought went into this router, it allows using the IP of 10.0.?.? with 255.255.255.0 for the router itself, go figure??<br /><br />I have installed Linksys, Cisco, D-link, Netgear and Belkin routers and access points for years.  The newer Belkin products are the only ones that are missing crucial settings and features.  I have numerous Gateway to Gateway VPN routers setup and wireless access points and Belkin is the only one that has done this.  All their older products had all the features and options needed.  Class A IP addressing is not an issue on a LAN and never has been.  Belkin's Pakistani support tries to use that as a reason until they are advised that when it is setup as a router it allows entering any subnetmask.  From the other reviews it is apparent that Belkin no longer wants router business from IT professionals.",

We keep track of all the<br />Sellers here on Amazon everyday so we know that do be a fact.  If ever<br />their are 2 sellers selling this case, we will modify our comment.<br /><br />The box in which it came in was totally cheap<br />and unacceptable (to why the case was damaged we believe.<br />We gave her a 10 per cent discount on her computer (she accepted).<br />This case cost us over 50.00 USD, (34+17 Ship) and at that price<br />anyone can find a much better purchase.<br /><br />This case has sharp edges and can cut your fingers if not careful.<br />The 550 Watt Power Supply is not switchable (big minus, and looks<br />poorly made) The Case is flimsy, has bad quality control, and, even though<br />is barely attractive, it does have certain aspects that people<br />like (like a handle - make of plastic), 1 Fan, and 2 Bright<br />Blue and Red LEDs.  This case does not have too much depth, so don't<br />expect to hold a huge motherboard.  It will easily accomadate<br />an ATX (9x12) and any microATX motherboard.

It surprised me that even with the exact same RAM, you now can't use two kits even when your motherboard can support it.

But with the technological advances of the last few decades, it really is all about the operating system. And I have so had it with Microsoft. I've been clinging to XP, eschewing the poorly written Vista, and dreading MS's threatened loss of support for XP. But what I finally tired of is the constant parade of digital hobgoblins that haunt the OS of every PC - viruses, malware, resident update monitors, anti-virus software, etc. All of these things erode and destroy the operating performance of a PC.<br /><br />I purchased this low-end Mac mini because it had the same processor as my PC - and it was cheap. I bought 4GB of Crucial memory, watched the video on YouTube, and effortlessly upgraded the memory to 4GB in about 15 minutes. It was not the easiest upgrade I have made - and I definitely do not recommend it to the novice. But I have been building my own PCs for years now. Incidentally, in upgrading my memory, I also allowed my nVidia graphics memory to bump up to 256MB - nice!<br /><br />What first amazed me was how QUICKLY the Mac booted up, since my PC takes FOREVER to load all the crap that is necessary to work with the flawed Windows OS. The second thing that amazed me was how much FASTER this computer was than my old PC, despite it having the same CPU and memory (I should add that I routinely did hard drive and registry cleanups on my PC, so that was not why it was running so slowly). The third thing that amazed me was how intuitive and simple the Mac OS X GUI was to work with.<br /><br />My only regret is that I did not upgrade the hard drive at the same time. However, I have a 1TB USB external that works with Time Machine (what a great background backup program!) and another 1TB Firewire800 external I use for data storage, so there is little pressure on the standard 120GB 5400rpm drive. However, I imagine I will - at some point - swap it out for at least a 500GB 7200rpm drive, which should boost performance even more.<br /><br />If you are using this to switch from a PC, keep your old mouse or trackball, but definitely get the new Mac keyboard.

That being said, it offers excellent performance for the price in a very small package with very reasonable heat dissipation. Despite custom-building every single desktop machine for my own use since 1990, I was able to get a Dell XPS 420 at a stellar deal some years ago and for the first time ever ended up with a \\\\\"branded\\\\\" machine. Fast forward to today and my machine is really starting to feel  dated, so I replaced a couple components. First, 8GB of Corsair memory replaced the old cheap stuff. The old video card was an ATI Radeon HD 3850, not a shabby card by any means but I was pleasantly surprised to see this card outperform it. I play Starcraft II, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age: Origins, and the Civilization series, and everything looks fantastic and runs in 1920x1200 at medium to high settings with minimal lag. I also planned on upgrading my power supply from the stock 375W dell to a Corsair or PC Power and Cooling Silencer in the 500W+ range, but it appears at this point to be unnecessary as this card consumes less power (and doesn't even need the extra power connector). Bravo, nVidia and EVGA!<br /><br />UPDATE: I've been playing ME2 and DA2 on this card for the past couple weeks and they do very well.  Once thing that has worked great is EVGA's Precision overclocking utility.  The GT440 easily handles a slight bump on its core clock up to 900MHz with shader clock to 1800 MHz, and if needed a slight nudge on the memory clock as well.  The GPU never ran much over 50 degrees C and the improvement in framerate is noticeable.  You're not going to fry your graphics card with these conservative nudges in performance, but you'll appreciate the extra kick for games!",

The description on the Amazon website is misleading, since there is nowhere where it explicitly warns the customer that this will be the case for this particular package.

I decided that I would just pretend there were no side buttons on the mouse and use it as a standard 2 button mouse, but then the squeak started driving me crazy.",

The Antec one worked well, but the power cord wouldn't make contact with it's connection after time and the fans wouldn't turn on.  I would have to play with it and get it just right for the fans to work.  And after a while it has become almost impossible to find the right position for it to work.  Plus the blue light got annoying after a while.    I got the logitech cooler today and it fits my Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop perfectly.  My laptop has a 15.4\\\\\" widescreen monitor and there is plenty of space for it to sit on the cooler.  There is a single fan as compared to 2 on the Antec.  The logitech fan is very quiet, it sounds like the fan on my laptop when it tries to cool itself.  The curved design is good for creating airflow underneath the laptop, which helps it keep cool.  When placing the cooler on a flat surface, there is a slight incline.  Some might not like it, but I am fine with it.  It helps make typing more ergonomic.  When placing the cooler on your lap, there are vents on the bottom that keep your legs cool.  The plastic is actually quite comfortable on your legs too.  I believe the cooling design for the logitech is definitely better than that of the Antec. There is space underneath the laptop and above the cooler to create airflow away from the laptop.  The only drawback is that the Antec came with a usb port so you don't waste one plugging in the cooler.  The logitech will take up 1 of your usb ports.    I would recommend the Logitech cooler over the Antec.  They are pretty much the same price too.",

Unfortunately, the one in this bundle turns-out to be a cheap copy of the inexpensive stand I already own; the rip-off copy is all hard-plastic instead of having soft rubber feet and cradle \u2014 which prevents the tablet from sliding around the desk when attempting to use the touch screen, or slipping out of the stand when pressing any of the buttons. The illustrations accompanying this listing all manage to inconveniently obscure those critical differences between this bundled stand and the functional version sold by other Amazon Marketplace sellers. You will absolutely need to use both hands to operate your tablet when using this stand! Mr. Yong Chen (aka, iShoppingdeals) apparently just doesn't care...

So now I have to order another one, and return this one back to china!!!<br /><br />Now when I order from Amazon, I can no longer be complacent.  I have to look very carefully before placing my order.

The keyboard case is matte black in color, and my iPad 2 easily snapped into it.  The top portion of the case (which holds the iPad) rotates so that you can work with your iPad in either landscape or portrait view.  I find that it is much more sturdy and easier to manipulate in landscape view.  The iPad portion also easily detaches, which is convenient for setting the iPad on a table by itself for watching videos. All ports/buttons on the iPad are accessible, and the iPad can be charged while in the case.<br /><br />The keyboard itself is sturdy and looks nice.  It is a standard qwerty-style, with a row of functional keys at the top (home screen, brightness, sound, play, pause, lock screen, etc.); I rarely use these.  The keyboard is a bit smaller in scale than a laptop or desktop keyboard (as to be expected, as it fits with the smaller iPad).  It took me a few hours of use to be able to use the keyboard easily, but I have now acclimated.<br /><br />My complaints:  The lock-screen button is directly above the delete button.  Before I adjusted to the keyboard's layout I kept hitting the lock-screen when I meant to hit delete, which was annoying.  However, I found that if I hit delete or any other key after locking the screen, it would unlock, so I didn't have to take my fingers off the keys to get back to work.  My other complaint is that the page up, page down, home, and end buttons do not work in Safari.  They do however work when typing documents, so sometimes I jump up or down the page and don't realize it.  I have found that I do this less often with time, so I guess it is all a matter of getting used to the scale and layout.  Overall, I would recommend this product and would purchase it again.",

You have to relink the two devices every time you want to use it.

I prefer paper books however I realized that getting to the bookstore or ordering myself books online was something I had less time for. I wasn't reading as much as I liked to and started to reconsider the E-reader. I am unable to provide insight on how this model compares to the others as I have stated I am new to the kindle world. I did get a small preview to one last year when my sister showed me her keyboard kindle.  I was not impressed too much. It seemed awkward to hold and didn't see much purpose in the keyboard. If I am going to highlight or take notes it will be with a good old fashioned pen or highlighter. When the new kindle models came out recently I was more intrigued. I liked the newest designs better. My husband struggled with what to get me for Christmas and I started to think the Kindle might be a nifty gift. I then was perplexed on which one. I did some research on Youtube watching self proclaimed experts fiddle with each model. My concern was that some complained about the touch screen usage and I was leaning more toward the 79 dollar kindle. I chose to go to a local retailer to test them out in person. I felt the 79 kindle was lighter than the touch. Not by much but I felt a difference. What I didnt like was scrolling through the keyboard with the directional button. I could then see the benefit of a keyboard at that point but again feel the newest designs are better. Unfortunately the stores only carry demos and the touch model was unresponsive. The store associate assured me the touch worked well and voiced his displeasure with the demo unit as it didnt help him with selling the product (with a degree in marketing, I have to say to amazon, this isn't a smooth move). With my husband in tow he suggested I go with the touch and was eager to get his Christmas present purchase for me taken care of. I was still unsure because ofthe performance of the demo. But then I had visions of a horrific orange ski jacket my husband bought me a few years ago. I chose the Kindle touch.   I got the unit home and plugged it into my computer. Set up was extremely easy and I found myself getting pretty excited about this new gadget. The kindle was charged within an hour and within seconds I was easily looking at book choices. I appreciated the free selection of books and had a few downloaded to get started. The reader is light and comfortable. I am a graphic designer and spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen so I appreciate the ink display that is easy on the eyes. The touch screen is responsive and occasionally I have tapped it a little too hard where it flips 2 pages instead of 1. This is a minor annoyance and I find most touch screens can get a bit glitchy at times. I was concerned about the ads but after reading many helpful posts from the amazon community, the ads do not pop up while reading a book. This was my concern. I ended up finding a few of the offers to be of value and recently was offered a best seller book for only a buck. Pretty cool. Another reason I chose the touch is the ease of tapping a word in the book to find its meaning or definition. I love words and like the quick easy access of looking it up. The kindle is the size of a paperback and fits easily into my small purse. It has been really handy especially sitting in a doctor office while most are fiddling with their smartphones I am getting another chapter in on my kindle. I am surprised that I became a fan so quickly with the E-reader. It really is pretty cool. So I can't give you major tech advice on the kindle but can at least share my experience as a new user. I'm pretty happy with it. Happy reading!",

I know people who have theirs for five years. Apple products are just built to last. Love how you can use your fingerprint to unlock your tablet. You can also add other people's fingerprints to unlock your tablet! Which is another really cool feature. You can also make phone calls from your tablet, and send and receive texts. The videos whether played through an apps like Hulu Plus or Netflix or straight from the Safari browser, never stutter or need to buffer. They have a large selection of apps specifically built for the iPad. The battery life literally lasts all day. It's just perfect. I can't think of one bad thing to say about this tablet. Just get it. It's one of those purchases that you will never regret paying for.",

I like to use this case when flying across the country. I can easily put my ID in one of the credit card slots and the plane ticket in the slot where you can also put money. This makes it much easier to find, remove and present to security and airport personnel while trying to check in. Much easier than digging things out of a purse, luggage, or pocket. The case stands well in landscape mode for watching movies and even comes with a pen/stylus for navigating the screen. The ONLY reason I give it four stars instead of 5 is because of the magnets. They are too weak to automatically turn the Kindle Fire HDX 7 on and off and possibly also to keep the case closed if jostled around in a purse. But considering I paid $5.98 including shipping, I still consider this case a bargain and worth getting.<br /><br />July 20, 2015 update: The magnet issue mentioned above was due to the fact that I was sent a case for the old Fire HD 7-2013 version which also happened to fit the HDX Fire. Apparently, when changing colors during ordering, the color I picked for the HDX was out of stock so the page automatically changed to HD7 and I didn't catch it. I have since ordered a couple different other colors as they were so cheap. The correctly-sized case magnets work fine. So I am upgrading rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. For the price, these cases are an outstanding value.",

I have a number of other Patriot, PNY, and Kingston cards that I use, but out of all of them, these Ultimate X cards are the *ONLY* ones that caused me to actually lose data.  (That's NOT good when you're working on a videography gig.  I'm so glad that I used multiple cameras or else the loses due to this card would have been irreparable.)  Even after letting my camcorder do the formatting, I still lost data.  Note that I was not recording in 1080p mode, so I wasn't even writing at the maximum speed of the camcorder.  I ended up getting others cards that actually work and have yet to give me a problem.  As it turns out, the write capabilities of these supposed class 10 cards are pathetic.  Transfers of things like digital photos to this card average 700 KB/sec and large files transfer at roughly 5 MB/sec, still well below the 10 MB/sec that they're supposed to write.  I doubt highly that the problem is due to the occasional defect because BOTH of my cards have exhibited this problem and BOTH of my cards have ended up being corrupted when being used with my camcorder to the point where all data is lost.  These cards might suffice for long-term storage or for storage of non-critical files, but after this experience there is no way in he-double-ell that I will ever trust the Kingston Ultimate line to my DSLRs or camcorders.

I'm now using TWO monitors on my computer which gives me screen real estate.  I had a 19\\\\\" 1440x900 monitor and a 22\\\\\" 1680x1050.  I intended to replace the smaller one with a 24-27\\\\\".<br />Actually, I was drooling over those 1440P or 1600P displays.  The Korean 1440P 27\\\\\" units can be had for about $300, but just how GOOD are they?<br /><br />I did some research found many rave reviews for the Dell U2412M.  At about $275 shipped it's a reasonable buy.  Yes you can get a 24\\\\\" 1080P TN monitor for about half the price.  What you will end up with is a stripped down TV set panel.  In fact, you could probably just go to Costco and buy a Visio full HD TV and use the darn thing as a monitor for even fewer bucks.<br /><br />A computer wide screen monitor should be in a 16:10 format, not 16:9 IMHO.  That extra height makes working on text documents in MS word (or Libre Office) easier as you can see more of the page.  I was too used to the computer based screen ratio to put a TV set on my desk.  The Dell U2412 is about the most affordable monitor in this format.<br /><br />If you read the reviews you might come across with the idea that this unit isn't perfect.  Well nothing is.  Technically it doesn't have the fullest color rendition, and if you need PERFECT color you might find fault here.  I've viewed photos taken with my Panasonic G3 on this monitor and flesh tones are correct with good contrast.  I haven't tried to set the color balance yet, all I've done is fool around with the contrast and brightness settings.  I'm not a professional photographer though, so take this with a grain of salt.<br /><br />After ordering this monitor I found out about a controversy involving panel version numbers.  Yes, mine is version A00 with a recent 2013 date code.  I don't know what Dell is doing with the version codes, it may reflect where they are buying the panels, and they may have changed suppliers many times in recent history, only to go back to the original source.  Who knows?  I can't see any dead or stuck pixels, there is no yellow tint or any other kind of defect visible to my eyes.  The unit was packed in a very ingeniously designed cardboard insert.  Some reviewers have complained about this, preferring the older method of molded white foam packing.  Well the cardboard is \\\\\"greener\\\\\" and made of renewable material.  That foam is made from petrochemicals, in other words OIL.  I prefer the cardboard.<br /><br />So far I've had this monitor for under a week.  It's brighter and crisper than the 22\\\\\" AOC that is now sitting to the left of it as my secondary screen.  If I had an extra $275 to spend, I'd buy a second U2412M to replace the AOC in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Cons?  Well it came with a single link DVI cable that is a bit too short for my setup and I'll probably end up buying an after market 8' cable.<br /><br />Some would call the lack of built in speakers or an HDMI input a con.  Really?  If you want those, then go get an HDTV and use THAT as a monitor.  This is a COMPUTER monitor.  DVI and Display Port connections are what are in vogue here.  Yeah some computers DO come with HDMI outputs, but those are probably intended for HTPC use.  I have a good pair of full range wall mount speakers hooked up to a 30 watt per channel amp for my computer sound system.  I don't need a pair of two by nothing speakers in the monitor!",

I looked it over and there were no cracks in the screen.  I had been on a bumpy flight the day before but it wasn't that bad and the computer itself was never dropped; for all the turbulence it sat on my lap.  I powered it down at the end of the flight and then the next day at work it developed the issue with the screen as soon as I started it.  No cracks and as it is under warranty I called Lenovo and sent it back.  They got it and called me to tell me it was $300.00 to fix it, the led was cracked and that wasn't covered under warranty.  I told them nothing was cracked when I sent it to them however they insisted, $300.00 or they wouldn't fix it.  I told them to ship it back as is, I wasn't paying them $300.00 to fix it.  Then two weeks later I got another call, they wanted $300.00 to fix it.  I told them don't fix it, send it back.  Another week goes by, same call to tell me they wanted $300.00 to fix it, I tell them the same thing, send it back as is.  It's been another two weeks and still no computer so I called them.  After getting the run around (they couldn't find it, sent me to numerous different departments) they hung up on me.  I am sitting here is shock at 1) how poorly the unit was built, 2) that they had the audacity to try and get me to pay them another $300.00 for a computer that I only paid $435.00 in the first place, and 3) what horrible customer service they have.  DO NOT BUY LENOVO, junk that isn't supported and the worst customer service in the business!  I am letting everyone I know what I have been through, I don't recommend anyone doing business with them, it has been just amazing how little they care about my business, and if they don't care about mine why would they care about yours?<br /><br />Update: 8/28/2013.  I got the laptop back from them after numerous calls and complaints.  The screen is now cracked, it was not cracked when we shipped it back to them.

I purchased my first HP Chromebook about 6 months ago. This is now my 3rd for personal use. Every member of my family now uses Chromebooks and Google Apps.<br /><br />this Chromebook has a nice 14 inch display that is very crisp. It is amazingly responsive on any website. My wife often operates it with no less than 12 to 15 pages open at any given time, with no issues or loss of performance performance.<br /><br />I love the fact that all work is on matically saved as you are doing.

It seemed like a much better option that carting around a bunch of heavy expensive books that once sold back would give me hardly any money. I got it after the semester started, so I waited and instead read other books to test the reading capability. As an avid reader I must say the paperwhite has a beautiful display. Reading for long periods of time on laptops or tablets hurts my eyes, I have really bad eyesight and astigmatism so long periods of working on my computer can make my vision worse (which sucks since I'm a college student).<br /><br />I wasn't sure how the Kindle Fire read, and after researching I found out that the reading quality was like that of a tablet or laptop (plus as a procrastinating college student with very little time, I didn't want to be distracted by all the bells and whistles that come with the Fire). So then I looked at the Kindle Paperwhite.<br /><br />Reading on the paperwhite was like reading an actual book. I could read for hours without my eyes hurting, and the lightweight quality along with the ability to change the brightness, font size, font type, line spacing, and even margins allowed me to personalize my reading experience. I absolutely loved reading on it, and couldn't wait to get my textbooks.<br /><br />As I prepared for my next semester I got a nasty surprise. Textbooks may ONLY be purchased on the Kindle Fire. So after spending nearly $200 to buy the Paperwhite without the special offers, a charger (because I bought the wrong adapter and then lost the original charger chord), and a case I find out that my sole purpose for buying the paperwhite was not available. I have no idea why textbooks aren't available, and there was nothing that said I couldn't buy textbooks on the paperwhite. I mean why would they advertise that it's great for the classroom if textbooks ARE NOT available?<br /><br />Like I said, I LOVE my paperwhite. But I am really upset (and I am trying to keep it PG) that I can't buy or rent my textbooks on this device! Like I said, I am an avid reader. But I enjoy the feeling of reading a paper book, the smell of a new book, the way the binding looks after you read a good book over and over again. I also love my overflowing bookcase, that can not keep up with my love for reading.<br /><br />If I were to rate the paperwhite by itself, I'd give it 5 Stars.<br /><br />But as a college student trying to make ends meet and find something more accessible, I'd give it 1 Star.",

After 2 months, the pull tab on one zippers came off because the metal piece holding it down bends with use. One year later, five of the seven zippers pulls have come off! After just a few months, the stitches holding the laptop compartment zipper have come undone. The right shoulder strap stitching has unraveled such that it is hanging by the edge elastic only.  I just wear this to work and back on the train. I don't abuse it.<br /><br />If you find a SwissGear backpack like this on sale for $20-$40, go for it and be aware that you may be replacing it in under two years. But if you are paying more and want a bag that will last, I suggest paying more and getting a bag from the OTHER Swiss Army company, Victorinox. I'm getting the Victorinox Big Ben. The quality of their bags is so much higher. These SwissGear bags tarnish the Swiss Army brand. My last Victorinox bag lasted 10 years and I only stopped using it because it was stained. Nothing fell apart. With Victorinox, you pay more but you get quality lasts (and a nicer looking bag too IMO).",

Not enough to be a real problem, but certainly enough to catch enough material to collect or take the brunt of the scratches. I then began the return process through the Anker website. Their response was &#34;We just got an upgraded model for this particular battery stocked,just wondering if you could give us a chance to send you a new unit for a try? Or if you still prefer to get a refund,we would be glad to assist you.&#34; So why did I not get that &#34;upgraded model&#34; to begin with?

The problem is a bit hard to describe but I'll try. Basically the keys are loose, that is, they're not solidly connected to the keyboard. Here's another way to describe it: Look at the capital letter T. Imagine that the \\\\\"cross\\\\\" part of the T (that is, the top part) is the key and the bottom part of the T is the piece of plastic connecting the key to the board. That's about how these keys are connected--via a too-thin, unstable connecting piece. Consequently, when you press down on one edge of the key, the opposite edge rises up, like a seesaw. This means that unless you firmly press down directly on the center of the key, there's a chance that your key-press won't be effective. For a fast typist like me, this means that at least once every five-or-so words I'll misspell a word due to an ineffective press. This is especially common with the letters on the top and bottom row, as your fingers naturally strike those at somewhat of an angle (unlike the middle-row keys, which your fingers press directly down upon).<br /><br />In sum, this keyboard is awful. I bought it because I need a built-in touchpad. I do love the touchpad. It's nice and sensitive, and the scrolling works very well. However, as much as I want a touchpad that works exactly like this one, the pathetic build quality of the keyboard made it necessary to return it.",

Still compared to other deals out there, it's a good price and savings.<br /><br />I like this monitor a lot, you can adjust the angle of the monitor up and down (not side to side) and it's a large size which is what I wanted. I'm not familiar too much with all the specifications, to me a monitor is just a monitor. The resolution seems unchanged from my old one and it's not the greatest resolution in my limited experience opinion.<br /><br />One thing I like is the ability to adjust the blue light and brightness and how easy it is with the buttons on the right side. When I first connected, it was really bright and I couldn't even look at the monitor it hurt my eyes somehow (not just from brightness, maybe the blue light?). I adjusted it down and it became much easier on my eyes, reducing the blue light to reading. There's still some things I need to learn about the features of light, etc for this monitor. But if you're looking for a large size 27 inch monitor with reasonable picture quality (or it's not as important to you as gamers) for a very competitive price, at least that I got, this is a good monitor to go to.",

It was an auction purchase and it was missing two pieces that connect to socket 1155 motherboard. I could get refund if it was open package but I do not make a fool of myself when there is a decent person on the other side who knows it was new factory sealed. Cooler Master denied my part request and they clarified they don't honor any purchases that are done at the auction, in their response to my review posted on Newegg. I must mention Newegg and many other retailers do sell at the same auction place. My resentment is based on their sense of economy which should cost them no more than $3.00(including shipping to my Los Angeles address) to take care of this issue. After all, they are the ones who did not include the parts or are they calling me and the seller guilty of lying for $2.00 worth of metal? Indeed, a good businessman does not limit himself by rules that ruin his chance of selling in the future. This tells me Cooler master is a rich company with executives who are too busy spending their money on other places and teenge part time employees who are too underpaid to give attention to a $2.00 worth of decision making. Why, who would lose all that gold on that Warcraft machine for my tiny fan?<br /><br />Date:4-21-13<br />After my review earlier today,I remembered my son owned an HP with an Athlon processor and I knew otherwise I would bug myself to buy the missing Intel pieces from Cooler Master and I did not want that as it was them forcing their will on me. So, Vortex go do AMD for my son as the pieces for AMD were provided twice as many thanks to Cooler Master quality uncontrolled. After ton of frustration I finally installed it and told myself, thanks god it was missing the Intel pieces. Good luck sonny, may you become a believer in the Cooler Masters.",

Unfortunately he dropped his Kindle today and we had to run to Best Buy to replace it (Thankful for Warranties).  Anyway, they informed us that they only had newer generation models, so we paid a bit extra to get this Kindle Fire HD 7.Our excitement soon turned to frustration once we realized that several games (including those listed above) are not compatible with this new Kindle.  This stinks because I have spent decent money on purchasing apps that I can no longer use.  Instead of continuously releasing new generations of Kindles, I feel that Amazon should focus on fixing such issues with the ones they have already created.  I would definitely NOT buy this kindle if you are used to gaming.  I expected better quality from Amazon.",

Completely forgot that I bought this hard drive in 2011.  So today I tried it out.  Hooked it up to my 3.0 hub, but it has a 2.0 mini connector.  That's not a negative.  It's advertised as a 2.0 device.  I decided to back up a large work folder.  No problem with the installation of this drive, unlike the other Toshiba drive.  Selected a folder with 60,000 files (60gb) and dropped it onto the Toshiba hard drive icon.  Everything seemed to be working fine.  About two minutes into the copying, an error message pops up warning me that they weren't able to find a file that's supposed to be there.  OK, fine. Skip that file and keep going.  But that choice isn't offered.  There were no choices at all, except to click the &#34;X&#34; in the upper right-hand corner of up window.  That being the only choice, that's all I could do.  And that stops everything.  So, apparently, in order to complete this transfer, I have to hunt down this problem file, resolve the problem, and then start all over again.  And with every problem file, I'm going to have to repeat the process and start over again.  There's probably always going to be a few corrupt files in a batch of 60,000.  When you come across a problem file in Windows, it gives you several choices.  Skip it, replace the file, copy both files and give them different names, do this every time the same problem arises, etc.  I don't care if there's a problem with a particular file.  I have duplicates and triplicates of these files all over the place.  Missing a file here or there probably will never make a difference.  I just want the hard drive (and its software) to copy as much as it can, skip over any problem files, finish the job as best it can, and don't create additional work for me.  I guess the people at Toshiba disagree with that.  One star.",

Amazon shipping was prompt as always.  The Card arrived in its original Asus packaging.  The first thing that i noticed was that the package seemed to be sealed differently with a long tape instead of shrink wrap or circular seal.  Another suspicious thing that was noticed was that there was a sticker over the UPC number.  But the card seemed to be as described from its looks.  I went ahead and installed it in the system and the first thing that was noticed was that the card does not install on the motherboard since the CPU fan was hitting against the BIOS battery.  I then went ahead and reviewed the diagrams on the card and it looked like the heatsink was mounted incorrectly, so went ahead and remounted the heat sink turning it around 180 degrees and now it fits properly on the motherboard.  Further all installations went smoothly and the system properly booted up.<br />So my thoughts at that point was that this was a quality control issue with ASUS.  After installing Windows 8.1 everything seemed to be working fine.  I then went ahead and installed the driver from ASUS and it seemed to go smoothly.  The system asked for a reboot and now windows started complaining that the driver for the video card is outdated and wanted to update it, and this is when i noticed that the card detected was a 6670 instead of 7250 which is one generation older.<br />I then went to AMD site and downloaded the driver and even that was detecting the card as a 6670 instead of 7250.  I decided to get more in-depth into this and started reviewing the card in detail and that is when i noticed that the card i received had a different mounting plate than what was given in the ASUS site and video outputs were all in the wrong places.<br />Called up Amazon and they agreed to send a replacement by next day air.  So hoping that the replacement card that i get will not be a fake one again.",

After receiving it it was quite obvious the cord would work.  I have used it quite a bit since and I am very pleased with it. I actually like it much better than the factory cord. It is longer which is nice, it is resistant to the wire breaking with a thicker cable and couplings to aid with protecting the wire from breaking after the AC adapter.

The setup is slow.  Amazingly slow actually, where it may take a couple minutes for administrative changes to work.  Administrative changes may also require a re-boot of this device and the computer you're using to set it up.<br /><br />You may need to read the manual, which comes on the CD.  You may need to update the firmware on the device (I didn't have to, as of Sept 12, 2012.) and the PC or Mac or Linux drivers (I did need to do this, and I was careful not to install features I did not want).  Another thing you may need to do is have your router's DHCP reserve a local IP address for the MAC address of this device.  (If you don't know what that means, don't buy this!)<br /><br />You may not need to install the Iomega software on your home PCs or Macs, because on up-to-date operating systems the built-in network software will recognize this device and do the right thing.  The Iomega software may only be needed for the \\\\\"Personal Cloud\\\\\" and other backup features.  Windows 7 will see the shared disk space under \\\\\"Network\\\\\" and allow you to assign a drive letter that will work, for example, under cygwin.  Finder in Mac OS X will allow you to mount the drive under the \\\\\"finder->Go\\\\\" menu and this will allow you to select the drive as a TimeMachine backup.  Probably a good idea to set up your DHCP so that the local IP address is always the same.<br /><br />Update: 6 months later it has forgotten everything in its programmable memory, including the partitioning of the hard disk.<br />All my data is gone.  Except that it's still on the drive, and I was able to recover by disassembling the unit and installing the bare drive in a Linux box.<br />For home use, it's probably best not to enable the \\\\\"security\\\\\".  This is primarily intended to protect areas of the drive from computers on your local network, and home users may want free and open file sharing within their home system.  The drive is still protected (more or less, depending on your firewall) from the outside internet as a whole, and backups can still be encrypted.<br /><br />About the Mac interface: the \\\\\"search for updates\\\\\" button in the version supplied with the CD did not find the new version, I had to go to the Iomega website and find it.  Also, Apple \\\\\"Time Machine\\\\\" files made according to the manual instructions fail.  There's an Iomega FAQ on this issue, you have to mount the backup volume on your Mac using the \\\\\"Go\\\\\" menu in Finder the first time you select it as a Time Machine volume, rather than refer (in the Time Machine setup menu) to the image created by the Iomega software.  After that one setup glitch, Time Machine backups work just fine.<br /><br />If you get it all set up, and you install the drivers on your various computers, you will have share volumes that show up on all those machines, even when you're outside your home network.  It does email out administrative problem reports, that works fine.<br /><br />In terms of drive longevity, it's probably a good idea to use the \\\\\"energy conservation\\\\\" feature and set the disk to power down after an hour or so.  It will start up again when needed.<br /><br />Of course IT'S JUST A SINGLE DISK, so sooner or later it will fail.  Don't store your one-and-only copy of anything on it!  If you need reliable long-term storage, go to the cloud or get a network attached storage device with RAID capability.<br /><br />I use it to backup my family's Mac laptops using the \\\\\"Time Machine\\\\\".  This works just fine.<br /><br />It's reasonably quiet, but not absolutely silent --- about as loud as a laptop fan.",

A big part of online gaming I have found is the interaction with other players, and a lot of that interaction is best done through voice.  I quickly found that my old cheap headphones that went over the top of my head with their boom mic were just uncomfortable for longer durations and the sound quality was poor.  I didn't want to invest a ton of money in a new headset, but I definitely needed a new headset.<br /><br />Logitech is a brand that I've long known from having purchased many peripherals over time.  Their quality has been decent enough that I figured this headset would more than likely meet my needs.  And, so far I've not had any complaints.<br /><br />The headphones obviously go around the back of your neck so they don't create any pressure points on the top of your head.  The band extends quite a bit so it can fit a big head like mine quite easily, I wear 2XL hats.  The microphone boom swivels up and down and can be easily swung all the way back to be out of your way if you just want to use these as headphones.  This feature is also quite handy if you happen to be munching on food while using the headphones.<br /><br />The cord is long enough that I never feel like it's getting snagged on anything or in my way.  It terminates in two mini-jack plugs so you can plug it into standard mic and headphone jacks on a computer.  It also comes with a USB connector that has two connectors for the mini-jack plugs.<br /><br />Personally I'm not a fan of using the USB connection since I've had poor experiences with USB sound cards before.  When the computer gets busy with other things suddenly the USB connection loses priority and sound gets choppy.  There's a few guys I play with who have USB headsets and they are frequently chopping out when the game gets active.  So I plug the mini-jacks in and let the dedicated sound card hardware in my computer do the work.  But, it is nice to know that I have the USB connector so if I ever want to use this headset with my laptop for a Skype type service it is there.",

I wanted to get that professional sounding music.. And in order to that, I needed a high end computer that can get the job done. So I did my research for a good year or so and came to find that macs are great for people who want to make music! Not only that, It's for people who want to make movies, edit videos/photos, and just be flat out CREATIVE.<br /><br />I've been using my family's windows PC ever since I was young and the main thing I don't like about it is that it's super laggy, awkward, and loud. I needed my own computer. So a couple months ago, i decided to get a job so I can save up for this machine. and now... 3 Months later, I saved up a whopping $2,400, bit the bullet, and bought it. (I got the 1TB Fusion Drive since I heard such great things about it).<br /><br />All I can say is WOW. Computing Perfection.<br /><br />I ordered it june 7th, and it arrived just last night! It said the estimated delivery was going to be the 18th (Yesterday) so after work i drove home, ran to the window, and just waited for the Fedex truck to come. I sat there for 3 HOURS. Just waiting. At this point is was 8:00, i lost hope for the day and decided to accept it was coming the next day, BUT! Out of no where, just as I was about to leave the couch, the truck came. My heart rate shot up and I just ran out to the truck before the delivery guy could even get out of his truck. I signed for the package and ran inside.<br /><br />I cleaned out my room so the iMac would look nice with its surrounding. and THEN, I unboxed it.<br /><br />I was pretty much screaming the entire time because it was so exciting. I remember lifting up the Styrofoam for the first time and seeing how incredibly thin it was. After unboxing it, I plugged this bad boy in and hit the power button. Again, WOW. It walked me through every step I needed to get my Mac setup and running smooth.<br /><br />I clicked \\\\\"Start using iMac\\\\\". And thats when the experience really kicked in.<br /><br />This computer is not only fast, responsive and fluid. It's so ridiculously simple to use.. But at the same time it is so complex! I spent hours just playing around with the settings.<br /><br />I still have yet to try most of the programs, but from the programs i have already tried \\\\\"Garageband, iMovie, Safari, iPhoto, and Photobooth, it's amazing!<br /><br />I've never bought anything so expensive in my life, But it was completely worth every penny. I've never been more happy with a purchase I made than this one.<br /><br />It's time to start writing my album:)<br />Thank you apple for making my first computer an amazing one!<br /><br />If you have an questions, leave me a comment!!",

The screen is exactly what it advertises itself as, that being a quality 22\\\\\" widescreen monitor. Shipping was unexpectedly fast (the time from placing the order to setup was less than 50 hours for me) from Antonline. Setup was a breeze, taking no more than a  few moments.    Using this screen with my 2.0 GHz Macbook running Mac OS X Leopard, all I had to do was connect one end of the DVI cord to the monitor, then connect the other end to the Mini DVI to DVI adapter I had purchased. After plugging in the power cord, the notebook automatically recognized the monitor, optimizing the resolution to 1680 x 1050 instantly. And I have to remark what a breath of fresh air it is to finally enjoy the kind of screen space I've sorely missed since ditching desktops 3 years ago (no offense to notebooks, but 13.3\\\\\" inches of screen space just doesn't always cut it). A very easy and hassle free set-up experience, although this is clearly my specific account of proceedings.     The images are very crisp. No dead pixels, no light leakage, no noticeable problems whatsoever. The included 3 year warranty definitely goes a long way toward my feeling secure that I'll have a functioning monitor for the foreseeable future. And should also add that Acer includes both analog (VGA) and digital (DVI) output. Many comparable monitors sometimes exclude the digital option, so to see both ends of the spectrum covered is in this instance a pleasant surprise.    There are a few shortcomings worth mentioning, the most notable of which is the omission of any sort of speaker system. I bought it as a monitor, so this was not a major problem for me, although I suppose it would be convenient to consolidate the various PC peripherals in the name of conserving precious desk real estate.    However, at the end of the day there is very little to complain about here. The monitor offers a quality picture at a price point that is virtually unbeatable for a unit of this size. This definitely a product worth considering for anyone interested in upgrading to a unit with a little more screen space, or for anyone looking for an affordable second monitor.",

Additionally, the quality of design, materials, and construction FAR exceeded my expectations considering what I paid (under $15).    General comments:  Basic sleeve design for a netbook or iPad, as advertised.  The construction is high quality, especially for the price.  The material feels sturdy in hand, but is exceptionally light.  Both sides of the sleeve are padded (neither side is rigid).  The interior surface is smooth nylon.  The interior portion of the zipper is protected from contents by a lip of fabric which, by its design, does NOT get caught up in the zipper.  The zipper itself runs from the top left corner of the sleeve all the way down the right side of the sleeve, giving you the flexibility to only open the sleeve from the top or open it up more widely.  Accented patches at the bottom and front center are a nice touch, providing good grip points.    iPad specific:  Bought the sleeve to house my iPad.  Was despairing because I could not find a simple case to house both my iPad and my Apple wireless keyboard.  Thought I would be forced to leave the sleeve open at the top with the keyboard sticking out.  To my surprise, the iPad AND keyboard fit nicely together in the sleeve.  The keyboard takes up the maximum height of the case, but the zipper closes nicely without being forced or rubbing, even with the iPad inside also.",

There are MANY MANY existing issues which have not been resolved in firmware upgrades, even Linksys site has the issues listed yet has not put out a new firmware in well over a year. Yet they recently put out a firmware for Britain which fixed the issue with connections being dropped. Even then, this router randomly drops connections after a few hours, VPN through this router is nearly impossibly if you need to use your connection for more than 10 minutes. And what takes the cake is that a simple firmware update bricks the router, amazing. Between this and the rest of the Linksys routers I've owned, I'd say Linksys is going downhill with the crap they're pushing out. Coming from someone who used to swear by Linksys, thats pretty bad.",

I basically have 2 problems both boiling down to the complete lack of ergonomics in the design of the G13.  The thumb stick drives me absolutely crazy for 2 reasons, the position relative to the buttons (claw hand) and the awkwardness of using a thumb stick in games designed for button presses.<br /><br />One of the things I liked about the controller when I saw it online was that it had so many buttons, when playing MMOs you seem to never have enough so I figured more is better.  Not so much. Even after 2 years I struggle to hit the right buttons consistently which I attribute to the fact that they didn't put a home key bump on any of the keys.  With so many buttons, and with my eyes on the game, I lose track of where my hand is on the device.  Additionally reaching the far buttons is difficult, and next to impossible to reach while using the thumb stick.  Also having 2 rows of 7 buttons is a very odd choice because it really doesn't map to any UI implementation in the game universe that I can think of.<br /><br />Lastly, the LCD screen is nice eye candy, but it's not really very useful.  At least I can't find much of a use for it.  As I said before, I like to keep my eyes on the game not the controller.",

The only complaint I had upon unboxing was that there is a pretty heinous crease created in the cable due to the way they ship it, but this is mainly cosmetic.<br /><br />I primarily needed the upgrade for gaming purposes. I did see a noticeable reduction in latency, over switching from the wireless connection from the same router/modem combo.  and I was attracted the to flat profile, as well as the capability of the cable. The cable easily fits between the carpet and the wall, but could easily be secured with a staple gun. You could easily run this cable throughout the walls in your home and you'd be set for a good number of years as far as increases in the capability of data transmission. Most Ethernet cables are category 5, which were cutting edge in 1990.

There is some backlight bleeding around the edges but it's pretty minor and also pretty standard for thin and light laptops with such thin screens.  The chassis is thin, light, feels reasonably durable.  The screen appears to press against the keyboard with fairly small amounts of pressure when closed so I'd recommend a protector to sit between the keyboard and screen when closed if you intend to carry the laptop in a soft case which might allow some pressure on the back of the screen.  The keyboard has very little travel, which is typical of such thin notebooks but the mushy feel at the end of the key travel is not so forgivable.  The track pad is nice enough, it won't blow your mind but it gets the job done without hindering your use.  On the whole I'm fairly positive on the hardware.  Many of the shortcomings are part and parcel of such a thin and light notebook.  The only one that really bothers me is the mushy and cheap feeling keyboard.  But it's matched with a really lovely screen so pick your poison.  On hardware alone I'd probably give this notebook 4 stars.  It's not perfect by any means, but it's a nice balance of mostly well built elements, light weight, thin profile, decent battery life, inexpensive.  The software is what really kills this notebook though.<br /><br />Software:<br />The big reason for the 1 star review is the extremely cynical and user hostile shovelware that comes with this laptop.  It's been a few years since I've bought a new laptop so maybe they are all like this now, but in my opinion Samsung set a new bar for computer crippling crapware.  I'm used to shovelware on new windows machines, but this is frankly ridiculous.  In addition to the usual software that you don't want but can easily uninstall are some Samsung utilities and updaters that hog resources at every second and cannot be removed.  As far as I can tell they can't be removed at all, like a bad virus.  And you have to jump through some major hoops just to disable them from running all the time (but still not remove them).  And when running they love to point out that you removed Norton security and would you like to reinstall it so Samsung can get another dollar from Symantec.  It's shameful and disappointing.  I blew away that windows install and put Ubuntu on it (some hiccups but it works quite nicely).  I you are tech savy enough to scrub the windows install that comes on this machine and install something fresh, either Linux or a fresh Windows install, then consider this laptop a 4 star machine.  If you intend to use it as it comes out of the box, then a 1 star machine is what you will have.",

Watch the video on their web site. This is really imp.<br />2. Apply the liquid thoroughly on both the sides of the screen protector and on the device.<br />3. Make sure u cover the speakers on both sides with a tape. Liquid could get into our speakers.<br />4. If this is the 1st time u r using this type o protector you will see lot o patchy air bubbles ,which will look like dirt.... Just ignore them... They will disappear in a day.<br />5. When you push air bubbles during installation with the rubbery thing provided in the kit... Make sure u wet the outer side of the screen protector. Else u will end up having tiny scratches.<br /><br /> Over all this is a easy one to install..... But........ You have to watch the installation video...<br />Good luck....",

I use the grey side out, but the orange is also very nice; the colors seem to be pretty true to how my computer displays them.<br />I love that it is reversible, which is something that played a part in my choice for a sleeve. Something that wasn't clear (at least to me) from the images is that there are two pockets: one for the device, and then another one, which due to the reversibility can be positions in front of the pocket for the device with the flap covering it or in the back (opposite side as the flap). If you are using the grey side out, if you flip the second pocket to the back, it will be orange. Likewise, if you have the orange side out, the second pocket will be grey when you have it to the back. Some pocket positions are somewhat awkward, mainly with all orange outward, both pockets towards the flap side, but that's the only potential downside I can see.<br />When I bought this, I was worried that the flap might be difficult to work with, but I have found it to be no trouble at all, very easy to work flip over the device when opening and closing the sleeve.",

The clerks told me they no longer had them and when I saw three of them in the cage he then told me they were no longer $228 but now were $279.  I told him I wanted to see the box so he got one out and then I told him to scan it.  He was  a little reluctant to admit it was still $228 but did so.  All that said if you go to look for one of these look in the on hand inventory cages of the laptop section.  I have seen them now that way in three stores and none on display or anyone to admit or realize they even have them.    Unpacked this unit and it was very well packaged and protected in fact better than some very expensive laptops I have purchased in the past.  I plugged in the battery and powered it up and turned it on.  Immediately it came to life and started the Windows 7 starter edition set up.  Everything loaded it hooked up my wifi did the registration and it was ready to go.  Display is clear and bright.  Keyboard is responsive although the keys are a little small so it takes a little getting used to.  Touchpad works very well.  Good sound quality.  Battery life about 3 hours, maybe a little more in power saving mode.  Huge 250 gig hard drive much larger than most netbooks.  Build quality is very good.  This is without a doubt an Acer One with Emachine's name on it.  The Acer's on display had 160 gig hard drives and were $299 so as I said this is a great buy.  I upgraded the one gig memory to 2 gigs which was super easy as it has an access door with one screw to get to the chip.  Also it has an access door for the hard drive so if ever needed it would be an easy replacement.  I removed the extra trial programs, (Norton, MS Office and also reset the startup files removing some of the auto load stuff.  Loaded the MS Mail program and set up the email accounts, downloaded the free Open Office program and AVG antivirus and you now have a very well functioned netbook!  Loads well and everything worked perfectly from the very beginning.  With the Emachine recovery manager and a external DVD writer drive you can create restore disks or you can restore the unit from a hidden partition on the hard drive.  Super light unit and easy to take anywhere.  Nice black and silver finish which looks more expensive than some of the higher priced units and brands.  One year warranty which I don't know how good any service would be from Emachine but if it continues as it now works I don't expect to have to use the warranty.  If you are looking for a small form factor netbook that has pretty much anything you would need in a netbook this is a hard to beat deal but I am sure they will disappear before long as the Walmarts that did get them for the never happened Day After Christmas Sale only got 10 of them so when they are gone they will be gone.  If you are looking for this kind of unit get to looking and if you find one buy it.  You will be very pleasantly surprised!",

I had already purchased a great case for my new Kindle HDX, but at this price, I just had to take advantage of it. Both of these cases were excellent and each had great features. The roo case was heavier and thicker for overall placement and protection of your Kindle HDX, where the Slim Shell Origami Case was much thinner and lighter, but had a great concept of folding the front cover in different positions to act as a back stand for using your Kindle HDX on a flat surface. Both cases had cutouts and ports for all the unique buttons, camera and microphone that are part of the new HDx design. I easily gave these cases 5 stars because everything in the equation was excellent. They arrived on time and in good packaging. Both were in excellent condition when they arrived. &#34;Two Thumbs Up&#34;, to not only Amazon, the the supplier as well.

            "input": "My previous PC (which is still in use) was an excellent computer, but in the past three years a lot of improvements have become standard issue on PCs while I had to keep buying adapters and dongles to use new technology on my older machine. I am delighted that this computer came standard with Bluetooth capabilities, USB 3.0 ports and HDMI support. With this unit I was able to hook up my bluetooth keyboard, wireless mouse, and HDMI monitor and really minimize the amount of cords going into the back of my computer and the amount of stationery devices on my desktop. The PC was entirely hooked-up in less than a minute. Actually booting up the PC for the first time with Windows 8 also seemed faster than my Windows 7 launch. Be forewarned that you need to sign-in with an existing Windows Live ID or create one.<br /><br />The design of this computer is very attractive. It stacks up as slightly taller (about 1/2\\\\\") than my last HP PC. This largely seems to be because of the top-mounted headphone, Microphone, and USB 2.0 jacks. These jacks face the back of the computer. The top of the PC (minus the dash for the plugs), has a beveled shape which makes it nice for charging and storing devices since it minimizes the chances for accidentally knocking a peripheral off the top of the PC (see my picture uploaded by the product images). The splashes of red color you see in the photograph are actually light strategically peeking out from the case to lend a specific aesthetic to the tower.<br /><br />I wanted to focus on the details above first since the product description page offers almost all the item hardware and software specifics an individual would need to know. However, I do have a few comments about those also.<br /><br />The computer does not have a VGA input, but it includes a dongle that adapts your VGA cable to fit in the DVI port. I was delighted by this because I was able to use my HDMI cable from my monitor to this computer and use my existing VGA cable to keep my older computer hooked up to the same monitor (the HP w2207h).<br /><br />It only took me a couple of days to get accustomed to the Windows 8 interface, but I can see how it would be a bit overwhelming to someone not already familiar with apps in another OS or without a touch device that maximizes it. My bluetooth keyboard (the PC comes with both a standard cord-attached USB keyboard and mouse) allows me to scroll through open apps and the other actions are easy enough to do with a standard mouse and the use of the Windows start button on keyboards. I found that claims about being able to reach the old desktop are greatly exaggerated unless you pin everything you love to the taskbar since there is no way to add the classic start screen button to the desktop view without installing third-party software and tweaks. For those who do not want to adapt, this computer has such incredible hardware that buying it with the Windows 8 and then installing Windows 7 would be an option provided you have the tech chops to handle any potential driver recognition issues that would pop up - HP warns that this is a possibility - there is a Computer World article this some depth if you search their website.<br /><br />So far, I have installed the full Microsoft Office Professional Suite and one of the design variations of the Adobe Creative Suite 5.0. It features a little over half of the CS programs. After installing these programs and the initial launch, I could click on one of the programs, like Photoshop Extended Edition, and have it fully up and ready to run in 1.8 seconds. Word launches in approximately the same amount of time. For the price of this PC and considering the hardware, I would expect that, but it is still incredible to watch. My old computer had an AMD Quad Core processor with acceptable speed, so I unsure if this unit would be faster, and I definitely should not have been. I've never had these programs launch this fast. Also, the somewhat large installs barely made a blip in the hard disk space.<br /><br />Windows 8 and HP have added a few new features to the computer that many of us will probably appreciate. Now, after connecting the computer with my Facebook account and iPod touch, the \\\\\"My Photos/Pictures\\\\\" shows off both my uploaded pictures and the photos from Facebook and the iPod all in one place instead of my needing to manually pull them in from the device. These can be browsed both in the standard manner from the desktop screen or with the \\\\\"Photos\\\\\" tile. The \\\\\"Photos\\\\\" tile offers full screen images without prompting and features handy delete, rotate, and crop buttons when you right click. HP also has a \\\\\"connected remote\\\\\" you can download as a smartphone or tablet app which allows you to play videos and music from your smartphone or iPod. I like this feature a lot because it kept me from having to import the music I have on my iPod that isn't stored in Apple's Cloud into this PC for listening. You can just play it through the system from your phone or player. When I saw the computer specifics mention a remote, I presumed it was a physical remote, but this is much better. Another really nice improvement with this PC is that I did not have to manually install my HP wireless printer, the PC recognized it automatically.<br /><br />I only have one complaint. I am a bit surprised that this unit did not come standard with a Blu-ray player installed. I have seen a Blu-Ray player featured on many PCs with a lower cost and that aren't geared toward gamers or massive resource consumers like myself. There is an expansion bay that would allow me to install one, but it feels like something that should be a given in a product of this cost at this point in time. However, I am not ducking a star on the product since it is clear in the product specifications that only a combo DVD player/burner is included.<br /><br />When reviewing an item like this, I always feel like I am forgetting to mention something important, so feel free to ask me a question by leaving a comment if there is something you want to know.",

Seagate also will not refund the purchase price of the drive and Amazon says its too late to get refund. Anyone interested in a class action lawsuit?

This seems to be a common theme for Alink+ products across the boards.  I also have used an Airlink+101 router; good luck finding the model numbers on any of these products if you don't have the box handy.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If all you want to do is get the wireless networks at home, at the library or in most coffee shops, then you really can't go wrong with the Airlink+ 802.11g Wireless CardBus Adapter; especially for the price.<br />If you work with Linux or you have a tendency to tinker with this setting or that setting and are really into customization, then you may want to go with something that is a little more robust.<br />Geek Gage: If you have any of the following at home then you will probably want to look for a little more robust card:<br />* A domain controller<br />* A Linux Router<br />* Two Wireless Routers that are connected to each other<br /><br />Link to the manual: [...]<br />[...]",

It is great for a beginner but doesn't have a few things an advanced computer user would want.  Eg. It does not allow you to pick certain dates for the backup. It allows you to pick daily, weekly and a few other things.  The main thing about the back up software was it DOES NOT erase any old backups after it creates new ones.  You have to manually go in and erase any back up you want to get rid of.  I ended up using a new 100 dollar back up software for the drive and it was worse.  Do a lot of research and make sure that you get the right software.  The best I have seen is an Image back up software that will erase old back ups and allows you to set all those settings yourself.  For the amount I paid for the drive it was WELL worth the money and perfect for a Laptop and/or travel purposes.  I fully recommend this drive!!!",

In short - the temperature differences blew my mind. The first 8 cores were running at about 39-40c at idle, while the second set of 8 cores (on the cpu with the new cooler) were running between 68-75c!!!

I returned the defective backback and it took almost a month for the replacement to arrive. Despite the backback being under warranty, I had to pay UPS for the privilege of returning it. The replacement backback did not match Targus' website description and did not reveal that carrying handle was permanently attached across middle of the should straps, making it completely unwearable.

I would give 5 stars to any of the other Amazon basics cables, but I simply can not give this better than a 1/2 star.",

There's an auto setting to optimize the TxRate in the event of an unreliable signal, and 11Mbps is way more than broadband needs, AFAIK.<br />The installation under Win98 was accomplished seamlessly, truly PNP; it hopped right on the network and got all the info it needed from DHCP. Which reminds me, always restrict access to (and encrypt) your wireless network, unless you want to give free bandwidth to any chucklehead in a 200 ft radius. This chucklehead helps his neighbor with her computer pretty often and I plan on proposing that I continue to do so free of charge and/or share the costs. Power to the people!",

For example, I recently bought this brand new router for my home network because I wanted to install an external drive to use for back ups (recent hard drive crash - few backups...oops). I shopped around and chose the RT-N16 router based on various reviews posted on Amazon and other sites. Those reviews showed love for the router, but not so much for the router's firmware.<br /><br />So I got the router, and immediately downloaded and installed the \\\\\"recommended\\\\\" firmware (DD-WRT). Now the reviews said that using DD-WRT, I would need to be at least \\\\\"moderately\\\\\" tech savvy. I thought that would mean 'not afraid to go into settings and change a few things around'. What they actually meant was \\\\\"Are you within just a few hours shy of getting your Computer Science Doctorate?\\\\\"  Now, I'm not a computer noob, I've built my own computers, done some programming, I am regularly changing settings and experiment with my home network, computer, etc. but this was just way, way over my head.  I have to give a great big thumbs DOWN to DD-WRT.  I followed their wiki directions to the letter (what I could translate) and failed at every turn to accomplish my desired task.<br /><br />Anyway, I spent over a week in research and attempts trying to set up my network drive (I do enjoy solving technical problems, and I'm stubborn...) all to no avail. After talking to a couple friends, who suggested I just buy a router with the capabilities I wanted built in (which, of course, I had already done with this router) and try that. Finally, after trying a couple more versions of the software I was using, I decided to give the OEM operating system a try.<br /><br />It was so easy. It did what I wanted to do easily, and without the Computer science degree. It even shared the drive with my DVD/Blu-ray, so my saved movies can be watched on my tv. It has a nice, friendly GUI, scans things for you so you don't have to try to remember complicated settings, and reads hard drives formatted in NFTS. It has a function to share iTunes libraries across the home network. It has a function to make my drive accessible across the internet. Yeah, I was an idiot for not trying the OEM first.<br /><br />So, I'm liking the router a lot more now.  Thanks ASUS!",

This should actually create better air flow and keep the laptop operating a bit cooler. When fully charged, Vista tells me I have around 4 hours and 15 minutes of battery life. I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend this battery.<br /><br />UPDATE: Battery lasted about 3 months. When it is fully charged currently the battery life is around 4 minutes! I retract my recommendation and reduced my 5 stars to 1.",

I absolutely love my Kindle. It is true you can read it in the bright sun light. I have read more books since I got my Kindle.  I also purchased the cover with the reading light in it and I have just one small complaint about the light, the light does not hit all the way to the bottom of the page so it is hard to read the last few lines.  Other than that it is great and a good protector for the Kindle. All in All I think this is the greatest invention since sliced bread.  I give the Kindle FIVE STARS.  Paula from Canada",

But I blame myself for not returning the minute the brand new product gave me issues.<br /><br /> And the software Netgear Genie that comes with it also is useless cause it inaccurately tells me what is going on. It'll tell the internet is connected when it's not. Even more annoying is that when the internet is actually connecting to our wireless devices and laptops, it will constantly tell me it's not and that the wireless is down.  Also it doesn't really assist you in anyway to figure out the problems of it constantly disconnecting.<br /><br />This whole product is garbage and every forum online of people having the same issues I'm having are told that basic functions of the router may be causing the disconnect.  Apparently turning off your security system will help keep it connected. Well that's great Netgear, I'm glad giving all my neighbors access to my internet will help my useless router work better!<br /><br />You'll get better wireless stealing Starbucks free wifi 3 miles down the road.

But the truth is this router almost freeze daily, mostly at night, when it happens, there is no single packet recieved from the wireless router, which means the wireless is completely down, you need to manually restart the router to make it work again.    I am trying to find the possible solution for this problem, you can google \\\\\"wrt54gl freeze\\\\\" or \\\\\"wrt54gl lockup\\\\\" to see how common this problem is, people give numerous suggestions, such as \\\\\"try using tomato or dd-wrt firmware\\\\\", \\\\\"TCP time out tweak\\\\\" or \\\\\"Qos\\\\\", none of these really make sense but I still tried all of these and it does not work. The only one I find may be reasonable is the one [...]/. In short, due to the author, the reason the router freeze is due to a very cheaply maded power supply, so when there is sudden drop of power grid, which is pretty common at night when a lot people using electricity, the router can not get enough voltage and malfunction, thus not a single packet you will recieve from the router.    According to the author, the wrt54g is also affected due to a similar design in router power supply. For $60 router using an outdated broadcom chipset with slow CPU and almost zero function firmware, linksys still want to save pennies from several capacitors of power supply, I really have nothing to say.    ***  Update: I don't know that amazon dose not allow url in user review, if you are interested in the artile about the power supply issue, try google \\\\\"Savel brain dump in English wrt54gl\\\\\".",

I bought this because of the price point and not wanting to spend $600+ for what really amounts to a tech-toy...EPIC mistake.<br /><br />Cons:  Internet browser closes randomly since day one.  Upgrade to ICS turned this into a paper weight for 3 months while ASUS finally sent out enough firmware updates to fix all the problems.  Kudos to ASUS for their tenacity.  Typing on dock is no joy if you are used to a real keyboard, mouse pad continually moves cursor while typing, there is no delete key that I can find (get used to using the backspace), touchscreen is sporadic at best.  Many Android apps are not compatible with this hardware.  Many websites don't display properly, for example...instead of having 7 or 8 items shown horizontally, it will line them all up on the left in two columns  for pages and pages.  Wireless response is slower that iPad (tested between this tablet and wife's iPad).<br /><br />Pros:  Sadly I cannot think of one thing positive to say about this tablet.

Plus I got a set of accessories for free, and rebate (free) on a backpack.

One thing I have to warn you is that this computer is set to \\\\\"hibernate\\\\\" when you close the display panel, meaning that it will shut down. I'm not very familair with notebook computers so I don't know this, and the computer doesn't come with the manual, causing a little frustation trying to solve the problem.

Screen is better than I thought (but maybe not for large 3D games). Speaker is ok, standard.

But if you plan to use it as a desktop replacement, it's looks and feels sturdy enough, and I trust Toshiba, in terms of reliablity.",

I wasn't sure if this was normal for an aftermarket battery, but considering that my OEM battery lasted about three years, I felt disappointed.  UPDATE (May 15, 2016):  I replaced my hdd with a ssd a few months ago, and now my battery works as good as new after two years. Quite odd, but welcome. So I decided to improve my rating. Will it last as much as my OEM battery?  UPDATE (November 3, 2016):  Finally its starting to falter.

I have the C2D P8700 Processor, the 1080P screen (get it, it is SO worth the money!), and the 1 GB graphics card, and the bluray reader. I got a free upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium through Sony. This thing is an entertainment powerhouse. It can play most games I have thrown at it (San Andreas, Oblivion, others) at medium to high settings. The 1080P screen is absolutely gorgeous, with excellent black levels (much better than most competing LED screens can offer, with the possible exception of the RBG LED of the Dell studio XPS 16. The brightness is more than adequate, in a slightly darkened room, the screen must be turned down or it hurts my eyes. Thats a great screen in my opinion.    Despite many of the negative reviews on the keyboard posted here, I feel that this computer has one of the best laptop keyboards I have ever used. It does not feel \\\\\"cheap\\\\\" or flimsy at all to me, and the keys have a nice click to them with no \\\\\"give\\\\\" if pressed quite hard. That said I do have a slightly older model than the one listed, and I hope that Sony has not changed the keyboard out for a flimsier model.    I popped in the Planet Earth Bluray and was blown away by the detail. It looks better on this computer than it ever did on my Sony HDTV.    Complaints: There are very few  1. There is a slight creak that has developed underneath where my right wrist rests on the bottom edge of the computer. This may just be a loose screw, but I haven't had time to open up the bottom of the computer to check it yet.  2. There is a slight amount of wiggle in the top bezel of the LCD. It is not enough to worry me, but it is noticeable when you grip this part of the screen to open the computer. Other than these two minor niggles, I have no complaints about build quality. The outside of this computer (at least the Chocolate Brown model that I purchased) is made of Magnesium not plastic, with a plastic bottom and keyboard.  3. The speakers flat out suck. This is the only truly disappointing aspect of this computer. This thing is so amazing at all things related to multimedia, I cannot believe that Sony would fit such terrible speakers. I have ordered a set of Logitech V20's to put in my bag for when I travel with this computer. Output via headphone is just fine, but don't plan on enjoying bluray-quality sound through the built-in speakers.    Other than these minor complaints, this thing absolutely rocks my world. I am an engineering student, and I rely heavily on this computer day-to-day at school, and it has not let my down. With the extended battery, I see nearly 4 hours of battery life with WiFi on.    Ive done the research, and I don't believe it is possible to get a better quality computer for less money than this. Sony should have called it the FTW.",

After updated all the drivers and software, the keyboard and mouse intermittently drop their connection to my PC.

At times when it drops connections, the PC interprets the last received input and repeats it over-and-over again until a connection is reestablished. This is incredibly frustrating.  The mouse click wheel just doesn't seem to work as flawlessly as advertised. Scrolling down works great, but the scrolling up requires more force than is comfortable for the user.

I need something that will protect my laptop while taking it out of the bag for multiple security checkpoints when traveling. I am a scuba diver and I enjoy underwater video so I also carry in my bag a large housing and hd video camera and I don't want things banging together and getting damaged. I will have to put in an updated review when we get back in a few weeks. The only complaint I could have is that the smell from the product is very strong at first and takes a full day of airing it out. But that will go away... the pattern is also very cute and simple.",

I have a 9600 and this 9500 on two identical PCs at home and I do have a small boost in benchmarks on the 9500.  <br />Apart from having a great GPU, the Tachyon 9500 is great for enthusiasts.  It allows hassle-free overclocking and I might say that the TGM software it includes is incredibly easy to use.  I've been able to overclock at a stable 320MHz core / 600 MHz memory speeds without a sweat. <br />Finally, you get all the video options you'd expect from ATI chipsets, such as great DVD playback and such.<br />I highly recommend this video card to anyone looking for a GPU in this price range.

It is very lightly used and goes from a locked closet to a desk literally two steps away. It isn't put in a bag or transported and isn't even used every day. Within a week the zipper broke. I contacted them and they said they would get back to me with 48 hours. They didn't. I contacted them again and received the same reply. I waited a week and contacted them a 3rd time. This time I didn't even receive a reply. The zipper is broken but the flimsy wrist strap is still attached. Go figure.

They're both within 10 feet of the router. The third computer (unfortunately my main desktop) is located about 30 feet away on the same floor down an open hallway. It's hard to know exactly what's going on because the computer freezes periodically with the desktop card installed. When it doesn't lock up, it has video problems and switches into some God-awful default mode. All three computers are running Windows XP, but my computer is the only one to have these problems. During the brief intervals when I'm actually able to bring up the Belkin wireless networking utility, it either shows the wireless network with minimal signal or the wireless network doesn't show up at all. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, updated drivers, and everything I can think of to no avail. I also have a laptop running the PC card N1 adapter. It works OK but the signal varies between good and poor, again in the same room 30 feet away from the router. Needless to say, this has been a discouraging experience and has soured my impression of Belkin as well as 802.11n. Unfortunately, as I've read reviews of competing products, they all seem just as bad. I think I'm going to break down and run a wire to my bedroom and drop the wireless desktop effort for now.",

Most recently one of the drives has failed and I am hoping that the one left can hold out until I get the replacement drive to repair it.  What I have learned is that if you are operating a NAS it is a good idea to purchase a hard drive that is built to operate 24x7.  This drive may be great for the few hours a day you use a computer but a NAS is always on.  I have moved to a WD Red Drive and I am hopeful I can get more than two years out of it. In the end I am glad I set up my NAS in RAID as I would be out a ton of precious data had I not had a mirrored copy ready.",

The emblem on the back of the laptop was all scratched up. There were fingerprints on the inside of the laptop near the keyboard. And on top of that, there was no clear protective tape to take off over the keyboard/camera lens. After a few hours of use and setup I also realized the right side speaker didn't work, but being that it was Saturday there wasn't much I could do about it.<br /><br />Here's the real kicker. My first move was to contact MSI about the issue with the speaker. Found out through them that this standard warranty doesn't even cover shipping. So the representative from MSI was completely content telling me that the laptop I purchased with a problem would have to be shipped in for repair, and I would have to pay to ship it to them. Pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />This same representative helped me to register the laptop, The serial number on the outside of the box where it instructs you to look didn't work and i had to actually open the battery port to pull it off there. The best part about calling MSI about my problems was that this representative was able to tell me that my serial number had previously already been used to register. So, just as i suspected the minute i started to open this laptop, Amazon had got a hold of this as a return, not fixed it, not properly repackaged it, then they sold it to me as a brand new laptop. Funny part about that is they have a link on this page to see refurbished deals for other MSI products, but i didn't realized i had inadvertently clicked that link. HINT: I DIDN'T<br /><br />Definitely keep your eyes open if you purchase this or anything else from Amazon for that matter. Clearly they think they can get away with selling people damaged and used products advertised as new.<br /><br />I Will say that once I got a hold of customer support the lady didn't question my complaint whatsoever, and I'm supposed to get another &#34;brand new&#34; laptop tomorrow. We'll see about that.",

It's a little larger then the standard dv6000 battery, so it does stick out a little bit making your laptop not sit flush against a table top (not a big issue.) The battery took a couple of hours to charge each time I charged it and got roughly 6 hours of full on gaming time with it. The issue I do have with this battery is I litearlly only got about 4 days out of it. 4th day I had it just shut down while I was using it. Won't start off the battery now and will not charge. I never once charged the laptop with it on, and I've always made sure to drain the battery before charging it to insure it keeps its maximum battery life. When the battery is in and AC cord is plugged in, Windows states it's charging but always remains at 24% life. I have tried several different AC power cords to charge it aswell to no effect. I really was hoping this battery would be fine despite the bad reviews I've read and that maybe people where just getting fluke batteries, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Looks nice, came fast, ran nice and long when it did run, but in the end I'm cutting my loss at the 13$ I spent on this battery.

I fitted it to the existing heat sink, cleaned & re-added the thermal paste and it solved the problem like a champ.<br /><br />One thing I will add is that the fan isn't super easy to get to, or at least not as easy as some online instructions had suggested.  It isn't impossible but it will certainly take a jewelry screwdriver and another one that's just one step bigger (along with a bit of patience) to do the work.  group the screws on a piece of paper and write down where they go!! it's easy to forget which one goes where! I'd also recommend drawing a little caveman sketch of the motherboard to remember where the 4 or 5 cables you unplug go when you re-assemble.  The motherboard will need to be removed from the laptop itself to get at the fan.  I managed to get it all back together with only one surplus screw at the end and everything works fine!<br /><br />Our two options were either pay less than $20 for this fix and add some patience/TLC or buy a new laptop.  This route worked fine and saved us hundreds on a new laptop.",

Battery tip: If i put it to sleep something kills the battery. Overnight it can drop to 10% from a full charge. This was almost disasterous when i had class the following evening and had a full charge the prior night. I found through the forums that if you mute the vol and kill the wifi before putting it to sleep it is fine. I have no idea what sorcery that is but whatever, it works.  I can't tell if its win8.1(it probably is) but it seems buggy. Sometimes the power button will put it to sleep, sometimes it will prompt me to shut down. It can still go to sleep by dragging the right side and selecting Power, but cmon. This shouldn't work inconsistently. Its hard to navigate to commonly used areas like the control panel. Currently my workaround is to hold the desktop background, select Personalize and then go to the top bar and select Control Panel. This area has critical functions that should be accessible easily. I'm sure this us windows doing this so I didn't dock stars for that. Windows apps are lacking pretty severely, android has them well beaten in this. Why I took off stars: Battery life is meh. I've had better, the above trick is what I've done to extend the life. Memory is OK but you won't get the full 32gb, more like 14gb after windows uses its hogshare. Be prepared to get a microsd. Currently HP says you can only upgrade to 32gb. Why does HP restrict the size??? Camera kinda sucks, no clue why such a low resolution when they could have installed far higher ones. I'm not talking prosumer 18mp. Just more than 2mp(if I remember right).  Touch screen. Holy hell I almost threw this tablet against a wall trying to select some text. My motox and 3rd gen iPod must have spoiled me because trying to get a precise area, like between a word to correct a misspelling is a Herculean effort. I just corrected Herculean so easily on my motox, I would have to take a walk around the block to cool off if I tried to do that on the tablet.",

I connected it to a root USB as recommended but still didnt have any good response, My PC is AMD Athlon 64 +3500, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Sata HD, which is more than sufficient to make music or mix, but it didnt work out as planned with the console, i mean i didnt expect the same level of performance with the console as with a real hardware setup, but i must say that it is impossible to work with it since it skips beats on the second track. Tried it for 2 days in diferent computers and didnt work out, Im looking for someone who wants to buy it now. <br />Dont buy it if u plan to rehearse your sets at home, not to say NEVER ever use it to play in a club or party. <br />Why did Hercules make something so appealing and at the same time made it useless using a USB 1 type connection, id rather pay a little more if it had a Firewire port , i think that if this thing would use firewire, there would be no problem at all. <br />One \\\\\"little\\\\\" mistake can make a good piece of hardware totally useless...

When my cable provider switched out my cable modem, my wireless setup \\\\\"broke\\\\\" and I couldn't connnect either to the router using a network cable, and had no internet access at all.  Prior to my cable company swapping out my old modem (because it wouldn't support a higher download speed (which they were charging me for but I wasn't getting), my wireless connectivity using the Linksys router worked fine but wasn't very smooth.  I was completely unable to get my Linksys router to recognize an internet connection using the cable company's RCA modem, so I thought I'd give another router a chance.  Went to Fry's and spotted a Trendnet Wireless-N router on sale for $25 so it came with me back home.      At first, I was unable to get it to talk to my modem either, and I inadvertently reconfigured it with a new password, which it then refused to recognize.  A quick call to Trendnet's tech support quickly straighten me out on how to reset the router back to the factory defaults, and after going through the Trendnet user's manual, instead of using the quick setup guide, it  became apparent to me the problem was the default subnet settting was at 255.255.255.0 while my cable provider had a different subnet value.  No problem in changing the subnet setting in the router software to the correct value,and I had internet connectivity, both wired and wireless.  I was thrilled with the Trendnet router, and it was much faster even using my built-in Wireless-G card in my laptop than before when I was using the Linksys (which refused to accept a new subnet value when I tried to modify the settings).    So, now I was quite curious to get a wireless-N adapter for my laptop to bump up my overall speed.  After reading a ton of reviews of usb and pcmcia adapters from various manufacturers, I thought what the heck I'll try a Trendnet cardeven though some of the other reviews I found weren't that complimentary.  So bought one for $26 including shipping through an Amazon seller, and in 2 days I had the card.  Followed the instructions, installed the software, plugged in the card, and with a very small amount of configuration it worked, but at a transfer rate no faster than Wireless-G (54kbps).  I checked my router settings and it was set to a mixed signal (to accept WirelessB/G/N connections).  I changed the value to only N connections, and the connection speed jumped up from 54kbps to 64kbps.  This was with the laptop within 2-3 feet of the router.  I then carried my laptop across the house, about 25 feet into another room (and didn't turn it off).  Plugged the laptop back into an AC-powered outlet, and tried logging onto CNN.  Took about 20 seconds and the connection worked, and then I checked the speed.  The connection was \\\\\"good\\\\\" but the speed had dropped down to 6kbps.  Whoah...!!  That was bad, very bad.      Moved the laptop back to within a few feet of the router, back to 64kbps.  Now, the card and Wireless-N is supposed to support up to 300kbps, and here I was about 25 feet away getting 6kbps.  That was that, shut down the laptop, pulled the pcmcia card, put it back in it's box, and requested an RMA for a return.  I hope this discourse helps you decide NOT to buy this card.      However, Trendnet does have my total recommendation for their low-cost wireless-N router, it's much better than the Linksys Wireless Super-G router I had previously...",

Please do yourself a favor and get a flash drive that is a little less pretty but actually serves its purpose. You will save yourself A LOT of frustration. I really wish I could get my money back but I missed the time frame for returns :(",

In the days I've had this device I can confirm the inability to open the following file formats on the iPad:<br />.AVI<br />.FLAC<br />.FLV<br />.MKV<br />.MPEG<br />.MPG<br /><br />While one may assume initially this is a deficiency in the iPad iOS as opposed to the \\\\\"MediaShair\\\\\" app; I would point out in response that a similar mediastream product titled: \\\\\"Mediastreamer (by Dane Elec)\\\\\" and it's associated \\\\\"Mediastreamer\\\\\" app can open all the above listed files on the iPad.<br />So, my concern here is what appears to be a deficiency in the \\\\\"MediaShair\\\\\" app for iPad.<br />IF this deficiency in the \\\\\"MediaShair\\\\\" app for iPad can be addressed and updated by the manufacturer, so that all the above listed file formats can be played on the iPad; I implore the manufacturer to make that known because as of this writing (03/28) this device lacks a large file format compatibility.<br />IF such an update is released or made aware of I will ofcourse will give a new rating based on the new update. This lack of file format connectivity is indeed a deal-breaker for me since that is the draw to having an iPad to begin with (a larger screen for video viewing). As of this moment, I am considering returning this device, and contemplating ordering the 5-in-1 RavPower mediastreamer instead.<br /><br />On a positive note this device has excellent connectivity on first connect as well as consistent connectivity (ie. staying connected) while using the device over a significant timeframe with the iPad.<br />Thanks.",

This replacement battery is one fifth the price of an original Apple battery. Batteries apparently don't last foreever, especially if you don't run them down and recharge or recycle.  I didn't. Because the Mac Book will be used mostly powered, it was not critical for me to get an original Apple product.  I was very pleased with the workmanship, fit, and look of this third party replacement.  More importantly it is working fine as a battery, but I have just started using it so I can't assess it long-term qualities.  According to the Apple battery information it will last four hours uncharged, but I have not tested that.  So far I am delighted with the purchase.  Those few times I am not pleased--with other products--Amazon has taken the product back seemlessly.",

Seeing as the \\\\\"original\\\\\" Logitech Illuminated was discontinued I decided to tried the \\\\\"Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750\\\\\" since I thought \\\\\"Surely, Logitech would keep the features that worked and make it even better!\\\\\"  Right?  Wrong!  Unfortunately Logitech threw out what they learnt about thin keyboards.  The Wireless Solar has 2 major design problems:<br /><br />* It feels cheap and flimsy.  The pop-out legs on the back feel like they break with any pressure!<br />* The plastic shape of the keys has the wrong angle on the sides and the top concave angle feels like your fingers never feel like they can \\\\\"just rest naturally at home.\\\\\"<br /><br />Which brings me to the K800...<br /><br />Sadly the K800 has the same broken design as the K750.  The new plastic mold feels cheap and flimsy.  The ergonomics are off due to the wrong concave angle.<br /><br />Does that mean the K800 is wrong for everyone?  No.  What it means is that there are probably 2 camps:<br /><br />* If you loved the original Illuminated Keyboard you probably hated the K750.  You'll probably hate the K800 as well.<br />* If you liked the Solar K750 then you'll probably also love the K800.<br /><br />The one redeeming feature of the K800 is that you are not forced to stay wireless.  You can keep the keyboard plugged in and never worry about losing battery in the middle of a gaming sessions.  If Logitech would take the original and make it a dual-combo wired-wireless and fix their drivers they would have a hit.<br /><br />Why is it so hard to buy an GOOD _wired_ illuminated thin keyboard these days??<br /><br />One of these days Logitech will get around to \\\\\"fixing\\\\\" their keyboard drivers and let you remap a key to any mouse button, offer advanced mapping of the Caps Lock key to any key (without resorting to Windows Registry \\\\\"Hacks\\\\\"), and providing full featured OSX drivers.<br /><br />Until Logitech _understands_ what makes a thin keyboard great I recommend everyone AVOID the K800.  It is garbage compared to the original Illuminated Ultrathin.",

            "input": "The hp mediavault 500GB version was delivered to me yesterday. Because of the following, I'm going to return it:    1. No Mac Support - yes, hp says this product works with mac os x. What they don't tell you (until after you buy it) is that they don't *support* macs. I opened the box and saw the installation cd. I popped it in my mac only to notice that all of the files seemed to be windows files. I rechecked the box for the mac drivers. I scoured the disk, looking for the mac folder. Nothing. I found on one of HP's support pages how you can do a standard \\\\\"connect to server\\\\\" to at least see the drive. Big deal. I could do that with samba for any drive on the network! However, where's the whole \\\\\"back up your whole hard drive\\\\\" option?     Assuming I must have missed something obvious, I finally called HP. To my shock, the tech person told me, \\\\\"We don't support mac\\\\\". He said it as if I should *obviously* know that macs aren't supported. When I read him both amazon's and hp's website indicating that it says, \\\\\"works with both windows and mac\\\\\", he said, \\\\\"oh, it works with mac, we just won't support it.\\\\\" (!!!) I tried to explain to him that that is what's called \\\\\"deceptive advertising\\\\\". I have no problem rsyncing my data. However, it would have gone a LONG way in my decision regarding whether or not to buy this product. If I have to rsync the data myself, why shouldn't I just get an old beat up machine, stick two 500GB drives in them and rsync to that?    2. You don't really have access to the second drive - When I opened the box, the first thing I was curious about was what kind of drive was included with the media vault? Is it western digital, segate/maxtor, or their own drive? So I tried opening the door only to see that I couldn't. Only one door opens; the other is a false door. So when I spoke to the HP tech person, I brought this to his attention. If the extra drive I bought fails, I can replace it. I asked, what happens if the drive that comes with the unit fails? \\\\\"Oh, just return it to HP and we'll put a new drive in and return it to you.\\\\\" I was more specific. \\\\\"What happens if the drive fails beyond the warranty?\\\\\" I was told that in that case, I have to pay. So if you thought you could just pop out the failed drive and stick in a replacement, you can, with one MAJOR caveat. As long as the failed drive is the additional one you bought, you can. If it's the one that comes with the unit, you'll have to ship it back to HP and pay whatever they feel like charging you. Along these lines...    3. You can't pop the drive out yourself and replace it. Well technically you could take the drive out with screwdrivers just like you could any hard drive in any computer. However, the little mini-operating system used to do the mirroring isn't on a ROM chip; it's on the drive that comes with the unit. Furthermore, that mini-os (I think the tech guy said it's a modified linux variant) doesn't get mirrored to the second drive in raid 1. So when the first drive fails, which has the os on it, you have a very heavy paperweight!!! Again, you are forced to go through HP to fix this. HP uses their own os and they don't provide it on their site so you can't just download it, install it on a new drive and pop it in the machine. Once you buy this product, you're married to HP. I don't like that at all!!!    If the problem was just the first point, I would have gladly given this product five stars (assuming everything else worked over at least a couple of months time). But the whole purpose of me having mirrored data in a raid 1 configuration is that if ANY of the drives fail, I pop it out and put in a new one. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT OPTION WITH THIS, ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT MENTIONED ANYWHERE!!!     I'm going to return everything I bought and just put together my own machine dedicated to backing up the network. You've been warned.",

My five year old son does not have a problem with my kindle, however, when he tries to use the one I just bought him, it freezes, and will not download any content.  I spent well over two hours setting the kindles up for my boys for Christmas presents, and it took them all of an hour to lock it up by trying to download extra content.  There are so many kids apps available, that if they touch them, it will try to begin downloading it... Which means if they touch, say five, it will automatically freeze up, turn the WIFI off, and stop working all together.  Since Christmas morning I have had to trouble shoot these things ten times!  It's time consuming and not worth the effort.  I've been looking for a number to call to get help from Amazon so I can lock the apps... That doesn't appear to be an option at this point.

What a mistake that was. Spent 2+ hours filddling with it and another hour with Linksys technical support (mostly on hold). I consider myself pretty good with software, networks, and hardware (going on 10+ years as a programmer) but the WPS11 had me beat. I did manage to get the device installed and configured, I just could not print from any programs on my PC -- I kept getting the error message &quot;The handle is invalid&quot; when attempting to print via the WPS11. That was the problem I called Linsys technical support about. I spoke with two people and the only thing worse than their english was their knowlege of the device and its configuration. Ultimately, I was disconnected (or they hung up on me) without the problem getting resolved. Some observerations: 1) The documentation is terrible. 2) The interface for the two programs you install on your PC to configure and use the print server are clunky and amateurish (not very professional looking). The interface for the web browser accesible program that lets you configure the print server is clunky and slow. 3) In order to get the device to go into &quot;wireless&quot; mode after you unplug the CAT 5 cable, you have to power it down and back up again. That little fact isn't mentioned ANYWHERE in the documentation or on Linksys' web site and it cost me the first of the three hours I spent trying to get this device to work. I gave up on the WPS11 and bought the Netgear Wireless Ready Print Server (PS111W) instead. It requires the seperate purchase of a Netgear 802.11b wireless PCMCIA adapter (MA401) but it was the right decision. Crisp, very clean looking configuration software and less than 10 minutes to install. Works like a champ - wish I had tried the Netgear first.",

No joke 8 hours easy on this thing with light office work, even with screen brightness turned up<br /><br />-Compact power cord<br /><br />-Sturdy<br /><br />-Speakers are pretty good, but hey, it is a laptop so no high expectations there<br /><br />-TRACKPAD is multitouch, just like a macbook! This is so essential!<br /><br />-Price, got it for $600 at Best Buy. Worth more like $900.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Like I said, the screen is pretty good but nothing to shout about.<br /><br />-When you are first initializing the set up, make sure you don't accidentally partition the hard drive like I did, that is the default option, I don't know how to get it back.<br /><br />********UPDATE****<br />So after a few months with the machine I still quite like it, however I have noticed a few things. More and more I have notice how washed out the screen looks, the colors just do not pop. I do not know if this is common with mid-range laptops, it certainly pales in comparison to a macbook pros screen and my cheap LCD TV.<br />Also, the amazing 8-9 hour battery life that I was raving about has already dropped to 5 hrs in a matter of 3 months. Again, don't know if that is common, but I miss being able to go all day without the power cord.<br /><br />*****UPDATE*******<br />last summer this laptop fell out of our car and got pretty banged up. Bought a MacBook Air off of amazon for $800 and have never looked back. Iknow it's a bit more money, but everything about it is superior, highly recommend it. Screen is much better, crazy thin, and ssd just screams. And this is a 2011 model. I bought it used and apple still put a 1 yr warranty on it.",

By the time I finally had the funds to purchase the warranty, it said that I was no longer qualified to purchase it. The 30 day time frame to purchase beginning with the delivery date (not the activation or registration of the Kindle) is completely ridiculous, especially when considering some people receive their Kindles as gifts and therefore don't have the entire 30 days to purchase. I took my issue to Amazon, and all I got out of it was more information that I already knew - like that there is a one year warranty included with the Kindle anyway, and that you have thirty days to buy this one. Not helpful. I expected a bit more understanding and better customer service on this one, but I guess since it's a third party providing the warranty this is the sort of inflexibility you can expect if anything goes wrong with your order.

Using an external USB DVD drive the install went smoothly. After logging on for the first time installed driver software and connected to the internet and installed updates. I tried some HD youtube video and it seemed to play ok but still wasn't great. I previously emailed Shuttle Support and asked about using the Broadcom BCM970015 mini-PCIE card for better hardware video decoding. I was told it should work but there is no way of knowing for sure because they haven't tested it. I then did some research and found a newer video driver directly from intel that improved the video playback. I was even able to play 1080p video file that looked great. I also didn't like the wifi network card's performance. So I dug out a card I had previously purchased (Intel\u00ae Dual Band Wireless-N 7260 Plus Bluetooth4.0). That card was designed with newer chipsets in mind but works flawlessly in the XS35V2. There is the possibility that newer Wireless-AC cards will work as well and they are fairly cheap. I will look at installing another wifi antenna in the future as it only has one built in. I will be purchasing a couple of USB TV tuners soon and then installing XBMCBuntu for the main OS+DVR/Media Player. I would really love to be able to install Android on this. I believe these little machines would be great as Google TV/Android TV devices. The only thing it is missing is HDMI out. I will be purchasing a VGA to HDMI dongle sometime soon. Upon opening it up to look at the internals. Mainly to check how the second HDD will connect when I purchase the adapter. It looks as if they could have actually made these to possibly support an MXM Graphics Module upgrade. If manufactures would do something like that with their systems they could make a base system then charge extra for a video &#34;card&#34; upgrade similarto a full size desktop.",

I bought it in September and have tried to calibrate it, but I've now decided this is just a poorly designed product. Unfortunately I've spent too long trying to get it to work, and I'm now past the return period, so Amazon won't let me return it either.<br /><br />Here are the reasons I have to give it one star:<br /><br />1) The colors looked washed out and dim initially. I spent $180 on the X-Rite CMUNDIS ColorMunki Display calibrator. After calibrating several times, the monitor still doesn't look right.<br /><br />2) The buttons on the bottom of the screen are ultra sensitive. They don't even need to be pushed. If you just brush up against them, they are activated, and you can accidentally switch color profiles without noticing. They right underneath the monitor on the right side, so it's in a place you are always reaching on your desk, and it's easy to push them accidentally. My kids have accidentally pushed them many times too. Now every time I sit down to edit pictures, I'm paranoid that the color scheme has changed, and I have to re-check it each time!<br /><br />3) The monitor wiggles slightly on the stand.

I have been a long time amazon customer and purchase from them because use to think they valued their customers\u2026 not so much anymore. I have loyally purchased kindles since they first emerged on the market. This was my 3rd personal Kindle (I've bought them for my mom and sister as well) and this will be my last purchase. I purchased my kindle in July 2013 and by February of 2014, it increasingly stopped holding a charge. I continued to use my Kindle and finally by May, I was unable to use my kindle for more than 15-30 min. without it being plugged in. Not very convenient. I called customer service and they had me wipe and reinstall the software. It still didn't work. So I called and they said they would replace my kindle. The online invoice indicated that the condition of the replacement kindle was &#34;new&#34;. However, when it arrived, it had a refurbished sticker on the box.<br /><br />I spent $250 on my kindle when i purchased it. Refurbished models are now valued at $150. I had to call Amazon twice to address this issue. The first time I called Amazon to complain and ask why they were trying to replace a $250 kindle with a $150 one, as well as giving me a refurbished unit instead of a new one. They told me they no longer make the model and had to replace it with a refurbished unit. I asked to speak with a manager because I didn't believe that this was appropriate given the expense of the item and was told a manager would call me back. Two weeks later and no call from Amazon, I called again. Again I was given the run around and offered a $20 credit that I guess was suppose to make up for the additional $100 my original kindle was worth versus their replacement.<br /><br />As I explained to Amazon,<br />1) I could have bought a refurbished model in the first place if that was what i wanted. I didn't. So why would I want a refurbished model now.<br />2) Maybe your warranty does allow you to replace a model with refurbished unit but just because you can doesn't mean you should. That's not good customer service. Who wants to spend $250+ in July to have that item break within 6 months and then get a used replacement?<br />3) Why are you telling me you don't make the item anymore and can only give me a refurbished unit when you are still selling them new online for $229???<br />4) Why are you sending me an invoice stating that the replacement is &#34;new&#34; when the package clearly states its refurbished.<br />5) How is the fact that this refurbished model is under warranty suppose to make me feel any better about it being a replacement for a new model that only worked for 6 months\u2026 Yes, I want to spend my time on the phone with Amazon replacing this unit as well.<br /><br />This is why people buy Apple products. They break you take them to the store and they replace them or upgrade them, no questions asked.  Amazon didn't want to give me the next version of the HD 7 which is valued at the same price I paid. That's just cheap. Who losses out in this scenario? The customer.<br /><br />Not only do I buy the kindle, but I buy movies, apps, textbooks and ebooks, exclusively from Amazon, and what do I get in return for my customer loyalty and hard earned money????  A refurbished Kindle and $20 to spend on Amazon.That's like your parents giving you money to buy them a present. Well, Amazon may be convenient but the customer service is sub par. I think I've spent enough money on Amazon to warrant a little loyalty from them and a lot better customer service<br /><br />Its only a bargain if you can afford it and I can't afford to spend $250 on something that only works for 6 months and is then going to be replaced with something that is worth half as much. That sounds too much like a scheme to me. This was my last Amazon purchase. I'd rather drive to a store than feel cheated.",

For work it's not enough to read PDFs, you need to highlight, make notes, and be able to export and share annotations with co-workers and archive them on you computer or other devices for future reference. The EE does all this and much more. The e-ink screen is large enough to view full sized PDFs with only minor reduction in size. Plus, since the margins are adjustable, you can have some flexibility to increase the size without having to zoom, which it also does well.     Taking handwritten notes is fantastic. The note-taking experience feels and looks almost as good as paper. You might want to get an additional wacom pen though, since the one that comes with the device is pretty skinny. While working on documents you can add links to other PDFs, files, or websites within the document at relevant points. The tablet side makes it easy to organize and upload documents to read and annotate. With the library, you can organize all your work under different tags. For classes I have all the readings for the class, as well as a journal document under the same tag. The journal is my class notebook. Switching between the PDF and journal functions is done with a single click. You can create different tabs in your journal that act like separators in a notebook. This creates a table of contents for the journal so it's easy to see and navigate between different topics. This is all I take to class now. It's also my indispensable companion at conferences and in the field.     I've also recently been making great use of the audio recorder, which takes very clear recordings of interviews, even in meetings with ten or more people around the table. I can record and take notes, check things on the web all at the same time. And I can work all day on a single charge.     With Dropbox on the tablet, this device is linked up with the work on my computer, saving tons of time and just making everything easy. I've been looking for years for a way to annotate scholarly articles without going blind staring at a backlit LCD screen for hours at a time. The e-ink screen makes an enormous difference. It may not be as slick as some of the LCD-only tablets, but there's no comparison in terms of the reading experience.     If you're looking for a lightning fast, slick device for playing around, there are probably other options that would be more impressive. If you're looking for something with incredibly smart and practical design meant to make your life easier as a juggler of endless documents, the edge is really still unbeatable.

I am not much of a directions guy, but was extremely pleased with how easy this was to set up and how intuitive it was when it came to setting it up. I've got 1 workstation, 2 netbooks, and 2 laptops that backup wirelessly to this guy. If they are already on the same wireless network, it's simply a matter of clicking the 'add computer' button. There's no need to fuss with any of the backup settings unless you are particular, as it will do the work automatically for you. You can then either access your files via the console or remotely at your convenience.    I can't stress enough how nice and convenient it is to be able to centrally access all my files without having to shuffle files back and forth between the local hard drives and having piece of mind knowing it's being backed up automatically. I previously did this with Time Capsule which while it worked at times, was tempermental and slow. I'm not sure how well this will work on Mac, but I am running various flavors of XP and Vista in 32bit and 64bit configs.    I even decided to add another storage drive (Seagate Barracude 1.5tb 7200rpm)for redundancy. Adding storage was a simple as pulling out an open drive bay, popping in the new drive, then going into the management console to click through the add storage wizard which took less than a minute. Now I've got 2.6tb's of storage, more than I'll probably ever need and 2 open bays to expand down the road.",

I had the original version and it lasted me 5 years working smoothy to keep my CPU cool, always in 30C's idle and loaded at 45 to 48C's.  This new one is so much quieter and is keeping the temperatures in the 30C's ad idle and in the 40C's fully loaded as well. So what's the difference between old and new Hydro H60?  I can run the fan on Turbo setting which is quieter than the older Standard speed (I like quiet).  Plus - a big plus. The bracket for AM sockets, in my case AM3 and AM3+ is so easy to install compared to the older model.  All you need do is put the bracket over the top of the Cooler and a magnetic attachment holds it in place while you tighten the fasteners by hand until the cooler is snug on the processor. Nothing more to do for us AMD enthusiasts.  The AM sockets have the two catches for the regular fans to fit over then tighten up.  The same catches are all you need for the Hydro H60 bracket for snugging up the cooler to the processor.  Outstanding Corsair!!  I have Corsair Looped Cooling in two rigs and Corsair Memory and Corsair PSU.  Yep, big fan of Corsair.  Kudos for upgrading the H60 to take on moderate to extreme overclocking with the Athlon, Phenom and FX series processors. Other upgrades to the H60. Impressive larger hoses and a much sturdier built cooler/pump module.",

All of the highs and lows are rich and distinguishable as well which is very important.  I have seen people complain of a hiss issue. The most common cause is old audio cables or having your mp3 player on a usb charger while playing music. This goes for any stereo or pair of headphones. It is not the speakers, it is your setup. It may also be the quality of mp3 you have on playback. Anything lower than 192k in quality and you will hear a loss in audio quality.  Logitech makes nothing but quality products. Call me a fanboy if you will. I have a range of their products including remotes, wireless keyboards, mice, and now 2 sets of speakers.

Seriously, I wouldn't think twice about loading this thing to 60 lbs.<br /><br />Attention to detail is perfect.  Love the straps; they're so comfortable, and adjusting them while wearing it is so easy, I was laughing the first time I tried it.

It saved my profile without me doing a thing or installing software again after I re-installed Windows 7 fresh & new, in the mouse itself, so I didn't have to set everything up again. That made me very happy. Setting up all the buttons to do your bidding is a piece of cake & once you are using it & remembering you have all these buttons, you'll realize you don't know how you ever were without them! It feels lovely in the hand, battery lasts quite a while & even though I don't use it for gaming, I'm sure it would absolutely be awesome in that case (I used to game a lot). I love it for navigating & stuff like Photoshop & the like.<br /><br />I set mine up so the back & forward button do the usual, in the usual place, while G6 is undo, G7 is ctrl, G8 is alt, G9 is shift & the last two are copy and paste functions, which just rock my socks a lot of the time. I spend pretty much every waking hour on my computer, so it's made a huge difference.<br /><br /> My one beef with the thing is the horrible, absolutely dreadful texture of the plastic thumb rest & around the rest of the mouse areas besides the palm & buttons. It drives me insane, it's this rough, terrible texture that drives my OCD (no, not the stereotypical kind, it's different) crazy & sometimes I can't even handle touching it. However, I do believe it's like that because of the fact it is a gaming mouse & the thought behind it is likely them wanting to prevent slippage from sweaty hands during hardcore gaming sessions, so a lot of those who are interested, I'm sure it's perfect for you. I do think they could have used a different material/texture, though & still achieved the same result. It doesn't lose any points for this, since this is most likely a plus for gamers & the mouse is intended for gaming, not to mention this is mostly a personal preference/issue. It's fantastic & you shouldn't hesitate. I only hesitated because I hate Logitech & didn't want to buy another product of theirs again. I'm glad I went through with it, especially considering the hassle I was going through trying to find something that would be just right for me. This was a bit higher than my price range, but it had everything I wanted & needed in a mouse, & I thank me every day for having gone through with it! :)<br /><br />Battery compartment is very easy to deal with, set-up is quick, painless & easy, battery life is good, reaction time seems good (though I haven't tried it in a really necessary environment for that), the two battery consumption options are awesome, buttons are all easy to access & react quickly to your press, the scroll wheel is ok, and something that makes me pretty happy is the off & on switch on the bottom, which really is necessary, I think, especially when you want to do something like wipe the mouse down with something & don't want it to click a bunch of stuff in the process, among a bunch of other reasons. So do it! Buy the mouse already! (oh and btw, I absolutely love the USB extension cord, which I am using for my 4-port hub instead, actually, & the range is pretty good as far as I know for the mouse, but I never need to go further than a foot or so from it anyways, so this might be the one area I have no knowledge about)",

Most of the time it occured during disk I/O and the HD light would be stuck on. I'm already on the latest firmware (.22), running all the proper Intel SATA drivers, and locking the drive to operate in SATA2 to match the laptop but neither of these actually improve anything.<br /><br />After struggling with it for about 2 weeks, I replaced it with Kingston V200+ SSD and magically it hasn't even freeze once. The OCZ drive will go back to OCZ for a warranty replacement and then I might try in on my desktop PC instead.<br /><br />Update:<br />I've reached out to Tech Support via there forum. They are prompt and responsive and suggested changing the ACHI Link Power Management setting. This requires some registry addition, removal, tweaking, and deleting of Intel 7 Series SATA driver and force use Microsoft's. It's going to take a few days to see whether it help.<br /><br />Either way, I have to give two thumbs up for their support team.",

Are there disadvantages to the Kindle?  Of course.  But most are minor and of no real concern.  When faced with the advantages versus the disadvantages,  I'll take the Kindle every time.

Otherwise, a good 9/10 times the laptop will \\\\\"Blue Screen\\\\\" and crash. Even when shutting down my laptop it crashes.    Reliability also leaves much to be desired as I have experienced, as well as co-workers who also puchased this product, the connection mysteriously disconnecting even though the access point is a reasonable distance away through standard dry wall.    I contacted Hawking Technical Support and they passed blame onto the USB controller Dell used in the laptop and did not seem genuinely interested in fixing the problem as was shown through slow/non-existent response to e-mail inquiries and canned answers. The drivers available for Download on Hawking's site have been marked \\\\\"Final Version\\\\\" for months now.    Because of my experience with this and its sister product (Cardbus version), I will not be buying Hawking products again since they cannot be trusted to actually support and maintain them.",

I thought to myself, &#34;wow, that looks like a tough cable.&#34;  So, as soon as it arrived, I pulled it out of the box and started wrapping it around my fingers and pulling on it.  :)  Well, &#34;pulling&#34; is a bit light of a word for what I was doing.  Guess what?  It really is a tough cable.  I love it.<br /><br />I didn't get this for the lightning plug, so I've only used the Micro USB portion.  As should come as no surprise, that part works great.  It's difficult to mess up a Micro USB cables these days.  It's also pretty darn easy to separate the lightning adapter from the Micro USB plug.  The one thing that I wished this had, but it's not nearly enough reason to dock it a whole star, is an adjustable bumper stop near that end of the cable to keep that adapter piece from sliding (conceivably) all of the way to the USB plug side.  That adapter has nothing to stop it from sliding down the cable as it is.  While not as elegant, you could always wrap just a little bit of tape around a spot a little distance from the adapter end to make it thicker in that area and keep the adapter from sliding much.<br /><br />The flat nature of the cable is pretty cool, IMO, but it does mean that curling it up like in the photos is easier than bending it into loops like you'd normally do with a round cable to reduce the size and pack it somewhere.<br /><br />I want to reiterate just how tough that flat cable is.  It's super well made as far as I can tell.  The end connectors are nothing fancy, but they're made well enough.  It comes with plastic caps for each end, too.  I admit that I never thought about abusing my round wire USB cables before, but even after trying that out on this cable, I'm not willing to do that to most of the ones that I own - they just don't seem nearly as well made.  Granted, they were much less expensive and often came included with some other product.  Which brings me to this point - yes, this is an expensive cable at the current $15 price.  It's more expensive than other cables.  However, it's super tough.  Mine also, as odd as this is to either experience or mention, smells like berry candy.  Me likey.  :D<br /><br />So, if you just want a cable and are gentle on your gear, you may not want to pay the price premium for this.  However, if you want something rugged, then I do recommend giving this some consideration.  For shear toughness, this is my favorite cable.  For shear coolness, I will point out the [[ASIN:B00UB9NG74 DATASTREAM Blue LED Flowing Current Micro USB Cable]] if you don't need the lightning plug.  While both have a price premium, I don't think you'll be disappointed in either.they were much less expensive and often came included with some other product.

That concerned me because I am super-sensitive to smells.  I ordered the cover before I have ordered the Touch Kindle and am very glad that I did.  The cover is very attractive and well made.  I believe the odor comes from whatever was used to put the two fabrics together.<br /><br />Now to go to how I have eliminated/minimized the odor! In the bottom of a 39-gallon size leaf plastic bag, I placed a garden bench, the kind that can be flipped over to kneel on.  It fit in the bag perfectly!  On the bottom of the bag underneath the bench, I placed a 1-quart size glass measuring cup filled with white vinegar 5% acidity.  On top of the bench I placed the cover, open and resting up to stand, looking like a V.  Carefully gather the top of the leaf bag using a long twister to close.  Once or twice a day, take the cover out and let stand to get air for about an hour or so.  Then place back into the bag.  This procedure can take 3 to 4 days until the smell becomes agreeable to you!  I just did a sniff test!!  Odor hardly noticeable!  I am so happy!<br /><br />August 27th: I seem to be mostly a lap reader!  I want to add that the COVER IS NON-SLIP.  It does not move even when my legs are crossed!",

I've found trying to press on this thick \\\\\"thumb bump\\\\\" boot to push on the tab difficult to use and sometimes I have to pull the boot back in order to press directly on the tab to properly disengage it.  It seems these generic boots are just too large and may actually be pressed up against the jack housing causing tension on the jack and making disengagement harder (hence my need to peel back the boot or forcibly push the cable further into the jack to unload the tension on the tab).    Which is why I now use the Cables-To-Go snagless versions as it uses a light and small vinyl flap that rests on the plastic locking tab to aid in disengaging yet allows easy unobstructed view and access to this tab to ensure you are properly disengaging it without adding any stress or tension to the connection.",

I asked if they were telling me that they're product could not handle a car ride and was told basically, yes. The tech also put most of the blame on Amazon for they're product's crappyness. But to be on the safe side they're going to mail me a disk to try and re-boot the computer. I will receive this in five to eight business days!     I expressed to customer support how upset I was with their product's quality. Then he asked where I purchased my new $661.00 boat anchor and I informed him Amazon. That is when Acer told me I would have been better off if I had purchased this computer from Wal-Mart.com because I could bring it back to the store and have it replaced ASAP. I was shocked to hear that a company that deals with Amazon would recommend I purchase their product from one of Amazon's competitor's.    I called Amazon and they're shipping me another one of these wonderful machines. I can't wait to see how long the new one works for until, it too is taken out by a car ride or a gentle breeze.    So either way I spent over 600.00 and now have to wait five days plus until I can have access to a computer again. I'm not sure I even want this replaced, and according to the manufacturer, I should shop else where to begin with! What a wise purchase this was!    Update:  So it took four weeks for the new on to start acting up. It shuts it self off, even when plugged in. I called Acer, they told me they had no idea what was wrong with it. Ican't say enough about the terrible customer service that Acer has, they really would not be bothered. Amazon has agreed to refund my purchase and that what I plan on doing. So after five weeks and two computers I stand by my statement, this computer is PURE JUNK!",

So nothing was ever read by me about HAVING to return my old Kindle, nor did the representative mention that.<br /><br />In my mind I purchased the first Kindle and it was MY property!

My review is both about Vaio product quality in general, and the Sony customer service/repair process. I am posting it on Vaio products to alert other consumers what customer service level they can expect when they buy a Vaio.<br /><br /> The screen on my unit had the backlight fail after a few months of use. I have had Sony repair it three times. Each time they returned it, it still had the same problem. After the third time, I gave up on Sony and purchased a comparable ASUS notebook, which has worked perfectly.<br /><br /> The reason why I have given 1/5 stars is because Sony was inefficient, rude, and downright dishonest about their \\\\\"repair\\\\\" process. Only once out of three times did they get the shipping box, repair process, or return process done in the turnaround time they promised. At no point did they actually repair the laptop!<br /><br /> After receiving the still defective laptop back for the third time, I called their service center in Laredo Texas and asked what they had done to repair it. They told me that the internal cable for the screen had never been properly connected, and they plugged it in. I asked if that meant it was repaired, and was told by the representative that they were unable to commit that the laptop had been repaired or would be functional. Out of the 2 months I spent dealing with Sony, this was one of the few honest statements they made: My laptop is still as useless as the day I first called their tech support.<br /><br /> I will never purchase another Sony product as a result of this experience, and to anyone that buys a Vaio: Hope that it works perfectly. Otherwise, Sony will take it from you for 12-20 days (not the 10 they promise) and then return it to you still broken -- 3 times in a row.",

I wrote this review for the Black and Clear variants of the case, but I just got the blue one for another iPad and thought I should share my similar thoughts on it as well.<br /><br />The question becomes how much protection does your iPad need, and what do you want to do it?  I had a folio-type case before, but it's a little bulky and if you enjoy gaming, it makes it hard to do things like accelerometer based games.  I also tried a sticker-skin-type protector to protect the back from scratches, but it doesn't do much for the edges or corners.<br /><br />Finally I settled on a [[ASIN:B005GOINEK Just Air Case for Ipad - Black (8271)]] and a naked iPad 2 except for a sticker on the back.<br /><br />When I bought my iPad 3, I wanted better protection, and the Amzer Silicone Jelly Skin provides it.<br /><br />It is the pinnacle of simplicity.  It's a nice thick silicone rubber skin that stretches around the entire iPad.  There are a few other similar products, but this one seems to be the best.  Installation is easy - stretch it like a rubber band and it holds tight to the device.  This case is a deep blue color, not translucent but a solid blue, and the color looks very sharp with the iPad under it.  My other iPad uses a black Amzer Jelly Skin for a more professional look.  The Blue is fun, but not so bright that you couldn't use it for work as well.<br /><br />Unlike other skins, it wraps around the edges and also covers the screen frame in the front.  The screen is not blocked, but the extra lip provides protection from falls directly on the screen.  As the case provides no other screen protection (and I don't like protective screen-stickers), this is a useful feature.<br /><br />The case features rubber buttons over the volume and power switch, along with cut-outs for home, mute, cameras, microphone, speaker, power port, and headphone jack.  I have a charging cradle for my iPad that holds it in portrait mode - the Amzer Jelly Skin is a little too thick for the iPad to properly dock, but I'm not too surprised.  I'll just using the charging cable instead, but just remember it won't likely fit in a cradle with this Jelly Skin in place.  The only weak spot in the case is the hole for the \\\\\"home\\\\\" key - it's a little thin and doesn't lie perfectly flat.<br /><br />The other great part about the case is that while it is thick enough to provide protection, it is thin enough to still put it inside my [[ASIN:B005GOINEK Just Air Case for Ipad - Black (8271)]] for travel.  The neoprene sleeve protects the screen while inside my briefcase, and the Amzer silicone skin provides enough protection while I hold just the iPad.

I don't know what's happening with Amazon's customer service, but it seems it's going in the toilet. I went back online to chat with customer service, and they still will not stand by their product and want to now charge me $125.00 for a Fire HD. This is obviously THEIR problem with their product and I'm just not willing to pay full price for another crappy Kindle product.",

Here's my story.<br /><br />I originally had a Blackwidow Ultimate keyboard with an Imperator as my mouse, but because I play a good deal of MMOs, I wanted to get the Naga for all of its buttony goodness. The mouse itself is well built, feels sturdy, has a lovely grip for the ring finger, and a rubber pad for the pinky if you like a claw-style grip, but the software is unusable.<br /><br />1. Synapse updates all the time. Every other day it seemed to have an update, and would incessantly nag you until you applied it. Many of these updates required restarts.<br /><br />2. At random intervals, the mouse would stop tracking movement. This would occur on a fastidiously clean, just booted up PC with no other nonsense in the background other than system and peripheral drivers. Unplugging the device and replugging in would do nothing. Updating firmware did nothing. The worst part was that it was random; there was no way to predict when this would occur.<br /><br />3. The Synapse software broke my keyboard. Keys would fail to press, ghost keys would be repeated, and once again, it was random.<br /><br />Removing the Software fixed all of these bugs. I will be going back to my original setup of the legacy drivers on the Blackwidow Ultimate and Imperator. The extra buttons are not worth all of this hassle. As long as Razer insists on using this Synapse 2.0 nonsense, I will not be supporting them by purchasing their products.",

The only thing extra you get with the CinemaGo is the wireless dongel. It is essentially completely useless. The dongle is garbage. The fact that they packaged such a piece of junk with a media player whose primary purpose for existing is to play HD video is pretty much criminal. This is probably one of the worst wireless dongles on the planet. Forget HD video. You won't even be able to watch standard non-HD files without some lag.     The file copy feature through the dongle is also worthless. It's buggy and slow beyond comprehension. And you can't use any other functions of the unit while it's copying. So if you want to attach a hard drive and just copy a file wirelessly to compensate for the inability to play files over the network, enjoy waiting hours for for the file copy process to complete... as opposed to just taking the hard drive in the other room and copying it via usb in a few seconds.    The \\\\\"extra\\\\\" internet features such as torrents... worthless. It's so slow and limited you won't even take it seriously. The internet radio is nothing special. Tons of the stations don't play and you can just get them on the net for free anyway.    And to top it all off, in order to get this thing to connect to your Windows 7 machine, you have to go into the registry and manually change security settings to allow for anonymous password free guest access to your machine. The best possible security settings. Great job!    As for the unit itself... it's pretty good for playing most files. It's very buggy though. Also, you'd think they frequently update software to allow for various codec changes, etc. Not the case. This thing can't even play files with the flv extension. Oh, it can play flv files. If you rename them to mp4 or whatever, they'll play just fine. It's simply the flv EXTENSION that it has a problem with. And the support team can't fix that. Great job! Not to mention it can't play mkv files with header removal compression. Something easily fixed. But they can't seem to get it done at Brite-view. So you'll have to use software to edit the mkv header compression yourself.    Honestly, I thought the biggest benefit to buying this unit would be software updates as needed. Boy was I naive. Anyway, as it is, this unit is way overpriced for buggy performance with non existent wireless functionality... even though the video quality is quite good.    ------------------  2010-11-29 update  ------------------    And now that piece of junk dongle is fried. Stopped working. I know what you're saying.... why do you care? It was a piece of worthless junk to begin with. True! But at the end of the day it did have at least one function. And that was to do software updates. That's the only functionality it had and apparently THAT was too much for it as it died after a month. We'll see how Brite-view customer support handles this issue. I will report back with an update.    ------------------  2010-12-14 update  ------------------    Well, this thing with all it's malfunctioning and defective parts is complimented by a customer support staff that is completely absent and disinterested. I've contacted them multiple times. All they say is that they forward the request to the RMA department and that's it. You never hear from them again. Horrible company. Cheap device. What a mistake buying this thing was. I'm buying the Patriot Box Office and hopefully my credit card company will refund me for this lousy defective purchase.    ------------------  2010-12-27 update  ------------------    This company is horrible. I contacted them to replace the defective dongle. They emailed telling me they would forward it to their RMA department. Didn't here form them again. I contacted them again about it, expressed my displeasure and asked to return the device and get a refund altogether as the whole thing is buggy and malfunctioning. They told me they'll forward the request to the RMA. Never heard from them again. This company is a joke. Do yourself a favor and do not buy anything from this company.      ------------------  2011-01-21  ------------------    They promised to replace the dongle. Never happened. They even commented here that the dongle has been sent out. Never got it. Never heard back from customer support or the RMA department. Very buyer beware with this bush league small time company.",

The Cisco support site search was totally useless.<br /><br />Why Cisco only supports 11 drives is beyond me.  Everybody else seems to support whatever you plug in to a USB port.  Pretty sloppy engineering - \\\\\"Doesn't work - declare it incompatible and move on.\\\\\"<br /><br />The router is very sneaky.  If you plug in a Cisco untested USB drive, it may connect and look like everything is fine.  Then BOOM, it crashes and the router goes into a re-boot loop, taking down your whole network.  Then when you disconnect the drive you find out that the file structure has been corrupted and you need to run CHKDSK or in one case, the Linux disk repair utility.<br /><br />When you try to use the Cisco support web site, be sure to turn off your pop-up blocker;  just about everything you do requires a pop-up.  And be careful of the Live Chat, one false move and it disconnects and clears itself in mid-chat.<br /><br />Maybe Cisco should have spent more time on making the router work instead figuring out how to make it supportable from the Internet (which they had to back off from later after people found out that all of their traffic was being monitored by Cisco.)<br /><br />Usually I check user reviews before I buy something like this, however, I was in the middle of exchanging a Netgear router with a dead wireless radio and didn't have time.

They pretend they can't imagine such a thing as a hard drive not accepting a connection and just disappearing like that.  Level two (they asked me to call back the next day) tried harder,  but same result.  I spent a total of 9 hours on the phone over three days with them (mostly phone tree and holding)  had my calls dropped THREE times and had to start over,  just very,  very frustrating.<br />So..............they tell me to send it back (data and all,  which will be forever lost),  and they will send me a 're-certified'  unit,  which is all the warranty will allow according to them.  I didn't buy re-certified unit,  but now I am supposed to thank them for that because 'it has been gone through'  and the techs make sure everything is right.<br />No they don't.  What I got was a repackaged USED unit with scratches and dust in the vents.  It had a power supply that was for some other unit,  some other country and not only wouldn't plug into the unit itself,  it also wouldn't plug into a U.S. power outlet.<br />You can't trust this product,  and I think people should know that.  You also can't trust the company's very slack customer service. But my biggest beef is this:  after they put a customer through all of that hell,  they still INSIST that they only will give you a used unit to satisfy their phony-baloney warranty.  Yes,  I read the fine print.  If they had allowed an ordinary consumer to know that they would forever get used units as replacement,  I doubt people would buy the new unit in the first place.  So they hide it.<br />I didn't buy a used unit.  I expect a new one in exchange when the first one fails so soon and so miserably.<br />I'm  on my third one,  and I honestly don't think it's going to be any better.

It is not an alienware, but for the price, what were you expecting?  The Toshiba M-645 S4118x provides one of the best portable all-around laptops. It easily runs any professional software that one might wish to use.  I have used Revit Architecture 2012, and it works fairly well, though I might need to add another 2 gb of ram (comes with 6 gb standard with 8 gb capacity).    It includes all sorts of aspects for anyone needing performance: a Blu-ray player, GeForce GT525M, Wireless-N card, Bluetooth,a USB 3.0 port, and Harmon Kardon Speakers.  The Blu-ray drive is decent, but when mirroring to a display unit such as your television, I think Blu-ray content can only be supported on one display (so the movie will not show on your laptop LCD and external display simultaneously).  There may be a way around this limitation, but I really do not need that feature.  Also, I believe the video card can output external content on a 3D display with Nvidia 3D Vision or other software.  I am not sure about the limitations on 3D display models as I have not used this feature yet.  The wireless networking card works well.  I have not used the USB 3.0 port, but I hear it is super fast.  I have to admit the Harmon Kardon speakers are amazing.  They are not super loud, but the quality for laptop speakers is excellent.    The laptop comes with some bloatware, but some people may find it useful.  The only downside to all this power is the meager battery, which has usually lasted me about 3 hours on normal performance operations.  There is an optional battery, but it would have been better to include it in the first place.  Another downside is the the lack of gigabit ethernet.  I really don't need the feature, but it is useful for home network set-ups for high transfer speeds.  There are not enough negatives to lower the rating, though.    I conclusion, I recommend this machine as a casual gamer and college student, because it has great performance for the price.  No problems so far, and I hope the laptop will last for awhile.",

It seemed to work but was taking forever, so I grabbed both sections of the cover and tossed them in my bath tub.  I let them soak in very hot water for a few minutes, and pulled the first one out, which felt pretty limp like a noodle.  I drained the water off (gave it a few swings to clear the water from the channel) and laid it on the floor to cool off and dry with some heavy items pinning down both ends, same with the second.    The heat \\\\\"reset\\\\\" the rubber a bit, and letting it cool while sitting flat locked it in nicely.    Since then, both of the covers have worked flawlessly.    Using wide strips of 3M double sided foam tape has helped keep them very flat and very much locked into place.",

For depth they are about right for a business card so that only a tiny bit peeks our.  For width, because they run the entire length of the case split in half, they are very large.

I have the habit of putting the device in case and the case in a sleeve, for extra protection.  I have rather destructive cats, so I get a bit paranoid about these things.<br /><br />The little snap strap can swing in front of the device blocking the screen, and it can get a bit annoying sometimes.

They are gone the way of 3.5 inch floppy disks. <br /> <br />I got it set up but it took me about anhour and a half of wasted time.  If you skip the standard setup procedure and go directly to WiFI setup (hard to see in the startup window due to very low color contrast) you can configure your SSID and security settings.  There remains the problem configuring the network settings.  Only because I have set up several other routers did it occur to me to direct a browser to 192.168.1.1.  That worked but I did not know how to log on.  I checked the product manual that is on the CD ROM.  I found the information buried in there.  That got me to a place where I could enter the appropriate IP address, subnet, gateway and DNS.  Then the unit worked.  What a pain. <br /> <br />I cannot comment on the broadcast range since we always have this router and our laptops in the same room.  It works fine at short distance.  Connection by ethernet cable is as it should be.  However, Linksys should be ashamed of bringing such a poorly designed product to market.  One of the reasons I bought it was Linksys' good reputation and the trouble-free use of other Linksys products in my home and office.  Their reputation has now plummeted.

Pretty cool. Still learning to work on some things, like trying to go back a few pages, though you are to tap the left side at the bottom, doesnt always work, but you can tap on the very top and it will give you the option of going to the last page read. I will still occasionally have books I want to purchase; especially the hardbacks; I collect certain types of reading, but this even gives you options for other books that we might be interested in. If you aren't a Prime member; you really should be, since many books are free or greatly reduced in cost if you are a Prime member. (and I love that if I decide I want to purchase a certain book; most can be purchased and will be wired to you within minutes! The Con: does the company who makes these products need proof readers? I ran a magazine, was the head writer and a journalism major with many articles published, and also was editor of a fairly large newsletter for many years and can pick up on miss-spelled word like a magnet and am finding many in these kindle books. For those of us who are avid readers, glitches like that kind of stop us instantly; not supposed to have reading material with words spelled wrong, or even &#34;hey; use the lower case, thats not supposed to be a hash line, its supposed to be a period!&#34; So if that kind of thing bothers you, you may want to just build another book shelf. It *is* nice to be able to grab up my Kindle and quietly read; no pages to turn, it has its own &#34;nightlight&#34;, you pick out what size font you'd prefer, can highlight sentences, words, whatever. I am a cancer fighter and sometimes need to just lay down, relax and bury myself into a good book, so this does the trick. Plus, if I am rushed to the hospital; I don't have to settle for whatever book my husband grabs; I just grab the Kindle and the power cord. Just do let me know if you need proofreaders; as long as I can control what types of books I'd need to immerse myself into; I can easily help with the misspellings and wrong keystokes easily; bet there's a few more who'd love to help; most of my friends are avid readers as well.",

Although I told them that I have already tried swapping slots and downloading latest drivers, the sluggish customer service asked me in their reply to \\\\\"try downloading latest drivers and swapping PCI slots\\\\\". These guys never bother to read what you wrote in your email.  Anyway, after corresponding with them for over one month (they typically take more than a week to reply each email, using a one-line response), finally one agent told me I had a defective sound card, and authorized an exchange. <br />Upon receiving the replacement card, everything worked fine. Installation was as easy as the very first time I'd installed it. But yesterday (March 09, 2003), my card died again.  Exactly the same problem. The setup program cannot detect the card.

The drive runs quiet, it seems faster in loading games, and I have higher capacity. I'm using The old 80gig harddrive from the PS3 as backup for my PC using just a silicone cover and SATA-to-USB cable.    There are so many hard drives on Amazon and other tech sites. It seemed so difficult to choose, plus I was not sure if all 2.5\\\\\" laptop drives would work with PS3. I chose this drive based on few key elements and went for most bang for the buck. 1) I like Western Digital drives, i've had no issues in the past 2) 250 gig seems like the sweet spot for price and practical space for PS3 use 3) I wanted 7,200 RPM speed for faster GT5 loads!!",

I upgraded my old Linksys BEFW11S4 to the ea4500. Overall I have been happy with the ea4500 (won't go into the issues I'm having with it) but the coverage range was an issue. I purchased the &#34;refurbished&#34; linksys RE2000 V1 and was able to manually set it up with relative ease. It performed as advertised - I had a strong signal in the area that previously had a weak signal. Everything was great for about a week and a half. The devices connected to the RE2000 would lose the connection and not reconnect until I reset the RE2000 by unplugging it. The device was extremely warm, bordering on HOT, to the touch. I reconnected and in about a week the same thing would occur.  I contacted linksys support. They were very responsive and courteous and eventually decided I had a defective unit - I gathered from my conversation with the tech rep and CS rep that this was a common issue. They sent me out a replacement. This time it was an RE2000 V2. Set up was a breeze and everything seemed to work great - for about a month - then I began to experience the same problems. Devices that were connected to it would drop the connection and it was warm/hot to the touch. At this point I'm going to &#34;eat&#34; the loss and not ask for a replacement as it is clear that these devices have not actually been refurbished but plugged in and tested - but not allowed to &#34;heat up&#34; - then labeled as OK and resold. Needless to say I am not inclined to recommend Linksys/Belkin products to family and/or friends.",

Now, my only option to retrieve my data is an expensive data extraction by Western Digital.      I think they spent too much money on exterior design and not enough on reliability !  I would gladly trade the look of this drive for one that doesn't fail.  A responsible manufacturer would recall a product with a failure rate this high or at least warn their customers that they need to back-up their back-up before it fails.    Not sure what I am buying to replace this but it won't be a Western Digital external drive.

When the Intuos 4 stylus wore to the point it fell apart completely, I had to get a new one.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed! This one is skinny, the stand it comes with is a lot better, and it feels like a pencil. It has no rubber grip so I don't have to worry about it wearing down and exposing the glue-- then getting my hand sticky. UGH! It was just as bad as the Graphire pen when it wore down.<br /><br />This Classic pen is still going strong!

I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support.",

Unfortunately, this is one of my purchases which truly deserves a one-star rating.<br /><br />One of the Amazon product pictures showed this unit as having 4-pin DSL connection.  That feature immediately put this unit high on my list of possible purchases, because I wanted a 4-pin connection to give me the best performance with my high speed service.  When the unit arrived it had only a 2-pin connection.  I don't believe that Amazon was trying to deceive anyone by using this picture, but I made my purchase largely because of this inaccurate picture.<br /><br />The product arrived DOA.  These things happen with computer equipment, but I needed a modem right away when I bought this one.  I chose to go to the local WalMart, where I bought an Actiontec unit which fit my needs but also has a 2-pin connection.<br /><br />Amazon was great, as always, on my return of this unit.  They accepted it back without question and without the original packaging.  They provided the postage to ship it back, and promptly credited my credit card when they received it.<br /><br />I don't like to give one-star ratings, as most products have some value.  However, because of the incorrect and misleading (aka deceptive) picture, I effectively bought something I didn't want which also turned out to not work at all.",

Faster than the charger that came with the phone but no faster than any other charger: apparently the kindle somehow knows to draw more power but the phone firmware doesn't.

And, I was never very pleased by the older model: it make some strange noises that scared in the beginning. All four ST32000542AS units that I have do the same strange \\\\\"click\\\\\" noise. Googling I discovered that this annoying noise is normal for the first LP generation. This is a problem when you have 5 of then working together in a NAS.    So, the first improve I noticed in STL2000DL003 is the quiet operation.  Then I made some benchmarks using  HD Tach:  - Compared with ST32000542AS (firmware updated to CC35) the unit is faster in average read (113MB/s against 97.1MB/s) and uses less CPU (2% against 3%), but has worst Random access (17.4ms against 14.2ms).  - Compared with WD20EARS:  the unit is faster in average read (113MB/s against 100.6MB/s) and same CPU use (2%), but has worst in Random access (17.4ms against 16.2ms).    Anyway, it's a nice HDD for the price.     Other Thoughts:  Some people do prefer WD hard drives, but in my experience there is no advantage in this particular brand. In the past I need to use worldwide RMA (from Brazil, to be specific) from WD and from Seagate. More than one time for both companies. Seagate was always fast and painless: no more than one week between send the defective unit and receive a new one (again: outside USA!).But with WD was a nightmare every time! More than one month to receive back the same unit, but refurbished. Guess what? The defective unit that they refurbished  and sent me back has become defective again... Another \\\\\"over a month\\\\\" waiting for a solution. This happened more than one time, first with external HDD then with internal HDD (green caviar)! Since these events, I never bought a WD again and I don't recommend to anyone.  So, in my opinion and my experience, the Seagate costumer service is another highlight for this HDD.",

Nobody will respond on the chat, and both time I calmly spoke to a representative on the phone letting them know the issues with the device and waiting for them to help me, they hung up on me while &#34;transferring me.&#34;<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't bother. Or if you do, purchase from the Microsoft Store or Best Buy where you can take it in and speak to real people.",

At first I thought I wouldn't like the wired remote for this system, but after using it, I really like the dial system it uses. THX Certification is definitely the way to go when it comes to speakers. Actually, after getting these speakers, I realize how much of a difference it makes to have good quality music to play on them. Some songs, you can actually hear the distortion on if they are not good quality songs. I'm not sure why I waited so long to buy a pair of speakers, but I'm really happy I got these ones.",

The only downside was that there were no instructions but it was easy to figure everything out with one small exception which caused me some concern.     It was pretty stupid of me but I almost returned mine shortly after it arrived because I thought it wasn't working properly.  I would pull the light out of its recessed position in the back cover and sometimes it would come on and sometimes it wouldn't.  This made me sad because I was so pleased with the cover that I really didn't want to return it.  I was sharing my problem with my spouse and we realized there was a click when i pulled the light out.  We quickly figured out that you have to pull the light out until you hear that click or the light doesn't come on.  I haven't seen anyone else with this problem and I don't know if it was covered in the instructions but thought I would share just in case anyone else had the same problem.  Once I figured it out, i felt pretty stupid for not figuring it out immediately.    All in all this is an awesome product and I highly recommend it for every Kindle owner.  It keeps your Kindle safe and provides a comfortable and, when necessary, well-lit reading experience.",

I gave the box dimension based on the product's description but unfortunately, the company used an extremely big box for the 2 Otium bags that I purchased. The box can even accommodate 10 more bags. So just imagine I paid for the air inside the box. No wonder the Live Chat support cannot answer the exact dimension of the box used.

I have had a few USB hubs burn up in the past, it will eventually happen.... that is why I prefer to use external hubs instead of plugging up every port possible on my PC.<br /><br />As luck would have it, this USB hub just died yesterday - a little over 5 months from the day I received the product.  I went to Anker's website to find their service center phone number, called them up... and guess what?  In just a few short minutes I was guaranteed they were shipping me the new upgraded version (as the model # I purchased was discontinued) and also an RMA to send this defective one back.<br /><br />Hello?  How can anybody complain?  Most electronics are usually only warrantied 30 to 90 days without an extended warranty (which is not offered many times) but here it is over 150 days and they going to replace it with no extra charges.<br /><br />THANK YOU ANKER!

I ordered this monitor, overnight, from Amazon and have been very pleased.  It's, in my opinion, a much better monitor for digital photography.  It displays 100% of the AdobeRGB gamut, which is better than the Apple, and offers much easier calibrating (I use an X-rite i1 that works beautifully with this screen).  I calibrate it weekly and have noticed only minimal shift the first week or two as it adjusted to being used 8 hours a day.    Positives for this monitor: it's big and sturdy, bright, even, crisp, and has awesome color range.  The USB hubs work very well, allowing me to plug in a mouse, keyboard, and printer with no problems.  I've taken it on location, and it's held up well in transit.  It looks professional.    Negatives: It seems to take a few minutes to warm up to accurate color.  When I first start it up in the morning, it looks a little green for a few minutes.  Also, it doesn't have the old Apple's on/off control for the computer tower, nor does it respond to the brightness keys on the Apple keyboard.  It does, however, sleep when the computer says to and wake up again with the computer... not bad.  Also, I strongly recommend Not using this screen for serious graphic work without calibrating it.  The difference the first calibration made was very striking....    I strongly considered much more pricy monitors from LaCie, Eizo, etc...  But decided to give this one a shot.  I was prepared to return it if it didn't live up to my very high expectations.  I will be keeping it and am very pleased.    Highly recommended!",

Those complaining about the plastic drive sleds and or the case - don't get it. Given the price/performance of the Synology and the applications  that ship with the unit are top notch.  The combination of fast CPU,RAM and Synology's DSM software clearly turn the Synolgy into a full fledged enterprise like NAS solution.<br /><br />I should note I am upgrading from a couple of Drobos. I didn't realize how bad Drobo's performed until I booted the Synology. Drobo's are extremely slooow and the SW/firmware wt DROBO is just garbage compared to Synology. After two days I've migrated 4TB of data which is extremely fast. A Drobo would take almost a week to transfer a similar amount of data. Additionally the Synology is almost silent compared to slow and noisey Drobo product.<br /><br />I would highly recommend spending the extra money and look to the Plus series due to the increased performance gains from the additional RAM and CPU. The small uplift in exchange for a life of superior performance is worth it.<br /><br />I installed and configed the 412Plus using the stock firmware. I wanted to see how the unit performed out of the box without an update. I experienced ZERO problems.  After I gen'ed the disks, I upgraded the firmware.<br />More updates after I complete my 10TB migration.<br /><br />6/20 update<br /><br />After migrating 8TB of data, I decided to move the unit to it's permanent location, powered down the unit and discovered what many have called the Blue Light of Death - a blinking light.  I wasn't sure if this was an error or the unit was simply booting the disks.  After a min or so of BLOD - I depressed the power button again, this time depressing the power switch for a few seconds - the units beeped - and quickly re-booted.  I am wondering if this is the flashing blue led people are complaining about.  In closing, I am so impressed with the Synology DS412+  I purchased another unit from Amazon. Synology is great  Drobo is garbage.urchased another unit from Amazon. Synology is great  Drobo is garbage.",

So here it is 7 months later and somehow my kids, ages 6,5,5,3, changed the password in the Freetime I pay every month for, which is the reason I got it so they can't buy and change things without passwords that only I know, and have their own personal accounts. Therefore I cannot log out of Freetime to change their accounts. And somehow I also lost my access to wifi, which I cannot try to reconnect as I cannot get out of Freetime to get into settings! I just had to deregister my Kindle and will now have to reset it, losing all my info! The other Kindle I have the screen freezes constantly and goes on and off a lot. We have not used it in months. Also the charge time through a computer usb port is HORRIBLE! I estimate it takes at least 4 hours, to maybe as much as 6 hours to charge it. Sure you can buy their 19.99 fast charger, but after paying $200 a piece I would expect that a wall plug would come with it. I got myself a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for Christmas, along with the 2 HD's. It was $20.00 cheaper than the HD, came with a charger that plugs into a wall outlet, and it performs much better! Not once have I had to contact Samsung about my tablet, but this is now the third time I have had to call about the HD in 7 months. If I could return these and get them a Samsung instead I would! These really perform poorly! I researched for a month on which tablet to buy, and went with the HD because it seemed the most kid friendly, the best educational tool, and the best deal over a mini ipad.

And unlike many companies, Medialink wants to hear from you if you need help.  I didn't need help but it's the thought that counts.      The Wireless N is very easy to set up, you don't have to log into a confusing multi-screen set up page and feel exasperated because you're out of your league.  Set up goes like this.  Power up the Medialink and wait for it to cycle.  When 2 of the blue lights are blinking on and off it is ready.  Put the installation CD in the computer and it takes it from there.  In a couple of minutes it is connected. Just follow the steps on the set-up instruction sheet and you can't fail.      As for how well it works I have to say it works great. It makes a terrific difference. I'd tried a Buffalo router some years back but with or without it my dsl connection got very slow and dropped too often to be acceptable.  I gave up on the router and just had the dsl modem plugged directly into the computer.  I still had connection drops throughout the day, every day, and was not a satisfied customer at all.      When I set up the Medialink, I wanted it and my ugly dsl modem and phone lines and wires, plugs and cords out of my sight and off my desk.  I put it all in another room and the wireless signal strength is full on solid. It is fast. I have no connection drops at all.  This wireless router has allowed me to get connected, enjoy a fast connection, and stay that way. Plus it let me get all that connectivity technology off my desk.  Three cheers for Medialink.  It is quality all around.    All those arrogant, profit hungry, rip-u-off famous name corporations don't deserve our business.  Companies like Medialink deserve our business. It's a win-win situation like it's supposed to be. Thank you Medialink for doing it right.",

Its plug has a blue light on the end so you can see if it is on and nothing.  Curious, I cracked it open to see what the failure mode was.  Its case is not meant to be opened and had to be forcefully pried apart.  Once apart I found it totally encased in potting cement to keep its components unmovable.  This unfortunately made it impossible to troubleshoot because you could not get to the components to test or repair.  From the reviews, it looks like about 2/3 of these charges work OK and 1/3 go out in short order.  This charger label says it is an Original Dell that I ordered  from TexasDiscountElectronics but not sure if a knock off or not.  This seems to be a problem with many of the replacement chargers but there is little recourse but get another one to try.

I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.<br /><br />It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a \\\\\"fix file system\\\\\" on my computer.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 2012<br />After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to \\\\\"recover\\\\\" or \\\\\"wipe\\\\\" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.<br /><br />Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.<br /><br />**UPDATE 2**<br /><br />After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can \\\\\"assess\\\\\" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the \\\\\"destroyed\\\\\" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.<br /><br />I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate.disk.

I was even able to get mine tuned-up by remote technical support (which isn't possible on most tablets) because it has Windows 7 Professional as its OS.<br />I love the fact that is has a 64GB hard drive giving me plenty of space for my Bible Explorer, Christian Library, Microsoft Office, Photos & basically everything I keep on my lap top (which is much of what I keep on my desk top).<br />I have two wireless printers connected to this little dynamo, which were installed quickly & easily.<br />The HP Slate 500 has 2GB of Ram &  with the Inntel Atom processor I find it at ease running multiple programs on it.<br />It's also great to browse the internet, check & send emails, create documents & I especially like reading my Kindle books on it.<br />The Slate 500 is a surprisingly fast little tablet - no, it's not like a laptop with 8GB of RAM and an Intel i7 processor, but it's pretty impressive for a tablet. The 8.9\\\\\" screen is bright, clear and reabable in any lighting condition I have encountered. The battery life  (at about 5 hours per charge) is not the greatest, as my net book gives me over 10 hours a charge & my lap top provides me with 8, however it has not been a problem for me, as I've yet to need to be unplugged for that amount of time.<br />The (included) digital pen cursor (runs on one AAAA battery) is a must and the dock is a great aid, with additional USB ports which come in handy.<br />I'm someone who has avoided tablets, because I prefer a traditional keyboard, however the HP Slate 500 is the one tablet that I truly enjoy using, and this is being written over 3 years after the Slate's original release date.",

They shipped it late and broken, and then charged ME for the return shipping after trying to get me to open the case and re-attach things (things hadn't been hooked up and a fan was loose in the case, which caused damage during shipping).  When I sent it back and demanded a rebuild, they took their time on that also.  When I finally got it back, it was STILL broken with even MORE loose items in the case, and once again they insisted that in order to honor any warranty, I had to take the side off and try to re-connect things to the MB again.  When I demanded that they give me my money back under their 30-day money-back \\\\\"guarantee,\\\\\" they said it had been over 30 days since my initial order (due to THEIR screwups), so tough luck.  I yelled and screamed and got shafted for another return shipping fee.  At the end of the day I got my money back through my credit card company but in the interim I had to deal with IBuyPower's shoddy workmanship, non-existent customer service, long wait times on the phone, and a horrid attitude from everyone I spoke to there.<br /><br />Go online and have a look and you'll see that my experience with them was the norm, not the exception.",

Because you will get no answer. No matter how many messages you leave, or that you call in the middle of work hours. The recording will talk at you, then promptly give you the figurative finger.<br /><br />After cursing and raving at my broken new computer while trying to type e-mails with a cursor afflicted with tourette syndrome,  I finally got a helpful reply with information to send my computer to the RMA department. This was two months later. I was so happy they they were finally going to fix it that I almost didn't get annoyed about the fact that I had to find my own shipping box to fit this behemoth computer, buy my own package materials, and pay for the shipping. But then I got annoyed. I live in Alaska.<br /><br />The story doesn't end there. I get an e-mail today from the repair department with pictures of the package, and it looks like someone dropped it in a muddy puddle, then a velociraptor promptly stomped on it after chewing on it for a while. Despite the big red sticker stating \\\\\"FRAGILE! HANDLE WITH CARE!!!1\\\\\" plastered right on the front. Now, I know it's not their fault, but they want another 300 dollars out of me to repair the resulting -surprisingly- small dent to the corner of the blasted machine. And for me to send them all my credit card info.<br /><br />So, yeah, you can buy this computer if you want to take a gamble that you will never have to deal with MSI after the purchase. I read that customer service sucked in previous reviews before buying this computer, but I never thought I would have to deal with them. I wish I had a time machine so I could go back and slap myself in the face for wasting 1700+ dollars.",

I've been running this card about a week now and have put it through numerous and frequently repeated stress tests from 2004's Half-Life 2 Source SDK to FutureMark11. As for the driver and crash issues that everyone keeps reporting I have had only one crash. I never even touched the included driver disc, installed the card - turned on the PC then went straight to AMD's website. DL'd the latest CCC Suite and the driver has not ONCE given me any issues.<br /> The card did crash once though not from/during game-play. There is a new feature built into most of the newer AMD GPU's that when the PC goes to sleep or standby the card goes into an ultra-low power consumption mode. A BRILLIANT idea on paper on AMD's part but the chinks haven't been worked out quite yet in the execution. So MOST of the driver crashes and locking up you read about is caused by the computer going to sleep and the card failing to properly reinitialize on start-up. Be confident though that future updates will work this out and all those complaints will not have been in vain. AMD is very good about listening to user feedback and utilizing it.<br /><br />**Turn off sleep/standby mode in your power control settings until such time as the issue is patched and you will be golden.**<br />**DOWNLOAD the newest drivers instead of trying to use the ones shipped in-box, they are almost NEVER up to date or even worth installing.**<br /><br />Build/Quality<br /> I bought THIS version on the card because GigaByte is the same brand-name as my MoBo and I like things to match. (NOTE** This has zero effect on anything so don't think it's going to help or hinder you at all; it is 100% a personal preference on my part!) Also it didn't hurt that the total price (item+shipping+tax) was at the time the lowest I had found anywhere. And for the most part I am satisfied with it. The large fan creates PLENTY of airflow over the heat-synch andis oriented to pull-in cool air across the GPU, pushing hot air away/out of the case. This helps keep circulation up and system temps down, especially under load. It does create more background/white noise, but honestly you can't run anything with this much power and NOT make some noise to cool it. That being said I was disappointed with the thin and VERY cheap plastic surround that the GIGABYTE logo is stamped on. Known for being one of the best, high-end, quality manufacturers of PC components; I was not expecting to see something that looked this cheap and felt so very flimsy. The fact of the matter is this bit of dressing, serves no actual function except to be the placeholder for the logo. So ultimately it's a moot point but still... It just seemed out of place for an otherwise high quality construction.<br /><br />Technical Stuff<br /> I am pleased and very excited about my purchase and since it's the first time I have the room for it I WILL probably buy another one in the future to utilize that CrossFireX so brazenly stamped all over the place. It's a GREAT value and a great card. It has taken every bit of punishment my stress tests can through at it and dominated them all. Frame-rates are consistently in the high 60's on every game/video-test I run. Even @ 1280p with 8x anti-aliasing and 16x Anisotropic filtering! My current test rig is an Intel Core i5-k OC'd @ 3.5GHz, 16Gb DDR3. After upgrading from an Nvidia I was blown away. This card is CRAZY powerful and I was salivating when 5 minutes after I placed my order I found the same GPU in a card with 2GB of on-board memory and a similarly OC'd GPU with a bigger/nicer looking inter-cooler for only about $30 more. To be honest that is the card I would say you SHOULD get, but at the end of the day I can't say a single bad thing about this card, it REALLY woke up the beast in my machine and only has room to improve with future driver updates! You really can not ask for more in a GPU. Sorry this ran so long but there is just so much right about this card I want you to know it's worth your investment!<br /><br />In Closing<br /> This GPU I would say is second place only to itself in the \\\\\"Bang-vs-Dollar\\\\\" for Budget-Gamers market! And to be honest for the near future, this really is more than enough power to run any program out there. The next level cards are more than $100 step up in price and tout lower core-clock speeds; go with the 2GB version and you've even got more memory than most next level cards. The pros and the well versed users will be the only ones that actually gain any advantage by using the more expensive GPU's. Because unless you really know your stuff, and are able to/willing to custom tweak your settings for every task you perform, you wont even begin to tap all the extra stuff on those MUCH more expensive cards. I run everything on true-maxed settings, with v-sync anti-aliasing and anisotropic filters turned up and my lowest results yet was Starcraft II during an extremely busy battle scene - the frames dipped into the low 30's for a couple of seconds there. And THAT is something I say with pride, this card has everything you want and need and then some. I HIGHLY recommend this card and brand name, if you don't choose the 2GB edition.<br /><br />Games Run: (so far)<br />Starcraft II - maxed<br />Half Life 2 - maxed<br />NfS Most Wanted - maxed<br />NfS The Run - maxed<br />Battlefield 3 - maxed<br />Mass Effect 3 - maxed<br />Fallout: New Vegas - Very High (moderate modding)<br />Fallout: 3 - maxed (EVERYTHING on and up, heavily modded)<br />Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - maxed (some light modding - textures/sky)<br />Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - maxed (heavily modded)<br />Fable: The Lost Chapters - maxed<br />Far Cry 2 - maxed<br />Crysis - maxed<br />Crysis 2 - very high<br />The Battle for Middle Earth I & II - maxed<br />Saints Row: The Third - maxed<br />Metro 2033 - very high<br /><br />VGA Stress Tests:<br />Half Life source SDK<br />Crysis<br />Far Cry<br />3DMark03 Pro<br />3DMark05 Pro<br />3DMark06 Pro<br />3DMark11 Advanced Ed.",

Here is why I changed my mind and went from a 1-star to 5-star rating.  I cannot seem to make that change above where the stars are located.  So, assume it says \\\\\"5 stars\\\\\".    First of all, I DID have it wrong. There was a plastic strip inside the cover and it does hold the book in place.  The problem was in the instructions on just how to get it to work  I still do not like the design of this method, but it does function.  And yes, it was finally someone really helpful in customer service who explained in detail how to make the plastic thingie work.  (I believe this is an art and a skill).    This makes reading a pleasure as the pages mostly stay in place and do not slip.  Further, I have developed a habit of frequently book-marking the pages so that if I get lost, I can find the page I was reading without too much difficulty.  I devised this strategy while reading a 500+ page book and inadvertently losing my place.  It took hours to find it again.    I still think Kindle could improve the lighting, and also the method for tracking one's progress and pages.  I look forward to a later version.  I have to say I LOVE the Kindle now that it works properly.  Have read over 30 books on it so far, and my favorite thing is that when I travel, I can carry a library with me, and not the weight of loads of books.  It is convenient and has brought me much joy.    I am leaving my original comments below, and do read the comments others posted to it.  I am forever baffled why people react so hostilely to negative reviews.  I post reviews when products cause me to react.  I appreciate those who let others know that there are problems with something so that they do not make a purchasing mistake.  However, it seems that others react  strongly to a negative review, maligning the writer, superimposing their judgments on why the person has written a negative review (the reviewer must be a social misfit, hates society etc.) Give me a break!  Reviewers post negative reviews often to warn others, not to express, at least in my cheery optimistic case, a vendetta against the world.    OLD REVIEW POSTED ABOUT 6-7 MONTHS EARLIER      I waited 6 weeks to get this device and am deeply disappointed for several reasons.  It is so poorly designed that the slightest movement sends the pages scrolling forwards or back, and it is easy to lose one's place. The back screen on which the print appears is uncomfortable--you cannot change it to make it lighter or darker, so you are stuck with a dark background and the print is not easy to read,especially in artificial light. There are only 6 font sizes, you cannot change how dark or light the print itself appears.  It hurts my eyes.    The Kindle is supposed to sit and be used in a carrying case.  It constantly falls out.  Nothing grips it.  Also, it feels heavier than most paperback books. It is not that light to hold.    Customer service is awful.  They seem, by and large, untrained, surly, and unsure and have no idea what causes problems.  For example.  I ordered 2 books and it took 10 hours, 10 HOURS, not seconds,as they promise, before they showed up on my Kindle. When I called to ask why, customer service said they had no idea and had no help or apology. They then hung up on me.  Not at all like Amazon's great customer service in other areas.    The Kindle concept is superb, but the execution is poor.  Maybe the next generation will eliminate the flaws, but I am going to return this piece of junk.",

Unlike every other router or similar device I have ever used, this one didn't provide direct access to the configuration parameters.  Until *after* successful configuration, the only parameter screen available is the so-called \\\\\"wizard,\\\\\" which was unable to configure the Extender properly for our system.<br /><br />Like many wireless router users, we have two kinds of security: WPA2 personal and a permitted MAC-number list.  We manually added the Extender's MAC number to the router's permitted list.  Then the wizard successfully downloaded the parameters for the first security but (apparently) not the MAC-number list.  So the Extender could then access the router, but the the same computer that I had used to set it up could no longer see the Extender.<br /><br />I've worked with computers for fifty years.  Our neighbor is a certified network engineer, whose wireless AP we are using, with his permission, from across the street.  Both of us tried to configure the extender, collectively spending a couple of hours on the task, to no avail.  We couldn't get past the brain-dead \\\\\"wizard.\\\\\"<br /><br />When I asked for help by e-mail, the rep advised me to disable MAC-number screening on the router, set up the Extender with the wizard, and then re-enable the MAC-number screening on the router.  The only problem was that our neighbor's router (unlike most) does not have a software button to temporarily disable MAC-number screening.  So we would have had to delete all his twenty MAC numbers and re-enter them by hand, just to follow the rep's advice.  Then we would have have to manually enter the MAC numbers for the three devices in our house, also by hand, into the Extender's list.<br /><br />The Extender, of course, doesn't need to serve all the twenty MAC numbers for devices in my neighbor's house.  It only needs to serve the three or so in mine, which would not have been hard to enter by hand.  Since my neighbor and I already had spent hours trying to configure a $70 product, and since I had little confidence the programmers had done their jobs right, I sent the box back.<br /><br />My advice to prospective buyers is simple.  If you are sure your router has the latest easy-config software (called WPS, I think), try this box.  If you like to configure things by hand, look for another product that can do this.  If the programmers had given users direct access to the Extender's parameter list, we would have been up and running in ten minutes.",

Does anyone else face the same problem? I'm surprised this hasn't bothered other people enough to mention extensively in the reviews. I will let it air out for a couple more days to see how it fares. I may have to consider glass mousepads like the Steelseries I-2.",

No one told me I would be getting a refurb, and I don't know what they do to refurbish it other than wipe it off but the firmware was two versions old. I don't even know if it was the newer model with more memory.    I called Kindle support and after being transferred twice was told I couldn't have a new one because the return period was over, except the return period for items bought in November & December 2014 is end of January 2015. So I said I'll just return it all the one being replaced, the refurb replacement and the case. They said they would process it and send a confirmation email with a return shipping label. I had to call back ask for it since it did not arrive promptly, and when it did, they did not include the refund for the case.  My wife and I have been good customers for Kindle. Between us we have four Kindles, not including the Paperwhites. At this point I am completely dissatisfied with Amazon's handling of this and frankly, pretty disgusted with the whole process.  And before people start whining this isn't a review of the product, it is. Having to replace two of them in a five week period says a lot about the product. I'm going back to my Kindle 5.

Well, waiting the 7 days didn't help--the odor (apparently emanating from the paint they use on the case, according to the manufacturer) is just too much for me.  It's a shame, really...the case is nicely designed.  Simply put, if it didn't have such a terrible chemical smell, I believe I would have enjoyed using the case.<br /><br />Update #2: Starting to have my doubts if the terrible smell of this case will ever go away. I have had it airing out for five days now, and the awful smell persists.  The company has contacted me and offered a replacement.  Well, I'm not convinced that's going to help.  The reason? Check the reviews of their other cases on amazon, and you'll see: customers are complaining about a smell associated with their other cases as well. This is completely ridiculous...buy a product, and \\\\\"air it out for several days\\\\\" before you can even start to use it?!?!? The features of this case make it appear to be a very attractive purchase.  But the odor emanating from the case makes it unusable.  I suspect I am going to have to end up returning it. I'm going to wait a couple more days and see what happens.  But after five days of airing it out already, I really don't expect much is going to change.<br /><br />Update #1:<br />Third day of ownership...the rooCASE is still in my garage, \\\\\"airing out.\\\\\"  Feeling pretty frustrated.  I realize it's only the third day of \\\\\"airing out,\\\\\" and the manufacturer asked me to air it out for seven days...but, sheesh!  Shouldn't I have to \\\\\"air it out\\\\\" for ZERO days?!?!?  Deducting another star...we're down to 2 stars now.  More to follow...<br /><br />Original review:<br />Received the case after a short delay.  Opened the box and was immediately confronted by a terrible odor, a very strong chemical smell.  I contacted rooCASE's support personnel and they explained thatthe smell was from an oil-based paint used on the edges of the case.  They suggested the smell should dissipate after about seven days.  They further indicated this odor problem resulted from their rush to get the cases out to customers, and that normally they let the cases air out prior to shipping; but they have not employed this practice of late due to customer demand.<br /><br />Right now, after two days of ownership, I still consider the case to be unusable due to the extremely strong odor.  I am letting it air out as advised by customer support.  Now really, c'mon...should it really be necessary to let a product like a Kindle case \\\\\"air out\\\\\" for seven days prior to use?  To my way of thinking, this is completely unacceptable.  The manufacturer is clearly aware of the problem, but has decided to ship them out in this condition anyway.<br /><br />The case looks like a fine case, and I will likely use it...if the smell does indeed dissipate.  I certainly hope I do not have to wait seven days, as the manufacturer indicated to me.  If the odor does not dissipate, I will have to return the case--it's really that strong.<br /><br />FIve stars for potential; zero stars for shipping a case that has to be \\\\\"aired out\\\\\" for seven days prior to use.  Thus three stars at this early point in time.  I will update the review as things progress.  So far, overall...disappointment.",

It seemed rather thin for my liking...and didn't seem like it would do anything for protection.  Finally, my Kindle arrived and I got to put the case to use.  The Kindle Fire fits TIGHTLY in the case so there is no sliding around.  The small outside pocket was just big enough to put a few dollars or cards when I took the Kindle and case to the local coffee shop.

When you think about it though, this makes perfect sense because they've had so many returns on these things that I'm sure they have a warehouse full of reconditioned units.  One thing to think about though is this ... do you really want to send back a drive that has lots of your info on it and run the risk that some techno-weenie at the factory in a third world country might get their hands on it?

I mean a ton, and I use MS OneNote exclusively for school, and have literally 0, zero, paper notes for my classes...to give you an idea.<br /><br />The first screen protector I bought was MXH Photodon's (HD) screen protector. This cost $19 for 1 sheet. It was good.<br />I now have the Greatsheild (matte) protector, which costs $13 for 3 sheets. Also good.<br /><br />So what's the differences?<br /><br />(1) APPLICATION/INSTALLITION:<br />Both excellent, really easy, fit basically perfect, and easily reversible without leaving any residue what so ever incase some spec of dust got stuck under the film. Only minor caveat is both products have a \\\\\"sticky\\\\\" underside, so you have to be careful dirt doesn't get stuck to it while installing. Just annoying to clean, nothing permanent, and by \\\\\"sticky\\\\\" I don't mean like a glue its more of a texture.<br /><br />(2) REFLECTIVENESS:<br />Highly important to me because its very annoying trying to study under the white fluorescence lights in the library...especially since I use the slate much like a notebook lying relatively flat on the table as oppose to an upright monitor. The MXH sheet was without a doubt noticeably more reflective (obviously not as much as the naked native glass (which is insane). I would say the MXH Photodon cut down the reflectiveness ~40-60%). The GreatSheild is far better in this respect. The \\\\\"matte\\\\\" description is spot on. Reflections are way more blurred out and less intense (I would say itcuts it down around 75-85%). Can't eliminate it completely, but with the GreatSheild I am able to read through the reflection, which is impossible with the native glass, and difficult with the MXH Photodon.<br /><br />(3) CLEARITY:<br />in my opinion the MXH Photodon film was slightly (emphasis on slightly) more clear. Both films seemed to change the way the image from the native screen looks at first, but after a few hours or days its not noticeable nor an issue. Over all the clarity \\\\\"difference\\\\\" is only noticeable when looking at tiny font (i.e. Calibri font, size 8 or less) from a distance of more than 4 or 5 feet away from the slate...so not really a big deal for my purposes, and I can't really think of a situation it would be an issue unless you have really long arms (perhaps with the newer tablets running 1920x1080 resolution vs. my older model Slate that runs 1366X768). Nevertheless, the MXH Photodon does have a small edge on clarity...which is probably why they advertise as an \\\\\"HD, Anti-glare\\\\\" screen protector.<br /><br />(4) FEEL TO TOUCH: the MXH Photodon felt a little harder with a more hard-plastic-ish feel, while the GreatSheild feels much softer like a piece of paper; in fact it feels exactly like my desktop PC's matte LCD monitor. For example, when I move my finger across the screen I hear a noise very similar to the sound I make moving my finger across a sheet of paper. In a way it gives a paper-like feel when inking on the slate.<br /><br />(5) FEEL TO INK WITH THE PEN: There is a difference here. Its not a giant difference, but consistently noticeable and will depend on individual preference. The MXH Photodon is more slick, while the GreatSheild holds more resistance while in writing. I personally like this, makes it more like writing on paper. A good way to put it in perspective is: the native gorilla glass of the Slate is the most slick for inking with the pen. This would lead in a more messy script on my part, and thus a higher error rate & processing time with the text recognition in Windows 8. The GreatSheild would be like the opposite end of the spectrum; not to say its perfect, inking is still more slick that an actually pen/pencil and paper. The MXH Photodon in somewhere in the middle (I would say a little bit closer to the GreatSheild end than the native glass end).<br /><br />(6) SCRATCH RESISTANCE:<br />So, the reason I went with a different choice this time around (other than cost as a student) was because the MXH Photodon accumulated scratches from inking with the pen. The scratches would not happen every time I would ink, just on occasion as I would be writing or drawing I'd hit a \\\\\"rough\\\\\" stroke, such that a minor scratch would be left on the film. A single scratch was not noticeable to the eye (unless you looked really really close at the screen) but I could definitely feel it in my hand when it would happen.<br /><br />It's hard to say why this would happen. It's never happened on the native gorilla glass. It may be because the tip of the wiacom pen that comes with the Slate is not a perfect dome if you look close. It's more like tapered cylinder that does a sharp cone towards the tip, then the absolute tip is smoothed out.<br />looks kind of like this:<br /><br />_tip of the dome<br />/.\\<br />| |^the sharp edge<br />| |<br /><br />Anyway, while 1 scratch was not noticeable, after a full 9 months of using the MXH Photodon (i.e. the entire 1st year of medical school = ~5000 pages of notes) the middle portion of the screen where I (apparently) do most of my writing had accumulated so many scratches that the content behind it became noticeably blurry to the point that I had to zoom in to continue reading. At first I though I was starting to need glasses, then one day I realized the text at the top and bottom of the screen was clear and I didn't need glasses. I first noticed this about a 1-1.5 months ago, and removed the screen protector for my last exam cause it was too annoying. Nobody expectsthese protectors to last forever, and the MXH Photodon lasting 7-8 months with the intense use I put into it was still great value.<br /><br />Now, I can't give an honest comment about the scratch resistance for the GreatSheild since I've only been using it for ~2 weeks. If I can edit this review after my next set of exams in a month I will. My suspicion is that the issue will persist given the GreatSheild feels softer and is likely made of a less resistant plastic...Then again...I haven't had a single scratch yet...and maybe the texture of the GreatSheild is such that it won't scratch with the wiacom pen...only time and studying will tell :)<br /><br />Hope this helps, lol, best wishes.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Now that I've used the Greatsheild for sometime... just wanted to add that:  YES The Greatsheild will also accumulate scratches; there are a couple on the screen protector now. However I still maintain the \\\\\"inking\\\\\" is better, with more resistance meaning less messy script and lower error rate. However, the reduction in image quality is still apparently as well, particularly when viewing the screen corners from an angle (Not that big a deal).",

The case lid also coverts into a stand that allows for two viewing angles, one for use if the iPad is in your lap, and the other for use when watching videos etc, because it is a more vertical angle which I find to be perfect when watching Netflix.  If you are super concerned about the perfect crispness of the new display, some people find that the built in screen protector distracts them.  However, I have found that I have become accustomed to the look of the screen behind the protector and it is something that I feel is a compromise in order to protect the screen.  The fit and finish is great and I have found that the box works perfectly for me and the added weight and bulk actually help me to keep ahold of my device.  When I operated the iPad before putting the OtterBox on it, I always felt that the iPad was about to slip out of my hand.  However, the Otter is not for everyone and you know what you want in a case.  If you want a sleek and slim feel with by little bulk, then the Otter is not for you.  You would probably be better with a portfolio or other style case.  It's kind of like buying a four wheel drive vehicle.  If your main use is going to be driving around town getting the kids and groceries then a crossover is probably best for you.  However, if you are going to be going off into the mountains and wilderness then a more hardcore SUV is best.  Same with the OtterBox.  If you don't think that you need the ultimate protection, then you will be much more happy with a thinner and lighter case.  However, for those of you that want the ultimate protection regardless if you are prone to dropping things or you plan to travel a lot, the Otter is a great choice for you.  For all of the tough guys out there, this is definitely your case!",

You see, this file requires administrative privileges to work properly, or at least that's what it seems because it just won't run by double-clicking it. To behonest, I am not very sure because the [Amazon Censorship]:mentally-challenged software engineers working in the software department of StarTech digitally signed the executable and then altered it, rendering the digital signature invalid. I actually suspect that Windows is refusing to run it because of this fact, and I was only able to circumvent it by right-clicking EasyLink.exe and selecting \\\\\"Run as administrator\\\\\". At this point I am warned that the certificate is invalid, but I am allowed to enter credentials. So I have this OTHER user account from my home domain that does have admin rights. I typed that account in and the (in)famous EasyLink.exe finally runs. It is only at this point that I can proceed with the other part of the installation, which is done in the secondary PC.<br /><br />The story in the Secondary PC is the same: Plug in the other end of the cable, wait for the USB drivers to install, then run EasyLink.exe. Again, I must elevate the process because it either requires admin rights, or is the only way Windows 7 will run it because of the damaged digital signature.<br /><br />At this point I know this will be trouble after a restart, so after watching in awe for 1 minute how easy and SUPER NICE it was to use this thing (after the digital signature odyssey), I proceed to restart both PC's.<br /><br />WAIT! New problem: My main PC refuses to reboot. It turns out that this device confuses the ASUS P5E motherboard's BIOS to the point where the BIOS just won't POST and the PC won't boot. Nice. One more thing to do: If I restart the PC, I must disconnect this USB thing, wait for BIOS to POST, then connect. Granted: Asus hardware is a [Amazon Censorship]:worthless piece of equipment with non-existent customer support, but still it is quite unbelievable to me that it generates such interference.<br /><br />Anyway, after discovering the problem, I was able to reboot the main PC. When it logs back in, the EasyLink.exe software is nowhere to be found. Again,Windows has refused to launch it because of the broken digital signature, or at least I think this is the problem.<br /><br />The rest of my odyssey revolves around trying to make EasyLink.exe to run automatically somehow. Summary of attempts:<br /><br />- A Windows task run as SYSTEM or LOCAL SERVICE on session logon. No go.<br />- A Windows task using SysInternals' psexec tool. No go.<br />- Second best: Autorun of EasyLink.exe in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with creation and addition of an application manifest for automatic elevation of rights. Completely futile.<br /><br />Ok, so I just abandon all hope to make this work. At this point I know I'll just have to start EasyLink.exe manually every time I log in my PC.<br /><br />And you, avid reader, probably think all is over now, right? Well, no. This product assures it can transfer files from one PC to the other by either using the clipboard or dragging. It did not work for me at all. I am thinking it may be because of security issues between the user running the EasyLink.exe program and the file in question. But that's just my guess. In short: It doesn't work.<br /><br />But wait! Let me throw in the cherry on top: The software only takes into consideration the main monitor screen of the PC's. My secondary PC uses a second monitor.  Well, with this thing the secondary monitor is useless.  StarTech's software is so simple-minded that it doesn't conceive the fact that a PC may be using more than one monitor.  Therefore when you use this thing when you have two monitors in the secondary PC, you can kiss your second monitor goodbye because the StarTech software will refuse to let the mouse leave the main monitor area.  Nice, I know. And what infuriates me the most is that I discovered all this in one afternoon. It's like StarTech never QA'd this product at all.<br /><br />So in summary: StarTech has GREAT hardware engineers and complete [Amazon Censorship]:mentally-challenged software engineers programming their software. I tried to give this a two-star rating because seeing this thing working is just awesome, but I just can't.  Not after testing multi-monitor support.<br /><br />The switch between PC's just by moving the mouse to the configured screen edge is SUPERB, which I think is the merit of the HARDWARE engineer(s) at StarTech, but let me be clear: THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT WORKED. The core functionality. The extra goodies were left out in my case.<br /><br />Would I recommend? Tough one. The actual product with better software may be amazing. I don't know how good this company is when it comes to software updates, and I think that would be the key to answering such question. So I'll just say this: If StarTech can patch their horrible, horrible software, yes, this is an amazing product I would completely recommend. I'll contact them and update.",

I figured it would be DAYS...as I am very jaded when it comes to customer service these days.  It was less than 30 minutes and Steve called.  First of all, I was so grateful that he SPOKE ENGLISH!!  (I am not a racist on any level but I get so frustrated trying to muddle through with many tech support people who do NOT and who call me \\\\\"mam\\\\\" every 15 seconds...can they not train these people over there??)  Anyway...I digress.  Steve was the epitome of FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  He was knowledgeable and personable and used the word \\\\\"perfect\\\\\" a lot.  I liked that...it gave me confidence!! I felt like I was plugged into a real human being who was listening intently to me and actually gave a crap as to whether or not my product was up and running.  After a few trial and error issues (nothing bad to do with the product...mostly my personal computer issues)...I was up and running.  I had to do the setup with the extender in a place I didn't really want it because there wasn't enough signal to do the set up where I really DID want it.  So...having done the set up and seeing that the product worked perfectly, Steve told me to unplug it and take it back to where I wanted it.  If it worked, congrats.  If not, I'd have to find another location.  Well...GREAT NEWS STEVE...I am currently typing from the farthest point in our dead area and I have FIVE BARS OF SERVICE!!!  When I am laying in bed, unable to sleep and feeling happy because I actually have enough signal to watch Breaking Bad on my Kindle...I will sing the praises of this product -  The Amped Wireless High Power 600mW Compact wi-fi Range Extender - and of a delightful young man in California named Steve.

Their job is to spray and nothing else. I followed the instructions and did a few extra steps like: 1) Spray your Ipad screen lightly and spray your Zagg screen protector till it is almost dripping. Be very careful you don't let the screen protector flop onto itself.  It is an extreme pain to seperate it from itself. It took me 3 tries of positioning the cover and I had to spray it every time I started over.  After 24-36 hours, my screen dried and I didn't notice any air bubbles left.  Good Luck!

It was one of the best purchases I ever made. I have used it daily and constantly. I have learned all about apps and have quite a few on my kindle now. The ones I use most are The Weather Channel, Text+ (to text my boyfriend on his cell phone as I do not have a texting phone), Netflix, Pandora (to play music in the kitchen while I am cooking), Alarm Clock Xtreme (to time my cooking and loud enough to wake me up in the morning), Cozi Family (I make my bf a grocery list and he can access it from his smartphone or I can send an e-mail of it to him), Yahoo, Droid TV, iTranslate (which can translate into tons of languages english-> Italian French-> English etc) and many more. Those are the ones I use most.  I love the use of Netflix because we use it with the tv, my Kindle and HIS smartphone. I can watch a movie when we go to bed without disturbing him. I also love to read so I have received a ton of free books and others are just as cheap or cheaper than buying the paper or hardback version. I also like to be able to access the internet, especially when I am reading and want to access something related the what I am reading. You don't have to be a genius to use this. The price is well worth it. I had considered an iPad, but this price was more reasonable for me. I also like the size of the Kindle Fire. I can take this most anywhere and stash it in almost any purse I have, big or small. This was one of the reasons I chose it over the iPad. I did have some hesitations when deciding about this, but I am so happy that this is the one I chose. I am loving it so much that today someone has offered to trade my tent for one and I am thinking of getting it so my bf can have one too. I would recommend a good case, the protective cover and a stylus to make the system work at its best.

It took quite a while to sort out but it is worth it.<br />This drive is an OEM laptop drive but can be installed in Desktops with the latest PCIe 3.0 M.2and UEFI support.<br /><br />Cons : Samsung OEM product, not sold as retail so Samsung offers little no support so you have to have pretty advanced skills to get this to run as Windows boot drive. Don't buy this and expect it to be plug and play.<br /><br />Other Thoughts : The SM951 won't show in Asus x99 BIOS as boot drive when first attached. But it will show in BIOS after you have sucessfully installed Windows on it so be patient. You will see it during the windows install when you are prompted to select the drive location for your new Windows install but you might get an error message that Windows can't install on it. I tried many times and failed at this point.<br /><br />The trick for me (not in the guides) was to first attach the SM951 to the MB along with a proven boot drive with Windows 8.1. Then boot the system with the proven Windows 8.1 install. Then use  Windows Disk Management to initialize the SM951 as GPT (or  convert to GPT if MBR exists). Remember the SM951 and the USB boot drive need to be GPT and UEFI. Now install  Windows 8.1 to the SM951 from a bootable USB (GPT + UEFI) Windows 8.1 ISO  made by Rufus or Windows Bootable Image Creator (see guides below). In order for Windows to install at this point the SM951 needs to show as unallocated space. If you get an Error trying to select the SM951 as disk just use ADVANCED to delete the volume on the sm951 and it will show as unallocated space.<br /><br />Good guide here for install with Asus X99: (Format in GPT and do everything in UEFI)<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No-ct8pQcIg<br /><br />Good Guide here to create bootable USB using Windows Bootable Image Creator<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Jzt1r0Qzw<br /><br />Good guide here for generic Bios and bootable USB Windows Installer using Rufus<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUAw0CZFHcUsing Rufus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUAw0CZFHcU",

I also like the small keyboard because there's less hand and finger travel involved so I find it much easier to type.      THE BATTERY is UNREAL.  READ your manuals boys and girls, ESPECIALLY the part about conditioning your battery three times.  Search the internet and download the free program \\\\\"CPUID Hardware Monitor\\\\\".  It shows the \\\\\"wear level\\\\\" and capacity of your battery.  VERY cool.  My battery started with 10% wear level out of the box.  After 3 \\\\\"conditionings\\\\\" as explained in the manual, I have zero wear level and today my power meter says I have 11 hours and 48 minutes to go!  Each \\\\\"conditioning\\\\\" I did, I watched the battery's capacity level in CPUID go up!  I have NEVER seen ANYTHING like this in my life and I have had multiple laptops since 1995.  The battery life is CRAZY.  Obviously those numbers will go down faster as you start and run programs.      I wish they could put decent graphic cards in these netbooks.  NONE of them in this price range on the market have one.  But then that would also kill the battery life as well.  This one will get you by with BASIC graphics handling.  I can watch HD video MP4s only with Quicktime.  VLC Media Player and Windows Media Player (after installing codecs for it) jitter and stutter with HD MP4 videos, Quicktime does NOT.  I have run several BASIC games, Hoyle Casino 2008, MS Pinball Arcade, Virtual Pool 3 and they all seem to run good, no issues.  As you have no T&L or anti-aliasing capabilities with this video card, the heavy duty 3D games stutter and jitter if they run AT ALL.  After a couple days I upgraded the RAM to 2 GB to see if that would help and it did not.  Basic, low graphic games run just fine.  What's funny is I watched HD video on YouTube with zero issues.  I run an older version of Adobe Photoshop without any issues.  Microsoft Office 2007 runs beautifully.    UPDATE: HD VIDEO EDITING  My Sanyo VPC CG10 HD digital camcorder creates videos in HD MP4 format.  I had to do a few things to get this computer to work with them.  I had to install the codecs from shark007.net to get the PC to work with the MP4s. After that, they will play in Windows Media Player as well.  HD editing? I bought the \\\\\"Wondershare\\\\\" Netbook converter suite which includes their \\\\\"DVD to netbook converter\\\\\" and a pretty quick and efficient \\\\\"Video to netbook\\\\\" converter. They have a trial and that's what made me buy it. It's simple, fast, efficient, has many options and takes up very little space on my hard drive. Google them. After trying several other converters, I found this to be the best for me. I convert the videos from MP4 to WMV and load them into the old XP Windows Movie Maker. I found out that XP Windows Movie Maker uses profiles. The default settings don't allow you to save your creations in HD format. HOWEVER, I found dozens of *.prx files, which are the profiles, all over the web. I downloaded several HD profiles. Some included instructions on which folder to copy them to. WALLA! Like magic... I am now editing and saving HD videos with this netbook using Windows XP SP3 and the old XP Windows Movie Maker on a 1.66 Ghz processor, 2 gigs of RAM! No stuttering, no issues, zero problems and the videos come out great!    UPDATE: SEE COMMENTS BELOW ON MY RAM MEMORY EXPERIENCE!    Overall speed.  This thing flies!!!  Clicking on things, opening programs, Windows start up... zooming in a map in Delorme or Microsoft mapping software... ALL wayyyyyyy faster than my 2.2 Ghz Dual Core, 4 GB RAM Windows 7 Professional laptop.  How does THAT happen???  Everything just seems to happen FASTER.  Is it Windows XP?  I don't know but I did WANT a netbook with Windows XP.  I wanted one before you can't buy them any longer.  As it is now, you can't buy them in stores any longer.    Overall, for $300, I LOVE this little machine and have decided I will keep it.  I'll save the HD video editing for my other laptop.  Although, I have not tried it yet on this little machine.  Maybe in a review update.  It's more than half the size as my other laptop and even with a case, can EASILY fit in an airplane carry-on or under a car seat.  I fit MOST of the programs and files I need on the 160 GB hard drive.  Too bad Windows XP does not support any larger sizes.  I anticipate this little machine will be going with me everywhere I go... never leave the house without it!    I give it 5 stars out of 5!!!  It's a keeper!!!    Juan",

            "input": "The PCV-W20 is one awesome integrated desktop.  Sure it's pricey, but you get a lot of features plus Sony's award-winning styling.  The widescreen 15.3\\\\\" (measured diagonally) LCD is beautiful and has excellent contrast ratio.  The CPU is actually 1.8Ghz, not 1.9 (which doesn't exist), but it's still fast.  Sony apparently optimizes the system so it feels as speedy as a 2.4Ghz Dell Dimension 2350 or 4500.<br />Unlike most other one-piece PCs, this one has all the ports loaded: three USB 2.0 ports (but one already taken by the optical mouse), two 4-pin i.Link/IEEE 1394 ports, one line-in port for hooking up an audio input source (e.g., a portable CD player or MP3 player), two PC Card slots, and one Memory Stick slot.  Modem and ethernet are built-in, so you can surf web either way you want.  You also get a DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drive, but no DVD burner.<br />The W-series is really designed for family users who don't need to tinker with the system, so the biggest downside for us geeks is that you can't expand the system easily.  For example, you can't put in a bigger hard disk, although you can get an external USB 2 or IEEE 1394 hard disk, or use an IDE hard disk with an external enclosure kit (e.g., ADS Pyro).  You also can't upgrade the graphics card, which means if you are into the latest 3D games, you are out of luck.  And you can't put in an internal DVD burner; instead you'll need to get an expensive external one (usually at a one-hundrd dolr premium).<br />Specs aside, the W20 is a pleasure to use.  The keyboard does suffer from Sony's annoying policy of doing away with the insert/home/delete/... keys, and the arrow keys are cramped with the main keyboard which makes them hard to use.  But that's about the only gripe.  As mentioned before the system is speedy, and Sony bundles the system with a generous offering of software titles.  The user experience is very positive, so if you can afford it, this is a highly recommend system for your home.",

However, the internal mfg. date detected was 2006, and first used date 2007, with a sticker on the outside of the battery with a written date of 12/11.  So, after a number of Lenovo battery utility deep-cycle charges, the best I can get is 89% of rated capacity.  So, does that meet expectations??  Not from prior experiences with other LiIon battery vendors, where I am advised 3 to 4 years on the shelf is about it.  The product page did not mention anything about it being new, but actually old.  I am waiting to hear from Amazon and this vendor, because this is a bit contrary to the vendor's general ratings. I will update upon a response.  Update: Amazon processed a return and credit, and I bought the same product from a national vendor via Amazon. I am pleased the product I received this time actually had a very recent internal manufacturing date, and exceeds ratings.  So buyers beware with batteries suggesting they are new; ask beforehand if they may have been on the shelf for 5 years!!!",

In fact it seemed to work fine until two days ago when it started to \\\\\"turn off\\\\\" meaning that the indicator light turned off occasionally. The next morning, I plugged it in and I heard a surging buzz sound coming from the power supply, then POP!

You do need to install Samsung Magic and Samsung SSD 840 EVO Performance Restoration and run the restoration program once a month but the return is amazing as you can see by my attached Benchmark test run just a minute ago. I will always buy a ssd drive for any new computers I buy or build whether pc or mac. 5 thumbs up from me!",

However - with this version the security functionality got changed - and not to the better.<br /><br />In the past you had a MAC filter and the obligatory WIFI password. If your device was not in the MAC filter list, you did not get access to the router and the network.<br /><br />Now there is an &#34;Access list&#34; which grants internet access to certain MAC addresses. You might say - what's the difference? Well - once you have specified the password you are in the network. No matter if your MAC address is in the filter list as allowed or blocked. In other words an attacker is able to figure out what the password is and is one step closer (if not even in) your network.<br /><br />Maybe you are intrigued by the fact that you can use this &#34;Access list&#34; for wired connections! But - well... Block a MAC address and you see that you can still see the rest of the (at least) intra net. So what is the security? Blocking a system to access the internet?<br /><br />And then comes the next. Wifi devices are piling up for all kinds of reasons. So you enter them - until you run into the fact that you add devices to the filter and they do not get access anyways - in fact all your clicks on &#34;allow&#34; and / or adding devices to the exception list are forgotten instantly. You will do this game for minutes until you realize that you must have hit a limit in the list length and they didn't even bother to output an error message.<br /><br />If you are looking for a router - the WNDR4300 might be a much better choice (if it still has the old version of the software).",

Such as orienting the tablet in the desired working position, etc..<br /><br />3. Wash your hands, face, and arms before attempting application (avoid falling skin cells, donut crumbs, etc..) Clean the screen and edges thoroughly. Apply the film as fast as possible immediately after cleaning the screen to avoid all particles from becoming sandwiched in between.<br /><br />In the case of the Armor Sheild, I did the above mentioned, pulled the film from the paper backing, sprayed it down and immediately applied it, all in a couple of seconds. It went on beautifully and aligned perfectly. I carefully swept away the air bubbles and wiped away any escaping liquid with the micro fiber cloth. Gave it a good look over and all was well, however, there were many micro bubbles that gave it a very ugly overall look.<br /><br />I removed all of the bigger bubbles, so, I was satisfied with that and followed the directions which stated that micro bubbles are normal and will disappear after a day or three. I am writing this just shy of 24 hours after application and happy to report the screen look 99% perfect. I will wait another day to see if a couple of very insignificant blemishes in the upper corner will fade. It is already looking better there so I think it's going to heal itself just fine.<br /><br />The better news is NO DUST PARTICLES......this is because of working quickly between cleaning and applying.<br /><br />The skin is very nice and overall, the experience was much better than expected. Working with large protectors such as this is always kind of worrisome, but this one couldn't have went better........use patience and the payoff will be fantastic!",

While most of the experiences have been favorable, and some of them not-so-good, I will have to say this is one of the worst experiences I have had with a screen protector.<br /><br />Part of the dissatisfaction comes from the fact the product is poorly packaged: the two screen protectors are in-between a folded and very thin piece of cardboard that gets damaged and bent during shipping.  If the screen protector's packaging gets damaged and / or bent during shipping, the screen protector could possibly get damaged or bent during shipping.  In my case, one of the two protectors in the shipment is worthless.  While that is not a reflection on the screen protector itself, if you're going to shell out almost twenty bucks for two screen protectors you should be able to safely receive two screen protectors.<br /><br />With just one shot to get it right, I lined everything up just right on my new 8.9\\\\\" Fire HDX.  The included instructions are in English, Japanese, and Chinese, but the corresponding positions they refer to for the peeling sequence are in what I assumed to be Japanese on the label.  That's a problem as I don't speak or read Japanese, but I was able to figure what went where.<br /><br />Most screen protector packages come with a cleaning cloth (as you don't want to apply a screen protector over dust or existing smudges), but this one did not; before applying any screen protector you need to clean the screen.  Most screen protector packages also come with a straight-edge so you can smooth out the bubbles but this one did not have one, either.  Despite my best efforts, and about 15 minutes of pushing with a straight edge, there are four bubbles right in the middle of the reading screen that just won't go away.  That makes this screen protector worthless as the bubbles are very distracting.  Seeing as how the second one arrived D.O.A., I'm out of luck.  Granted, all of these issues may be a function of bad product packaging that makes their product defective due to the bends mentioned above.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, while the product description says it has \\\\\"fingerprint resistant coating to enhance experience) there are already fingerprint smudges that took a little extra \\\\\"oomph\\\\\" to remove with a cloth I use for cleaning glasses.<br /><br />With the pain in the neck with the above, there has to be a better product or else everyone will be wasting $20 on this version.

Plus I do not have too much time for all the long phone calls    removed it put back my old wireless B router worked same as earlier and give sable connection with one computer connected      I will say do not waste your money on this router instead buy some other router this thing is not good at all",

Connection to our DSL wireless modem was intimidating, (would not hook up), but the phone company people were able to walk her through getting it to work.  Since then she has used the Kindle wirelessly in Walmart's parking lot, and in McDonalds no problem.  So far there have been no operating problems whatsoever.    Battery life seems pretty good, but staying hooked up to the internet is not necessary and soaks up battery power uselessly, (she has to remember to disconnect).  Selection of books is amazing, and the number of books available for free or 99\u00a2 is great, (saves a ton of money).

I had bought other refurb items before and assumed it was a safe buy. That was my first mistake. As soon as it was delivered, I started having issues. Something was wrong with the monitor and the backlight would not stay on, so I would always have a dim screen. I checked all my settings to make sure I was doing everything correctly. I called tech support, and they walked me through a  few steps to ensure that my settings were correct. They concluded that something was broken and sent a tech to come fix it. Tech didn't fix the issue. I went through this a couple more time before Dell told me to send it back to them and they would fix it. When I got it back, my monitor worked, but I was missing a component I had paid for and that I had before I sent the machine back into Dell. I called Tech Support, and they called me a liar before they agreed to send a tech out to replace the missing component. At one point I had to reinstall Windows (I forget what issue prompted this).<br /><br />Earlier this week, I had a new issue. My laptop would stop charging when connected to the power cable. I borrowed a friend's power cable from another Dell laptop, and the issue persisted. I called Tech Support yet again (I have lost count of the number of times I have had to call them for this machine), and they would only help if I paid $358 to replace the motherboard. They came to this conclusion with only minimal troubleshooting. I complained that I could almost buy a comparable laptop for that money, and the finally agreed to only charge my $179 to fix it. I told them that I could buy a new tablet for that price with almost the same functionality as this machine. They would not budge. I asked if they were essentially telling me that I had bought a defective product, and they agreed to this statement. Because my machine was 2 months out of warranty, they would not help me, despite the numerous issues I have had and that are logged in Dell's records. They told me that &#34;parts can go bad at any time&#34; to justify the huge cost.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a defective machine. Dell refuses to help customers who have bought machines with a history of breaking.<br /><br />However, when the machine worked, it was amazing. I was lucky enough to be able to buy a machine with Windows 7, so I never had any of the issues with Windows 8. I installed the OS to the SSD, and boot time is under 10 seconds. This machine helped me through my senior year of college. It is light, so carrying it in a backpack full of books added minimal weight. The screen is on the smaller side, but I prefer that for laptops. The battery is not easily removable because it is placed in the laptops innards beneath the keyboard. Only the RAM is easily accessible. This machine is not really capable of any kind of serious gaming, but if all you need is a small machine for web browsing and word processing, this is a great machine, when it works. Every time you call customer support/tech support, you have to talk to some one from India. Half the people I talked to I could not understand and had to ask to be transferred to some one else.<br /><br />With the issues I have had with this machine and other Dell machines in the past, I will never buy another Dell.",

            "input": "NOTE: I don't believe anyone should give a review until the item has been used about a year ( Unless the item stops working in less than that time.)<br /><br />I was reluctant to do this but here goes.<br /><br />From the beginning of my computer experience 1989 to 2007 I only used Logetech mice. Specifically the Mouseman. I still have 2 of my 3 original Mousemen, they don't look good but they work very well. I only bought new ones to get extra functionality, not to replace faulty equipment.<br />From 2008 to 2011 I have owned 4 different &#34;At the time top of the Line&#34; Logitech mice. They lasted from 1 month to 1.5 years before becoming totally unusable. The list is as follows:<br /><br />M 525: Less than 6 months. (Demagnetizing didn't work) Button failure. (Double clicking, Won't hold)<br />M 705 Marathon: Less than 1 year. (Demagnetizing didn't work) Button failure, poor tracking..<br />Anywhere MX: 1.5 years after using the internet to find out how to demagnetize it. After 1.5 years button failure.<br />Performance MX: Less than 1 month. (Demagnetizing didn't work) Button failure, poor tracking.<br /><br />All of the above mice initially had poor tracking performance compared to the original Trackman corded mice. I attributed it partially to Microsoft's degrading Windows quality. After this dismal performance record I swore off Logitech and promised myself never to buy another Logitech.<br />Well, I happened to be at a computer shop that said I shouldn't be having these thoughts and was talked into a cheap Logetech M325 for the sum of $12 full retail.<br /><br />I was fairly impressed, I got 1.5 years out of that mouse before the buttons wouldn't work like the other four failures. It still had only acceptable tracking from new, but at $12 and 1.5 years with today's dismal manufacturing performance. It was not a bargain but acceptable, so I went against my better judgment and bought another Logitech. An M 510, (because I liked its feature set).<br />I hada fresh load of Win 7 and a brand new mouse, things looked good except for slightly erratic mouse movement that I attributed to a white table surface and no mouse pad (I now live on a small boat and use the drop down table as a mouse pad).<br />Well things got worse as weeks went by. Because I liked the M 510 features I scoured the internet again to find fixes for the logitech mouse:<br />I:<br />Demagnetized<br />Adjusted settings.<br />Downloaded drivers.<br />Deleted Setpoint.<br />Installed old versions of Setpoint.<br />Uninstalled programs.<br />Laughed at some of the fixes.<br />Cried at some of the fixes.<br /><br />The mouse only got worse, until tracking was a joke. The M 510 can no longer be considered an interface device. I guess coupled with the worlds smartest operating system Windows, (Quote from Bill Gates.) It developed a mind of it's own.<br />Time frame??? How about 1.5 months!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I've called Logitech, they said they never heard of these problems before???????? Huh: The internet is full of Logitech fixes. Logitech's solution: Demagnetize, Demagnetize, Demagnetize , Demagnetize , Demagnetize , Demagnetize.<br />And if that doesn't work , Demagnetize. As if it could never be a mechanical problem!!<br />(Guess if you think I'm off Logitech for good this time. My Google search is now Mouse ---logitech. (That's 3 minuses), in case Google doesn't get it the first time)<br /><br />The only way I can figure Logitech gets all the 5 star reviews is that it found writing reviews a more cost effective method of doing business than &#34;Building a Better Mouse Trap&#34;.<br /><br />(This document was written with the aid of a Radio Shack Gigaware $8 mouse, which I have to have as backup for high end &#34;performance mice&#34;.)<br />I have now given up on feature sets and focused on pure cost criteria and no cordless. At least the cheaper cost factor last longer??",

Once it reset, the PC used to configure it through Ethernet port runing IE Browser lost connection, then I have to wait for the lengthy bootup sequence before IE browser can connect it, then it failed to establish ADSL dail-up again, then RESET, then .... This happened just like a dead loop until I unpluged the ADSL modem. <br /> <br />After all night failure, I downgraded it to be an AP(instead of an IP sharing router that it supposed to be) and used WinXP to do the PPPOE job, then everything was just fine (even with strong AES security ON, but I just tried G band, not A band). But why you pay extra for this useless \\\\\"router\\\\\" feature? <br /> <br />Its PPPOE protocol definately has bug, and the RESET-system-upon-WAN-failure problem make this bug un-tolerable.",

The touch screen isn't really a touch screen. More like a push screen where it takes forever for something to highlight to write in the text box.

Just don't be cheap (even for your children) and buy the real thing-Kindle or an Ipad. I know it's super expensive and people (like me) buy this to stay on the cheap side of life.

The Toshiba Tablet sees the SSID, but could not authenticate, until I rebooted the tablet(I think the issue is more with the piece of junk Tosihba tablet than anything else).<br /><br />Samsung UN60F7100 LED 60\\\\\" Smart TV:<br />I tried connecting the smart TV to the extender, but to no avail. Until I spoke with D-Link's tech support personnel ID AR004204, he suggested first upgrading the extender's firmware from 1.1something to the latest 1.21B01 RevA2(must search online for it and not rely on the self latest firmware check). They said that some of those TVs will not work, possibly due to different frequencies that those TVs are using, since the DAP-1320 uses 2.4Ghz, while some TVs uses 5.something Ghz. Looking at the specs on my Samsung TV, I was not able to find out what Ghz it was using, but right after updating the firmware on the extender, the TV suddenly started working with the extender. Then I also updated the TV's software to the latest and it's still working just fine. All is well now, happy!<br /><br />Down stream test with Nook & Android Tablet:<br />Connecting the devices directly to the router from about 40 ft away, I was getting an average of about 3-5 Mbps. Set the extender to different locations(not the sweet spot) and gotten the same result. Then moved the extender a little closer to the router at less than 40 ft(finding the sweet spot), now the devices are getting an average of 12Mbps, even at 40 ft away.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Maybe a little confusing to setup at first, but once you figure out that sweet spot, it's all good. One thing you need to know, is that once you connect your device to the extender, it's gonna get the transmission strength from the extender and not the router(e.g. If you are connected to a router that is a few feet away from the device, you obviously will get better reception, but because you are now connected to the extender that is further away, the reception is not as good, but that is the compromise of being more versatile with your device at different distances. Or, just switch between the different SSID, depending on where you are going to be at).<br /><br />I know what needs to be improved to make an ultimate product, but I need to be paid as an high end CEO with a golden parachute before I can give my advice.<br /><br />>>UPDATE 6/16/2014<br /><br />The android tablet sees the SSID, but just could not connect to it, even after rebooting the tablet. I had to unplug and plug the extender back in to the outlet to make it work again. I've read other reviewers having similar issues. So far, as long as it does not happen too frequently, it's all good.<br /><br />>>UPDATE 6/18/2014<br />>>Downgraded to 1 star<br /><br />Why? Mainly the portable Wi-Fi devices will see this SSID with strong signal and when trying to connect to it, it just won't and will automatically switch back to the previous connected SSID.

I'd have to turn the mouse off and on again to get it to work. Needless to say with this occurring every couple of minutes it was of no use to me.

I have had it now for a number of months and have not needed to reset it.  Unlike a lot of other switches this one is wall mountable (screws are not included but most standard screws will work) which makes my install look so much better.  I was able to get very speed over old beat up cat5e cable, I have recently rewired my house with cat6 but have yet to preform a speed test.  I plan on buying another TREND network soon to expand my network.<br /><br />Somethings to note and explain if people don't know them:<br /><br />TRENDnet makes two different 8 port Gigabit switches, one with a power supply built in and the other with a power adapter.  Both seem to get good reviews and don't seem to have other differences so go with whatever is cheaper at the time you buy.  The power adapter one is a 90degree angel one so for most strip plugs it will not take up more than one space.<br /><br />This is a switch not a router, I have noticed in some reviews some people have left bad reviews because of this.  The difference between a switch and router is that a router shares the internet connection with multiple computers and in the case of most home networks assigns the IP addresses.  This device is used to expand the network.  This device will provide gigabit speeds between devices plugged into it even if the router it is plugged into is not a gigabit router.<br /><br />The \\\\\"green\\\\\" means that it saves energy by only using the power needed on each port.  A standard non green switch will send full power out over each port (enough for the max of a 100m cable run) where a green switch like this one will only send out the power needed for the length of the cable.<br /><br />Gigabit Ethernet \\\\\"requires\\\\\" at least Cat5e cable and uses all 4 pares of the cable (as opposed to only 2 with 10/100 Ethernet), you can try it on something else but it may not work right.<br /><br />This switch is what is known in the IT field as a \\\\\"dumb\\\\\" switch, meaning that it is plug and play and there is no configuration necessary, if you don't know the difference between a \\\\\"dumb\\\\\" and a \\\\\"smart\\\\\" switch it is safe to say that what you need is a \\\\\"dumb\\\\\" switch and this is a good choice.<br /><br />UPDATE ON July 29, 2014<br />Switch is still running fine.  Have not had any issues with it.  I have also found out although cheep it has more memory than most name brands(close second to the Netgear prosafe).  People have successfully reported this switch working with AT&T Uverse set top boxes.",

My Apple charger had gotten the turtleneck of doom and I wanted to get a new charger that wasn't expensive and didn't have a 1.5 star rating on the Apple website (which the real Apple charger has). And when I first got this charger, it actually worked really well. My phone charged incredibly fast and I liked the durability of the chord. However, after about three or four months, that's when the madness started to kick in.<br /><br />It first decided that the only way it would charge is if the dodocool logo wasn't facing up. &#34;Not a problem,&#34; I decided. &#34;I'll only put it in that way.&#34; After a few weeks, it then further decided that I needed to unplug the USB out of the power adapter, plug it back in, and then plug in my phone--with the dodocool logo facing down, of course. I was starting to get a little annoyed, but I calmly reminded myself that I had indeed spent eight dollars on this thing and it had worked fine before. It was just running into some hiccups.<br /><br />I was wrong. Absolutely wrong.<br /><br />It finally stopped working all together unless I played this horrible back-and-forth game of plugging it into the phone, unplugging, turning the cable around, and then plugging it in again. It would soon take about a minute or two for it to connect, but as the days went on, the time extended. I was caught in a mind-numbing plug-in take-out plug-in process that would take over five minutes. And the reason why I've decided to write this review is because tonight I've been trying and begging and pleading and nearly crying over this stupid stupid charger for literally over HALF AN HOUR to connect with my phone. It eventually got to the point where the plugging and re-plugging became muscle memory and I was caught in adrooling daze that when my phone let out that celestial, blessed chime that it had connected that I had already pulled the cable out again. And that had happened to me three times.<br /><br />Three. Times. Three times I was caught in that stupid loop.<br /><br />I was about to throw my phone and nearly all of my possessions out the effing window.<br /><br />My hatred for this charger has increased with every single word I type. So please. Please, I beg you, do not buy this charger. It has put me through so much pain and misery, and I have nearly been drawn to tears because of this charger from the very center of hell.",

To give everyone some background, I purchased my kindle in late November 2010. About mid June 2011, the screen froze and had a lot of lines. Reset didn't work. I contacted Amazon customer service and they promptly replaced the kindle with a \\\\\"new\\\\\" one. I think they were aware of this problem. I was pretty happy at that time that the problem was resolved. I am not a heavy user (I read about 25-50 pages a week) and I kept my kindle(s) protected in a cover. About a week ago, the replacement kindle that Amazon sent me had the same issue with lines in the screen. When I filled out a form to chat to customer service person, \\\\\"lines in kindle\\\\\" is listed as one of the options for type of problem. This convinced me that Amazon is well aware of this issue with this type of kindle.  The representative who chatted with me, Jason, was very helpful in explaining that there is nothing he could do now that warranty has expired which was 1 yr based on initial purchase date of Nov 2010. He offered us an replacement option for which we would have to pay $65+shipping. I didn't ask how much the shipping was. He implied that the kindle must have been dropped or something to cause such failures. There were couple of issues with the deal. First, I didn't want to get another same kind of kindle only to have it fail again. Also, amazon would not offer any credit towards purchase of other kindle models (touch, fire etc). Second, to make matters worse, we would only get 90 days warranty on the kindle this time since it is considered a \\\\\"replacement/extended warranty\\\\\" deal. Finally, they took pity on me and offered $30 Amazon bookstore credit (which cannot be used for general purchases from Amazon). Now, why would I need that without an e-reader?  While I dont blame Amazon's service, I blame them for their inferior product. I am tired of electronics that dont even last an year. Shame on you Amazon. Enough with the Kindle.

I did a speed test and it tested at less than half the speed my network normally runs at.  Then I took it outside to test the range.  Somehow, it actually reduced the range of my network.  I tried the same with 2 phones and a laptop and got similar results: reduced range and very poor speeds.  That was all the evidence I needed to box it back up and return it.  I don't know if I just got a lemon or what, but I can't recommend it based on my experience.",

That, of course, would mean a ridiculous amount of money.<br /><br />Fortunately, I found an article that recommended this under-$30 device. To make it work with Mac OSX, it explained, you'd just need to download the free Pegasus USB-to-Ethernet driver (found at sourceforge, among others).<br /><br />Well, I got it today, plugged it in, and at first it didn't pull up an IP address. I called my ISP and went through a couple of simple steps -- something involving a manual setting in my network -- and soon up popped those beautiful IP address numbers. Who knows -- it might have just taken the modem a minute to figure it out and the settings I fiddled with might not have done anything. Point is, it worked with minor hassle.<br /><br />What a relief! Great product at a great price. (Would be even better if it came with the Mac software/driver - we're not Untouchable Fringe People, you know, Belkin!) ;)<br /><br />***ADDENDUM: When I upgraded to OS 10.5.6 several months later, the adapter continued to work for a couple of weeks and then it got futzy. It wouldn't work until I unplugged it and replugged it in -- every time I turned the computer on, I'd have to do this.<br /><br />I was going to buy a replacement but first searched the net to see if this had happened to anyone else. I'm glad I did -- it turns out it *was* related to the upgrade, and a fix was available in the Apple support/discussion forums.<br /><br />Again, Belkin: Please make your great product more Mac-friendly! One shouldn't have to jerryrig the software to get it to work.",

But, recently I have been dealing with a number of computers that were old enough that only the cheapest possible RAM upgrade seemed justifiable. Looking through the options of Amazon, KomputerBay consistently comes up as that cheapest option. Since Amazon has a great return policy, I decided to take a chance. I have bought two 2x1GB kits from KomputerBay now (one PC2700, one PC3200) and both of them have performed perfectly. I have not noticed any downside to buying this relatively unknown brand RAM. Given such good results, I heartily recommend KomputerBay RAM even if your computer isn't on that \\\\\"almost too old to justify upgrading\\\\\" line.",

The reason being that they usually get fixed by firmware updates.<br />To put it bluntly, almost a year of not being able to hold a wifi connection, having to reconnect Bluetooth on a regular basis (Others have these issues as well)<br />There is a seriously long list of issues, most all could be addressed by fixes in the firmware.  When I called Samsung I was told that I would have to mail it into a service center to have a tech look at it.  If they found something covered under warranty, I would not be charged.  And NO, known issues with the firmware would not be considered covered since Samsung intended to release an update at some unspecified date in the future.<br /><br />Also, Samsung does not provide a copy of the existing firmware.  What this means is that if you are trying to develop applications for Android or you install an application that is not from this Google Store and it corrupts your Operating System; you are now the proud owner of a brick.  I don't was to say it is a standard to provide a copy of the ROM/Firmware so you can reload it after a crash, but all other Android Device manufacturers do it.<br /><br />Now Samsung has released the Galaxy 2, so any hope that they may some day fix the firmware or even provide support for the Galaxy '1', are pretty well squashed.",

So, you can imagine my dismay when I pull my macbook air out of my protective case logic sleeve and find the corners of the moshi protector cracked, chipped and splitting apart.<br /><br />I contacted Moshi since it's been almost 6 months and they offer a free lifetime replacement warranty.  I explain the situaiton and wait for a reply.  Several days later I eventually get a response from a generic CSR rep telling me I need to email them photos of the cracking and a copy of my reciept.  A few days later they email me and tell me they are willing to replace the cover but I have to break the exsisting cover in half and send them pictures of it broken with my name writen on a piece of paper in the picture.  Only then will they send me a replacement that of which they cannot garuntee that the cracking wont happen on the new cover.<br /><br />Even though I dont use the laptop that often I am unwilling to have it unprotected.  I contacted moshi again and they told me I could pay for a second iglaze cover from their website and once I recieve it take pictures of the original one, email them in and they will refund my money.<br /><br />No go.  The process in dealing with their customer service department is stricly and ONLY handled via email.  There is no phone number to get immediate help or assistance.  I contacted amazon and was able to get an exception to return this much too overpriced cover.  Apparently you don't \\\\\"always\\\\\" get what you pay for.  I compared my $60 moshi cover againt my frined $15 generic amazon cover and asside from the cheap folding feet on the amazon cover the quality was nearly the same.<br /><br />This cover is going back and I will avoid all moshi products in the future.  What you are paying for is a name, not quality and if their business practices continue in their current direction the name soon will not be worth much either.<br /><br />If you don't believe me when I bought this cover it had 4.5 stars.  Now look at it, barely 3.25 stars and most of the reviews have been revised with complaints that allign with my own.<br /><br />Good luck, make the smart choice and get a better, quality product.",

I have had a few issues with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1st: The mouse is practically unusable. It will go in and out of connection like the batteries are dying. This happens while the mouse is less than 2 feet away from the receiver.  I have tried 3 sets of batteries, with the same effect.<br /><br />2nd:  The Keyboard has a similar issue of kind of fading in and out of communication. There is also a fairly noticeable delay while using the keyboard. If you are just using it for basic typing you cannot tell it that bad; but if you are using the keyboard to control something that is time sensitive, like a game or using it as a midi keyboard controller, you will defiantly see it.<br /><br />3rd: I tested the Mouse and Keyboard on 3 different computers, 2 running Windows 7 and 1 running Windows 8. The negative effects seemed to happen on each of them.<br /><br />4th: To give it the benefit of a doubt, I thought maybe I need to go download the drivers from the site. Hah! Good luck finding them on the site. I could locate my product, but there was nothing about a driver anywhere! All I could find was a paragraph stating that \u201cmost\u201d of their products did not need drivers and that your operating system should have one built in for it. Well, that really is true, it works with the built in drivers, horribly\u2026 but works. Note: The set did come with a disk, that might of had drivers on it; but me in my infinite supply of stupidity through it away with the box. meh...<br /><br />Pros:<br />Keyboard: I will say that the keyboard feels really great while typing. If you are doing nothing more than typing a letter, email, regular style office work, etc, the thing works great.<br /><br />Mouse: I really have nothing good to say about the mouse. I trashed it the 2nd day of use.<br /><br />Note: I did not test the keyboard with MAC or Linux, might later and update this thing.<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br />If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this item. Howbeit, mine could just be a bad one and others might work better; but after seeing how worthless their site was, I don\u2019t think I will buy any more of their products.keyboard with MAC or Linux, might later and update this thing.<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br />If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this item.

Knowing what I know now (you know what they say about hindsight), I sould have paid a little more and got one with better reviews, like the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9.",

Recently Asus released the 1005HA and I was certain that was going to be my next purchase since it was improved over the 1000HE.  I decided to check out Acer (blah), MSI(blah), HP/Compaq(blah), Samsung and Toshiba as well.    My main requirement was a good size keyboard, solid build, and great battery life.  Toshiba NB205 excelled at all my requirements.  I read every review I could find and even have google alerts set to Toshiba NB205.  Office Depots have this netbook on display.  Definitely visit your local store and try it out before you buy it.  Then goto Best Buy to try out other selections and order it from Amazon.com.    Some key points:    1. Keyboard - great size, the keys are similar to the current gen apple laptops.  I am typing this review on the NB205 so still getting used to it.  The only strange thing is the ~ key sits to the left of the space bar instead of the ALT key.  The ALT key is to the left of the ~ key.    2. Build - VERY solidly built netbook.  Does not feel flimsy like all the other ones I have seen.  I have a Dell XPS 1530 which I thought had a super solid build, this Toshiba NB205 is just as solid.  Construction and design are great.  I did not like the glossy covers and fingerprint magnet designs of the other netbooks.  NB205 has a matte cover and texture to it that does not attact ANY fingerprints.    3. Battery life - Reviews tested well and better than the Asus 1000HE.  Been using it for 1 hour and says 90% battery life after installing updates and downloading.    4. Trackpad - VERY large and controls well.  Glides smoothly.  No dinky trackpads like other netbooks.  Has 2 separate buttons instead of just one.  The pad is slightly recessed so it's easy to find it by feel.    The ONLY thing I dislike about the laptop is the 6 cell battery sticks out the back about .85 inches.    As for colors, ALL of the NB205 have the silver keyboard, the color difference is only on the screen portion.  I chose the Blue because I liked the color the best.  The White I saw in store looked very close to the silver keyboard color.    I thought about waiting for the ION, but the screens will be almost 12\\\\\" and the battery life will be worse.  Also, the cost difference.  I don't need a HDMI output either.",

            "input": "TL;DR version: Don't buy this. Ever. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.    Full review:  I needed a laptop because I was starting college, so after days of internet searching my dad and I settled on this laptop. Oh how I wish we hadn't.    What seemed good when this was compared to other laptops:   - Price (though this was only because it was on sale, as it is now it is DEFINITELY not worth the nearly $700 it's charging)   - RAM (I needed at least 6GB to work well with the Adobe programs I use like Photoshop)   - Decent hard drive storage   - 24 GB solid state drive   - i5 core was sufficient power for my needs    We were excited for the laptop, but a few months of use have revealed SO many problems.    What's wrong:   - Internet connection is temperamental. The laptop will say there are no networks available when 10 minutes later it will miraculously find 5. When there are networks detected it will only sometimes connect, other times when it says it's already connected it actually won't be so the page just keeps loading and loading. When it works the speed is average.   - Keyboard does have a bit of flex, it was weird at first but not that big a deal.   - There's no way this battery is 6 hours.   - The laptop does not feel very sturdy.   - The touch pad is screwed up. Big time. It'll jump from the top of a 20 page document to the bottom one moment, then make you scroll over and over just to move a few inches down the page. It will keep scrolling when you want it to stop, and has an absolute spazz attack if you have more than one finger resting on it at a time. Sometimes it doesn't respond at all. Seriously an issue.   - The biggest problem is that the laptop selectively shuts down. Whether you close the laptop or not, it's always a gamble when you come back to it (be it 5 minutes or 5 hours later) whether or not the laptop has shut down. I learned the hard way to always exit out of documents when I leave my computer--I lost 150 pages of editing when the laptop unexpectedly shut down and corrupted the file to the point it was unrecoverable. I would guess it decides to shut down 1 out of every 5 times.      Overall, this laptop is not worth the money, especially when it's listed for nearly $700. Get a different laptop.        12/30/14 UPDATE:    I have had this laptop for a little less than a year and a half, and the computer has steadily declined.   - Wifi connect is still spotty at best and disconnects frequently, no matter how good the Wifi signal is.   - Battery life has reduced to about 2 hours.   - Something broke inside the laptop that held the two lower halves together, so when I opened the laptop (lifted the display screen) the lower halves would begin separating. As of now the only thing holding the laptop together is a piece of Avengers duck tape. Literally.   - The screen brightness display got offset from the button controls a long time ago, which I didn't care about enough to change, but recently the display has started to dim to black at random times, forcing me to restart the computer if my random pressing of buttons doesn't turn it back on.   - The computer now selectively shuts down every other time I leave it.",

Already wasted $30 on another headset before I learned this fact (with no help from the guy at Staples who assured me it would work).<br /><br />Anyway... this time I read all the packaging on this Logitech H760 wireless USB headset, and it plainly states that it \\\\\"works with Mac OS\\\\\".<br /><br />The set up was easy, though if I had to go into System Preferences every time I wanted to use this headset, it would be inconvenient.<br /><br />I quickly went into Skype (my main reason for buying this headset) and changed the audio prefs to indicate I was using the Logitech headset (which showed up as an option automatically). Called the Skype test number, and once again - the mic does NOT work. Grrrr.<br /><br />So I went to logitech.com/support as the included guide suggests. Not only is there absolutely NOTHING listed under the troubleshooting FAQ for this product, I also discovered that suddenly my wifi connection had seriously slowed down. Turns out having the USB receiver connected to my MacBook interferes with my wifi connectivity (and yes, I was using the extension as recommended).<br /><br />Once again, a product that states it works with Mac OS doesn't deliver. There must be a mic'ed headset somewhere that will work with my MacBook. Hearing music, Skype, etc works fine. But the microphones never work.<br /><br />If anyone reads this and happens to know a headset that will work for me - please comment. Much appreciated :)",

But it's not the same quality - the silver stylus is significantly worse in quality than the original black Targus stylus.<br /><br />The silver stylus looks exactly the same as it does in the picture. My original black Targus stylus had the metal part that said \\\\\"Targus\\\\\" on it. The silver one doesn't. I knew when I bought it they would be different - I just didn't realize that also meant the quality would also be drastically different. Just FYI, when looking for Targus stylus to buy, pick a stylus that has the \\\\\"Targus\\\\\" on the metal part in the picture.<br /><br />This silver stylus also doesn't write as smoothly as the black Targus stylus (I stopped using my black one since I had scratched up the tip pretty badly by accident) does. I liked with the original Targus stylus how responsive it was. I didn't need to apply any pressure to write anything on my iPad (I used Notability and Draw Something and both aren't as responsive with the silver stylus). With the silver one, I have to apply a bit of pressure and my hand cramps up after long days in the lecture hall.<br /><br />Length-wise, my black Targus stylus is longer. They weigh about the same. I didn't measure the exact length, because the length doesn't really bother me at all.<br /><br />EDIT 7/1/14: It's been a while since I've used the silver \\\\\"Targus\\\\\" stylus. It crapped out after a couple of months (technically ~1 month of heavy use) as my iPad barely responds to it. It also leaves black marks all over the screen and now the tip itself seems to be disintegrating/thinning out without me even using it at all anymore. My previous black Targus as well as other styli I have used have never ever done that, so I brought my 2 star rating down to 1 star. I can still use my old black Targus funnily enough - even though it doesn't work very well any more, but this \\\\\"Targus\\\\\" silver stylus is a piece of over-priced, cheap crap.",

Read the instructions and do just as it says and you should have no trouble! One thing I will recommend when applying...sit the device so the light shines on it from the side to where you can see any dust particles. It's amazing to me how you can clean it and remove all smudges and dust and in a moment's time, a dust particle falls from the sky onto the device. So keep a watch out for that. I had a couple under the skin but used the tape (as recommended) and got them out easily.  Seeing I've only used it with the screen on less than a day, it's hard for me to report on the longevity of the product. It does seem to show prints/smudges the same or maybe even a little more than without a screen, however I'll take the protection over smudges any day.  So far, so good and definitely recommend!",

But it is not perfect and there are some idiosyncratic aspects that I have encountered.<br /><br />I bought this wheel to play GT5, and Midnight Club LA and similar car simulation, driving and racing games on the PS3. It works for PC too but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />Quirky things I have noticed:<br /><br />*Whenever I first power up the PS3 the G27 does a full calibration by turning all the way to the right and then all the way to the left and then turning back to the right until it centers... but when I start a game (for example GT5) it does the calibration again... but this time it doesn't center... it ends up slightly slanted or crooked. Also, maybe its just my wheel but when the GT5 starts and it first starts to turn to the right to do the calibration thing it \\\\\"shutters/stutters\\\\\"... the rpm lights and the turning motion momentarily freezes and \\\\\"shutters/stutters\\\\\" during calibration, but only when it is turning to the right... and this only happens as GT5 loads, it doesn't happen during the initial calibration when PS3 first powers on....<br /><br />*The G27 claims to have a \\\\\"push down\\\\\" reversible gear. But I could never get the G27  to reverse with the gears. Also the whole thing can not be \\\\\"pushed down\\\\\"... so I don't understand what they mean by a \\\\\"push down\\\\\" reverse-able gear... you can NOT push the snifter down at all! There is no way to reverse the car using the shifter/gear because it won't even have the grooves to let you put it in reverse! The diagram on the shifter is not how it actually is... I can put the gear in 1, 2, 3, 4, and yes even 5... but the reverse does not work! It seems to be a fake position that doesn't even exists on the G27<br /><br />*It took me a while to figure out that G27 has to be put as controller #1 in order for it to be recognized and work in games like Midnight Club LA. On the Logitech website they list both the GT5 and MidnightClub LA as fully compatible with the G27 out of the box. This is not entirely true. It is not actually plug and play. At first I thought I got a bad/dud G27 until I had to Google for tech support online and came across forums that said you must put the G27 as controller 1 because it will be recognized in the game... but the thing is if G27 is in controller 1 spot, the ps3 controller itself no longers works in the game, even when I put it on controller 2.... what ends up happening is the ps3 controller becomes useless inside the game itself, meaning I have to use the buttons on the shifter/gear in order to navigate the menus and such in the game... This is annoying and a MAJOR hassle.<br /><br />*For the  Midnight Club LA the G27 wheel is WAY too sensitive and over-corrects too too too much. This makes it almost impossible to accurately and enjoyably play. In GT5 there is option to adjust sensitivity of G27, but in Midnight Club LA you are SOL... Of course on the PC you have the drivers and software and can do what you want with the wheel, but for PS3 it is locked down and especially for games and titles like Midnight Club LA the G27 sensitivity makes it useless and it can't be adjusted.<br /><br />*The \\\\\"real leather\\\\\" on the wheel feels fake. I'm not saying it is not real leather... it just subjectively feel like synthetic leather... this is not exactly the kind of leather you find in a Lexus or anything...<br /><br />*There are too many wires with this setup... it is a mess and easily you can trip over yourself or worse someone trips it over and damages your G27... it makes it worse that the wires are so short... if you have a large TV and want to sit back a bit from the TV you run the chance of accidentally pulling the wires out.... not good...<br /><br />*You really need to get a playseat or similar item for this G27 .. that will end up costing you more than the G27 itself. The attachment devices that comes with the wheel and gear is cheap quality plastic and cannot secure anything at all... I tried to secure it to my table/stand only to have the whole wheel free fall to the carpeted ground 4 feet below... cause the darn plastic attachor thing came unhooked and loose... the wheel is very heavy, so even a free fall of 4 feet could permanently damage it... I'm not sure if mine sustained mechanical damage or not... I ordered playseat with this device but the device came sooner than the seat... so I had tried to mount it to a table but really it doesn't work well at all....<br /><br />* There is no way to turn off the force feedback in GT5 for the G27. In the options I know it seems like you can turn it off... but in actual races when you hit something or run into rough ground the force feedback comes into full swing.... it is annoying, and it is powerful force feedback that makes you lose control.... especially when you are already drifting and trying to countersteer, the force feedback will make matters worse and cause you to lose concentration and then crash you on purpose.... In GT5 there is NO way to turn force feedback off! This means if you drive on the dirt road it will be impossible to maintain control, might as well use a ps3 controller...",

More precisely, the incompetence of what little there is.  A few weeks after I bought it, it stopped being able to connect to my pc and transfer files.  It says it's connected, but the pc just tries to install a driver update, and fails to do so.  So I did some research online, and found that there's an updated driver to install.  Finding it on the Samsung page was a major pain.  There are drop-downs in the page that simply don't work, for one thing.  Finally found the driver, downloaded, and it won't install.  It goes into a loop \\\\\"Do you want to upgrade?\\\\\" click Yes, \\\\\"Must uninstall the prior version in order to update.  Do you want to uninstall the prior version?\\\\\" click Yes, animations indicate it is uninstalling, then \\\\\"Do you want to upgrade?\\\\\" (same window as the first one) click Yes, \\\\\"Must uninstall...\\\\\"  No matter how many times I click Yes, restart my computer, et al, it just keeps looping through that.  Found out there's an uninstall utility that can be downloaded.  Downloaded it, ran it, got a message that it was Done.  Tried again.  Same loop.  Manually deleted every folder with Samsung in the name in both Program Files and Program Files (x86).  Tried again.  Same loop.  Manually went through the Windows Registry (after backing it up, of course) and deleted everything I could that had the string \\\\\"samsung\\\\\" in it.  Tried again.  Same loop.  Searched their support pages several times during this process.  No help there.  They seem to recognize that their software is complete junk, but all of their offered solutions result in the same loop.  Can't request support through their online form, because one of the drop-downs is empty, and the form won't let you submit it unless you select something from that drop-down.  Nothing to select, so it's a complete dead end.  Tried calling their support line a few times.  Nomatter when I call, I get \\\\\"all lines are busy, please try again later\\\\\".  Tried e-mailing them for support, but that didn't work either.  Tried asking for help in their support forums.  No replies.  So, I can only transfer files back and forth by uploading them to a cloud drive of one sort of another, or (for small files) by e-mailing them to myself.  The lack of file transfer is merely annoying. I can live with it, but it's certainly a drawback.  The misleading, false, unworkable, incomplete, and just plain junk support, and the software that gets into a loop and can't even exit gracefully, makes me say I can't recommend this product, nor anything else by this company.

I have almost spent more money on shipping than these headsets are even worth.<br /><br />Wish I could give these things 0 Stars.<br /><br />UPDATE 03/20/2013<br /><br />I have gone though 3 more replacement headsets.

Luckily, the inside box with the monitor was fine. It was packed pretty well in styrofoam. The monitor is big, it looks like a little HD TV but its sleek, thin and modern looking. You have to connect the small stand but it was easy and no tools needed as there is a screw with a pin built into it.<br /><br />Turning on the monitor is easy with its buttonless touch. I have mine connected via the dvi cable because my pc didn't have hdmi. The sharpness is really good and the contrast too. It takes a minute to get used to because the monitor is large and your not used to it but in a good way. Games look incredible on this monitor, the clarity and detail really show off what it can do compared to my older hp 19\\\\\" monitor. You definitely notice the difference between LED backlight and the old bulb version. I have it set for the full res of 1920x1080.<br /><br />I know i said its thin but its so nice to have a thin monitor like this take up less space on my desk. The only not so good thing is that its not VESA which means if you wanted to wall mount or use one of those posable monitor arms on your desk, your out of luck. Most people won't, but I used to use one myself.  Being this has such up to date tech i thought that was something basic it should have had.<br /><br />My games took on a whole new life because there is so much space to use being its 27\\\\\". Everything isn't crammed in like before. Another thing I noticed and its expected is that moving the mouse around takes a bit more because things are further away on the screen.<br /><br />Lastly, the viewing angle is pretty good for this monitor, I can see it clearly and with no shift in colors when far away and slightly to the sides.<br /><br />If you need a nice sized monitor and are looking for something thin with high HD resolution with great color and sharpness I really recommend this one. I think its up there with some of the nice HD TV's that are out there.the nice HD TV's that are out there.",

In the end, here's what I had to do to clone my hard disk - in case anyone should need this workaround:<br /><br />1) Use Acronis to clone hard disk (250GB) to an intermediary hard disk (normal 2.5&#34; external USD 2.0 hard disk, 500GB)<br />2) Swap the mSATA SSD in the PC into the new one (500GB)<br />3) Use Acronis to clone intermediary hard disk into the new Samsung EVO<br /><br />It works flawlessly.<br /><br />Avoid this product.

I am very pleased with the product and definitely recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/20/10:<br /><br />My Kindle was behaving itself just fine until I put this cover on it. Now, it reboots without warning and for no reason. Why blame this on the cover you ask? When I contacted Amazon.com's Kindle support with my reboot problem, the FIRST question they asked was whether or not I had a cover. You might think that customer service was admitting that the cover is a problem by jumping in with the solution, but you'd be wrong.<br /><br />When I asked the customer service agent he was *very* cagey about answering. He even got angry with me for asking if the cover was the problem. He kept saying he didn't know if it was the problem. I kept asking why he'd offer to take the cover back if it wasn't. When I asked if I could speak to someone who DID have an answer, he asked me why I wanted to know so badly. Huh? It was a weird and hostile conversation.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved this cover, but it apparently interferes with the Kindle performance, so clearly it is not worth having. Bummer.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/26/10<br /><br />I thought about it and realized that, if the cover is the problem, it has to be something to do with the metal contact in the hooks of the cover. I just covered them with Scotch tape (a thin layer) and re-inserted my Kindle. This was three days ago. I have had ZERO problems since then. So...I'm again pleased with the cover. I won't change the star rating because I spent money for something I then had to rig with tape. No stars when I have to invent a solution for a thing's design flaws.",

I like listening to podcasts or running YouTube playlists while I work on cars.  It is also incredibly useful to look for maintenance procedures and parts online without hiking back into the house.  I've used a homemade high-gain &#34;cantenna&#34; in the past, but my success was spotty.  I also wanted my phone and any other WiFi device I bring out to the shop to be fully functional.<br /><br />I had my doubts about how well this inexpensive device would work, especially since putting it halfway between the workshop and my router would put it in the middle of my yard.  So, my intent was to sync it up to my router and park it in my workshop.  If it didn't work very well, I knew that it had a standard WiFi antenna port (of the RP-N sort) so I could always plug in a high-gain antenna and point it at my house.<br /><br />First I brought it into the room where my router was located and synced it up, which was very easy using the WPS function.  Then, I brought it out to my workshop and checked signal levels using the Network Signal Info app on my Android phone.  At first, I was very disappointed with power levels that appeared unchanged from before I turned the device on.  Then, however, I realized that my phone might still be trying to connect directly with the router in the house, rather than going through the extender.  So, I shut WiFi off on my phone and restarted it.  I did the same on the old desktop computer I keep in the workshop.<br /><br />Both came back on showing a full set of bars.  Naturally, I was close to the extender which showed a strong signal, but was the link between the extender and the router strong?  A moment later I was streaming Netflix on my Android phone, and I knew that I had a good strong connection.  The computer could also now stream my YouTube playlists without any hiccups.  The device works very well and makes a very strong connection with my router!<br /><br />At the sub-$30 price point, this is an excellent device, and I'd certainly buy it again.very well and makes a very strong connection with my router!<br /><br />At the sub-$30 price point, this is an excellent device, and I'd certainly buy it again.",

However, I also have all sorts of things that connect to it, since I use it like a full-blow workstation.  Well all those cables made it such a pain to unhook my laptop and then hook everything back up that I almost never used my laptop the way it was intended.  It wasn't practical... until I stumbled across this :)  Now, there are only 2 cables the plug into my laptop - the power, and this, via a USB 3.0 cable.  That's it.  Everything else including the ethernet cable, both monitors (dual display works great), sound, and other devices plug into this little device.<br /><br />Now, one thing to clarify is that even if your laptop does not inherently come with dual monitor ports, since most commercial models do not, this device *gives* you that capability.  The only connection to my PC is the USB 3.0.  The Plugable provides both DVI and HDMI monitor connections, that work with your computer of the USB 3.0 link.  So the Plugable is providing the dual-monitor capability.<br /><br />To fully use it, aside from following the minimal instructions, you'll want to change your default sound to go to Plugable, and you'll need to configure your displays by right-clicking your desktop.  From there it depends on your OS, but in Windows 7 you'll want to click on &#34;Screen Resolution&#34; and then make sure your displays are set right.  For me, display 1 is the laptop's built in display.  Display 2 is the DVI, and Display 3 is the HDMI.",

The majority of the reviews were very positive, I was a little hesitant, but also excited because of all of the features described.  Out of the box it looked and felt great, but soon after that, I realized it \\\\\"ain't no Ipad\\\\\".  It would have a full battery, and 100% wifi signal, but would say no signal.  It would be fully charged, but would not come on. I had to reset it weekly.  I would use my Ipad at the same time as my husband attempted to use the le pan, but he wouldn't be able to get a signal, or it just wouldn't turn on at all. We use the pads to surf the internet and read email mostly. The le pan performes poorly at these simple task.  I was very disappointed, and upset with myself for wasting my money. I should have saved it and purchased the Ipad.  I could not in good conscious recommend this product to anyone.",

But like most networking, it is not trivial when you go beyond the most elementary setups. Suggestion: start with the defaults - it should start working with just minimal effort - such as find your own network SSID that you want to have repeated. Enter the WPA2 (or whatever passcodes you have, if any). Just take the defaults and play with it to get familiar with it.<br />The obvious things that matter are to ensure you have a good signal available to repeat. Then place the device (per the instructions) and see if you can get the new Wi-Fi signal where you need it.<br />I've picked up signals easily through walls, but metal walls (such as metal walled pole buildings) attenuate the signal you are receiving. I was pleasantly surprised to find the SR10000 gives a stronger signal than I expected - even through a number of walls to an out building easily 100 feet away.<br />When I read some of the reviews, I see some people express a lot of frustration. Very understandable - if you are a novice, allow some time to work with the system to get it right. Read the directions carefully and follow them - I found the instructions well developed and very helpful. But then, I have had some network experience years ago - to make me more tolerant with the latest twists on the technology. Patience is a virtue if this is new to you. But I think this device will please most people because it meets their needs to extend or strengthen their Wi-Fi.<br />[[ASIN:B005UBNGY6 Amped Wireless High Power Wireless-N 600mW Smart Repeater and Range Extender (SR10000)]].",

It does not work at all for its other claimed functions, such as public hotspot or \\\\\"direct mode\\\\\", which is the name eye-fi gives to the ability to upload to a designated laptop ( or even iPad ), which thereafter is supposed to upload to the EyeFi ( Internet ) center via whatever connectivity it has.<br /><br />We have been in extensive contact with Eye-Fi support, who are well meaning and nice and responsive but wrong.<br /><br />The problem is, I can already upload photos just fine when I'm at home.  It's when I am not at home that I want the eye-fi card to work.<br /><br />I am no neophyte at this kind of thing ( I work as a software engineer at a major computer company, and have for a long time. I have set up lots of wifi networks and computers and cameras.  )  I worked hard at making the Eye-fi card work, because I really wanted it to work for an upcoming trip.  I had seen warnings from some fellow engineers that it does not work, but hoped I could find a way around the problems.  I can't.<br /><br />The eye-fi software has simple-looking icons on top of a confused design.  Poor user interface throughout.  As an example, they call their application \\\\\"Eye-Fi Center\\\\\" and their web portal has the title \\\\\"Eye-Fi Center\\\\\" and the two are not the same, or even similar.  You need to configure both; one configures your card and the other configures their server, telling it how to handle any photos it gets from the card.  I think Eye-Fi is intentionally glossing over the complexity of what is underneath, which would be fine if it all worked.  But it doesn't.<br /><br />Customer service assures you that if  you only do such and so, it will work.  We have spent easily 20 hours trying to make it work, but its basic function is missing.  For instance, it cannot navigate the splash screen at a McDonalds wifi hotspot.  Therefore it cannot use its \\\\\"hotspot\\\\\" feature, which is supposed to automatically upload the photos you take.  Surprisingly, it also cannot handle adding a specific McDonalds wifi network as a \\\\\"private network\\\\\" as it calls them, or a known network, because even the login software cannot handle a splash screen.  And even more amazingly, if you enable \\\\\"direct mode\\\\\" and take your laptop along and have the camera right next to your laptop which is right next to your Egg McMuffin, it STILL does not work.  Nor does it tell you why.  What does finally work is directly inserting the card to your laptop.  The same thing you would have to do with a standard card.  But it demands the Eye-fi specific USB reader, and it uploads to the Eye-Fi center, which promises to delete your photos in 7 days.  Not a terrific deal as far as I can see.  And it will take you a long time and a lot of glib assurances and \\\\\"please take 5 photos and upload the log file and we will get back to you\\\\\" sort of interactions, which take time but don't end up helping.  They are nice folks, they are trying to help, they want it to work, but unfortunately it does not work.<br /><br />If you really want something highly automated for your home or other standard existing wifi network, it works great.  If you want to be able to upload photos when you are traveling, for the time being you are out of luck.  Me too!",

The mic works but is very very quiet. I use Teamspeak and i have to raise my voice sensitivity so people can hear me. When i'm playing a game people cant hear me. If the game has a mic boost then most the time people can hear me in game but some games don't have the option. Other then the mic everything else is great and i would recommend this.<br /><br />*UPDATE* 4/21/13 about 10 months after<br /><br />So today (4/21/13) the right side of the ear cup broke off at the joint point and was made out of cheep plastic. I look at the left ear cup too and seemed to have started to crack too. and now i have to get a new headset or just duck tape this one..",

If you do things such as video editing I strongly suggest this memory upgrade (if your specific system is compatible).  The compatibility document from Asus has not been updated in some time so I wasn't sure if these would work.  I suggest going directly to Crucials' website where the RAM Guy has tested tons of boards and modules. Type your board in and see what's been tested on it.    Also, I paid for next day delivery.

Also, the inability to organize the apps in the apps menu is completely unacceptable to me. Your choices are alphabetically by title, or by most recently used. This makes it difficult to find my apps as they don't stay in the same place and I can't put them in a sensible order for my use. Had I known this I never would have purchased the kindle in the first place.<br />The entire thing crashed on the first day of use when using their web browser - to the point that I couldn't even exit the browser and do anything else.Just had to wait it out until the machine completely shut itself down and then restarted itself (a process of several minutes). When using the Pandora app, once the screen would go black the song playing would continue but then it wouldn't go to the next song without turning it back on, rendering it useless for streaming music.  Charging time took FOREVER. We left it charging while gone for several hours and it STILL didn't get anywhere near 100%.  So disappointed.

From what I have seen on the internet, I thought that MSI was a good brand that built quality motherboards that were &#34;Military Class.&#34;  How I was wrong.  Installation went nice for a first time PC builder like myself.  However, during the installation of Windows 7, I encountered a problem when the computer had to reboot.  The monitor would enter sleep mode, but the actual computer would stay on.  It would then require a manual shut down and a manual push of the power button.  Since this was prior to any software being installed on the computer, I had reason to  believe that it was the motherboard.  Through further research on the internet, I found out that another person on the internet had the EXACT same problem on the EXACT same motherboard.  This person managed to solve the problem by simply purchasing a different motherboard.  After that I have returned this product.

I wish I could give no stars at all. This Moko case has many serious issues.<br /><br />First and serious issue of all, this Moko case leaves a black stains/smudges on the back of my Nook HD. My Nook HD was once white and now it has many stains from the case. And the stain will not come off. I tried removing the stains and nothing will remove it. And I only had this case for less then a month. I will upload pictures to Amazon to show the stains that this case did.<br /><br />Second issue, the sleep/wake function does not work correctly. When I close the case I still see light from the screen still on. Also when I open this case, somethings it will not turn on.<br /><br />Do not be trick by what BSCstore description says \\\\\"Only buy from BSCstore to get genuine MoKo(TM) products with Lifetime warranty and superb customer service.\\\\\" I tried contact BSCstore through e-mail but I have not get a response back. I contacted Amazon for BSCstore phone number and Amazon customer service told me that BSCstore has not updated their phone number. I can not reach BSCstore by phone number or e-mail, what is the use of advertizing \\\\\"Lifetime warranty and superb customer service\\\\\" when you can not get a hold of them.<br /><br />I have bought other cases before cheaper then this Moko case and it never stained or had issue with sleep/wake. This case is cheaply made. I do NOT recommend Moko case to anyone. Stay away and look for another case. And do not buy from BSCstore.",

There are 2 extra SATA data jacks and 2 extra SATA power connectors.<br /><br />I tried to find a place to mount the drive in this spacious tower but there are zero drive mounts.  I contacted HP technical support thinking that they could help me.  I asked where the mounts are and he told me that there are no mounts.  He suggested to connect the drive and leave it loose inside the case.  I told him that this is not safe and not an option.  Imagine a loose drive banging around shorting things out and HP having to repair it for free!  They need to retrain their CSRs!<br /><br />I asked if I can purchase an extra drive bracket.  He sent me a link to the bill of material for the machine.  I asked where the extra drive mount is in the list.  He said that they don't have one.  What was the point of him sending the list and wasting my time?  I asked what can I do.  He suggested to put it loose in the case.  I told him that is not an option.<br /><br />After asking for other options, he suggested mounting it external using USB.  I told him that I wanted SATA speeds not USB speeds.  Again for a third time, he suggested to put it loose in the case.<br /><br />I went to a local computer store.  I asked if they had any drive brackets that I can use to mount the drive.  He said that HP sucks for this very reason.  They would like to sell me a solution but there is nothing they can do.<br /><br />I went to another local computer store.  They suggested using velcro to stick the drive to the bottom of the case.  Okay, I was finally on-board with this less than optimal solution.  I bought the velcro and started to mount it but stopped when I realized that the SATA power connector is too short.  DARN!<br /><br />I went to a local computer store.  I asked for a SATA Y-Power cable about 12 inches long to reach the bottom of the case.  He said thatI was the very first person to ask for that.  He said that they don't have that cable only a Molex to SATA power cable.  That won't work because it does not have the Molex connectors. They suggested swapping the power supplies from my wife's old machine into the new machine.  I just bought a brand new machine and now I need to put an old power supply in it.  UGH!!!  I attempted to do this but then realized that due to the placement of the drives in the HP case, the extra connector won't reach from the C: down to the old D:.<br /><br />I am very frustrated.  I bought a tower so that I can put a data hard drive in it but this has been a complete screw up on HP's part. I don't know what to do.  It's too late now to return this box.",

Over the past two days the adapter has stopped working. My computer detects that it is connected, but the adapter will not connect to any network, and the blue indicator light flashes for a few seconds then turns off. I know this isn't related to the other issue because it will continue to do this even when I hold it in place. When I contacted customer support they informed me that the product was still under warranty, but in order to get it replaced I would need to go through troubleshooting first. This sounds fine until they tell you that if the product is more than 90 days old, you have to pay $38 to go through troubleshooting!

The plan was to later buy a heavy duty case when one was made. But i think we are just going to let her use this one and not worry with a heavy duty case. Its a very well made case. Altnough it wont really add the level of protection we really wanted with heavy duty case, it will protect from scraches and light bumps. I was worried how well the kindle would be held in place with case because the pictures appear there isnt much holding the kindle in there, but it holds the kindle so well its actually a bit tough to get the kindle out of it. So that is not an issue at all and it leaves the screen of the kindle uncovered totally for the best viewing experience. Im pleased by small things in life, but a feature i love it the kindle name in the case at the opening. Its a neat little feature. My daughter really wanted the KINDLE and not another tablet so i was happy to give her a case with that name proudly displayed on the front, seeing is how these are not things we buy for our kids often with that kinda price tag. I wanted to go all out. Another feature that is PERFECT for us is the slle/ wake feature. For an 8 year old she would never remember to turn the thing off so to be able to just flip it open or shut and it turn it off or on is perfect. The buttons on the kindle are very flush to the device so this case actually makes it easier to feel for volume buttons which made it a lot easier for her to find the controls. The charging outlets and everything are great because you can charge the device with the cover shut. The only drawback as others have mentioned is you have to find the right headphones to fit in the headphone jack. We bought kidzgear headphones and they do not work with this case. She kept taking the case off ( which she needed help with) to plug in her headphones. So she tried apple 's earbuds and they fit great with the case no problem so she just uses those with her kindle. Her grandfather offered to drill the hole bigger so she could use a larger selection of headphone but i hate to mess with the case that way, but we will see if tbe earbuds start annoying her we may take him up on his offer. But overall this is a great case that will offer a decent amount of protection and looks great.",

I started with the Thinkpad 600e, then the T30, then the T41, then the x61 tablet, and now I have an x220 tablet. I have owned docking stations for 3 of them. I'm a pretty loyal Thinkpad customer. I have a lot of experience with Thinkpad equipment, and my current and last Thinkpads were Lenovo-branded.<br /><br />I ordered this AC adapter because it appears in the picture to be a genuine Lenovo Thinkpad adapter. It does not behave like any OEM Thinkpad power adapter I have ever used. I received it yesterday (very, very fast shipping) and started using it today. When I plugged it into the wall, it sparked. That has very rarely happened other Thinkpad adapters I've used, and usually due to international travel. I didn't think too much of it though.<br /><br />I only got my laptop up to 80% charge when I smell this horrible smell: it smelled like burning fish! I started worrying that my oven is on fire, so I got up to check on it and my foot brushed against the transformer on this power adapter. Burning. Hot. The smell is coming from the adapter! And feeling the cable on it, it almost feels melty. Not good. I pulled the plug from the wall and filed for a return right away.<br /><br />Save yourself the time and trouble and don't bother with this. The one from Lenovo is twice the price and it's worth every penny of not having the worry of burning your house down!",

I'm surprised so few people noticed this error since 8cm would be a whole lot less than 20 inches.<br />Other than that, I fully agree with most of the reviews.  This is a fantastic mouse - great fit, great response, and I even prefer the weight of it over my old Intellimouse Explorer.  The only problems I've had have been with the MouseWare drivers.  Even version 9.75 (available from Logitech's website) didn't fix the use of the middle mouse button in Mozilla 1.2.1 for launching new tabs.  It just absolutely would not work unless I uninstalled MouseWare altogether.  So, until that's fixed, I'm going without their additional features (and losing the functionality of a few buttons with it).",

I actually was just looking at the reviews left by others because the system is built using a processor that I am considering using in a PC I build myself. The Processor scores well in benchmarks and is highly rated by the people who have bought it and when I saw that this pre-built system was so poorly rated it made me wonder why that is. What I then discovered is that with the exception of one every review is left by someone who, like me, prefers to build his/her own system and who also is unable to wrap his mind around the idea that not everyone is interested in building their own computer nor the fact that many people have enough money to be able to afford to pay others (like those same reviewers, should they wish to go into a computer building business, for instance) who know how to build PCs and enjoy doing so. Reading their comments I would almost think they were the work of only one person using different accounts because the sole complaint seems to be that this computer is sold with a markup of the price it would cost to buy the components and assemble it oneself. Odd that 4 or 5 reviewers should all be so single-minded and all so disregarding of the disservice they are doing to other consumers who are trying to compare computers by lowering the rating this product receives for reasons that have nothing to do with the quality or performance of the product. It doesn't seem to occur to them that the people who are looking at the ratings of pre-built systems will for the most part be people who have no intention of building their own computer and are not interested in doing so regardless of the opinions held by a group of rogue reviewers. Therefore I have given the system a five star rating in an attempt to return this product to an overall rating that is more reflective of it's value. I am not making an in depth analysis of the product but it has a processor that has received a great deal of praise and performs well when objectively tested. The people in the market for a computer and the seller of this system both deserve better than to have the ratings system rendered useless by people who either don't understand the point of that system or who are just bent on ... I don't know ... some vigilante cause devoted to promoting the idea that everyone must build his or her own computer? Hard to say -- it's strange.",

This is an OUTSTANDING laptop, with only a few cons that I will go over. But first, the good stuff:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* It's VERY fast! With the quad core i7 processer and 8GB of ram, you never have to worry about this laptop slowing down. You can run multiple applications at the same time, and it still won't break a sweat.<br /><br />* There's PLENTY of space! This laptop comes with an 1TB hard drive, though you only get to use about 900GB, after Windows 8 software is installed, it's still more than enough space for music, movies and games.<br /><br />* GREAT graphics card! Most benchmark websites will rate the \\\\\"NVidia GeForce GT 650M\\\\\" as a mid-ranged graphics card. However I have, Skyrim, Borderlands 2, Far Cry 3, Civilization 5 and many more games, running on High settings and I get 50-60 FPS with each game. For some people reading this and not understanding what I'm saying, it means I can run those games with High graphic settings and get smooth gameplay! Which is great for a \\\\\"mid-ranged\\\\\" graphics card.<br /><br />* NICE display! It won't blow you away or anything; however, the 1600 X 900 screen resolution makes games, movies and YouTube look pretty good!<br /><br />* TREMENDOUS price! Most gaming laptops can cost over $1300 or more! But for around $900 you're getting an OUTSTANDING deal!<br /><br />And now for the bad:<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* The lid is a little flimsy. I'm not saying it's going to break on you, but it's not the sturdiest lid I ever seen on a laptop.<br /><br />* The disc tray is also a little flimsy. Again, it's not going to break on you, I just think it's worth mentioning.<br /><br />* The battery isn't the best. I can only get about 4 hours off of this laptop when I'm using the battery. And that's not including when I'm playing games. If you ONLY want to get a laptop so you don't have to keep it plugged in for more than 4 hours at a time. Then DON'T get this laptop! Though keep in mind, that with MOST powerful gaming laptops (not including Alien Were) you're going to have a crappy battery life, no matter what.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a nearly PERFECT laptop and with such a low price with great system specs. There shouldn't be much holding you back from getting this laptop!you don't have to keep it plugged in for more than 4 hours at a time. Then DON'T get this laptop!

You're saving $200+ over box retail on a very high-performance laptop for its size and weight. I can chew through HD video on the go with this thing and it doesn't wince. No, you're not going to be able to play the latest Steam games with high graphics settings, but for those on the go with student or professional applications this machine is perfect.<br /><br />In the box are two things: The laptop and the charger. That's it. Why on earth would you want all the promotional papers and throwaways that come with a normal laptop from the electronics store? It's a laptop. It doesn't require a manual or all that trial software that you'll never use anyway. Speaking of which, the amount of trial and promotional software (bloatware) that I had to uninstall was minimal. Thank you, Asus.<br /><br />I will note that this is the second of these laptops that I've been through. The first one had a bad hard drive (kept locking up and screeching after a few hours of use) so I sent it back and got another. No big deal. Bum hard drives are somewhat common in refurbished laptops and it comes with the territory. It's an easy process thanks to Amazon's great returns policy. Just make sure you use it for a few days to test it out before you throw away the box and make sure you back up your files, as you should anyway.<br /><br />Let's get straight to the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros...<br />- In mint condition and has no signs of being a refurbished machine<br />- Lightning-fast startup time for a laptop with a hard drive<br />- Great performance and specs for the price<br />- Backlit keyboard is wonderful in the dark<br />- Keyboard types comfortably for the size and it doesn't bend in the middle unless you apply an unreasonable amount of pressure to it<br />- 3 USB ports (2 USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.0)<br />- Fairly quiet fan noise<br />- Battery life meets the 7 hour advertised length when in a balanced or power saving mode<br />- 8gb of RAM is a nice surprise in a laptop of this price point<br />- Charger has an angled plug that goes into the laptop. Easier cord management and prevents accidental bumps.<br /><br />Cons...<br />- Charger is small but bulky enough that it may cover up two outlets of a power strip. Outlets should be alright.<br />- Speakers are lousy. Bring a pair of earbuds or external speakers along if you want decent sound.<br />- It's a little clunky and heavy for use as a tablet. Buy this thing if you want a laptop that has a touchscreen, not as a tablet replacement.<br />- One port serves as a headphone jack and microphone input combined. USB microphones can circumvent this.<br />- Webcam is grainy and not of terribly high resolution.<br /><br />The pros outweigh the cons easily here. This refurbished laptop is one I recommend!",

There is really still nothing out there that can match the low weight, and compact size I am most concerned about(not being that keen on tablets). The MacBook is 4 times more expensive, and has only half(128gb) the hard drive space, two criteria that made me ponder the decision extensively, especially because one of my main reasons for getting one was to store photos on my trips. Now that I have been using it a while, I could hardly be more pleased. It is so much smoother a machine than the Acer, has the great start-up speed of ssd, a better monitor, useful back-lit keyboard, superior standard photo software, runs very, very cool in comparison, is totally quiet, is even a tad lighter, and has advanced track pad functions that don't have a mind of their own.

Hapens al the time unless I POUND the double letters intentionally. And again, the missed leters here ('Hapens', 'al') are hapening naturally.<br /><br />3. The keyboard is very loud and clacky as another reviewer mentioned. Probably caused by #1 above. I sit near a person at work that uses this keyboard and it is LOUD. She said her fingers have gotten stronger since using this keyboard, probably because she has to pound the keys. I'm actually considering buying her another keyboard out of my own pocket... Here at home, as I type this, I'm two rooms away from my sleeping wife, and I'm actually wondering if my typing will wake her up.<br /><br />4. They keys are recessed in a flush enclosure that has a rigid rim around the base of the keys. If you accidentally hit the edge of the left shift key for example, you'll hit the rigid edge, which is at the same elevation, and miss the shift. This is the first such keyboard I've ever used with this design peculiarity. I now know why keyboard keys should be raised instead of recessed into a flush case.<br /><br />On a positive note, it looks good. So if you are going for looks only, this is the keyboard for you.",

            "input": "Greetings Everyone,<br /><br />I bought this motherboard to replace an ASUS Rampage IV Extreme I bought on Craigslist dirt cheap. Unfortunately that one would not accept a bios update without first installing an i7-3000 series LGA 2011 processor. I read in some forums that some would flash via USB and some would not regardless of what ASUS said.<br />My EVGA X79 Classified did not post initially upon install. However, I bought this board for four reasons: Price, EVGA's United States Based Customer Service, The XL-ATX Form Factor, and reports that this board would work with my Intel i7-4930k right out of the box! I registered the motherboard online through EVGA's website and then called EVGA. Within two minutes I was talking to a tech support rep that spoke perfect English. I told him my problem and he asked if my motherboard box had 4th Generation CPU (Ivy Bridge-E) Ready written on it? I responded yes, and he told me to flip a bios switch at the bottom of the board to the left. Viola!!! It booted up flawlessly!!!!  I have a Crucial 960GB SSD and it seemed like my Windows 7 Ultimate 64Bit installed in less than ten minutes!!!<br />This motherboard has an interesting layout. I have a super-sized Cooler Master V8 GTS CPU Cooler and an EVGA GTX 690 video card. The X79 Classified is one of the few mid-entry level boards that accept a V8 GTS cooler without covering the PCI-E x/16 slot. However, my GTX 690 covers both the PCI-E x/1 and front audio header due to the board's layout. I can move the video card to the lower X/16 slot, but that puts it closer to the PSU and affects cooling air flow. So for right now, I'm without front panel sound until I get a sound card or move the video card. No biggie, since I use the system as a hybrid HTPC and gaming PC.<br />The EVGA GUI Bios is amazing!!! You can literally control every input and output on this board. Everything from fan headers, slot voltages, to SATA ports are controllable through the bios.<br />The LED post code trouble shooting display is a must for every computer. It should be a federal requirement!<br />This board skimped on internal USB 3.0 headers (only one) and the SATA ports by giving you only six, four at SATA II and two at SATA III. I bought cards to remedy both of those issues at less than $50 total. The red and black XL board looks great in my Cooler Master Storm Trooper Case with the clear side panel upgrade. A standard ATX motherboard would just be wrong for any full tower case with a clear side panel.<br />I think EVGA is friendlier to a wider range of RAM manufacturers than ASUS. My previously owned Rampage IV Extreme did not take well to my 16GB of Avexir Yellow LED RAM. I tried the RAM in my Gigabyte motherboard on another one of my HTPCs and I had the same problem.  The red LED CPU cooler and yellow RAM combination makes a nice pseudo flame effect inside the case. I\u2019ve gotten tons of compliments from friends and family.<br />Overall, if you have an Ivy Bridge-E processor, you cannot go wrong with this motherboard. It has less SATA and DIMM slots than EVGA's top of the line model, but adding $50 worth of cards brought me up to 99.5% of that board's capability under Widows 7 64Bit while saving me $80. The XL-form factor was a deal breaker for a full size clear panel case. I had to have function, form, and features at a reasonable price, and the X79 Classified came through with flying colors!<br />Thanks EVGA!!!",

I have reinstalled the operating system three or four times already due to this issue.  Spend the extra money on a real laptop.  This one is garbage.**  Tiny hard drive needs to be augmented with an SD card, which is also available on Amazon.  After doing a system restore, there were 11.7 GB free.  I believe it was closer to 3 GB free as delivered though.  Doing a system restore seems to have *briefly* eliminated the issue of constantly running out of HD space.  The small hard drive still fills up on its own - something to do with the WinSXS file.  Win 8.1 simply does not belong on a 19 GB hard drive (32 GB minus 10 GB fixed recovery drive minus 3GB mystery).  The recovery drive cannot be removed even after copying it to a USB memory stick.  The system restore will ask if you want to delete the recovery partition but will not actually permit you to delete the recovery partition even when restoring from a USB drive.  As a result, there is no way to use the 10GB partition dedicated to the recovery drive, leaving the buyer with just 19 GB including space taken by the operating system.  Finally, the mousepad constantly stops working.  Having a wireless mouse on hand is essential.  After 7 months the mousepad buttons failed permanently.  Save your money.  Get something with a bigger hard drive and perhaps a Chrome laptop if your needs are so limited.  **Update: Windows 10 absorbed the recovery partition and is smaller than 8.1, so the disappearing hard drive space is no longer a problem.

Setup is simple and then when it works, it increased range substantially over the Apple Airport that I was running. I hope to eventually set it up to work in tandem with my Airport; I will report here on the results of those efforts.<br /><br />Overall, there are just a bunch of pro's to report with this wi-fi router<br /> -Incredible range (tri-band allows for super fast short range and longer-range too).<br /> -Not only does it work far away but it works consistently. 6 antennas make for no observed deadzones.<br /> -Fast. Wifi theoretically as fast as wired connection. Most devices honestly don't feel the 1.3 Gbps max speed for internet because internet speeds don't approach the gigabit speeds in most situations (soon Cox will be installing gigabit internet in my region so I am looking forward to maxing speeds out). With the right devices you may feel it with in-network transfers<br /> -USB 3.0 outlet takes advantage of fast wifi speeds to have always connected external hard drive connected via the network. (also has a USB 2.0 plug which I have not used)<br />  -USB allows USB printer to become a wireless printer. This is not a unique feature, but a powerful one if you need it. I do not have any wired printers to have tested this with.<br />  -Backup software uses USB-connected hard drive to automatically backup my pc. I wish that my Mac would do it, but this is a limitation with the Mac not the router. If anybody knows how to automatically backup a Mac to this (like time machine) let me know.<br /><br />Cons<br />  -Size. The router is very large. I had to be creative on where I placed it.<br />  -Cost. It is expensive, but having consistent and fast internet and network connectivity should be worth the money for most people. It's expensive, but worth it in my estimation.",

I thought with the two fans (woopdiedoo on the lights) and having that extra USB port that it was going to be a good product for the work that I do on my laptop. Sadly, it was not and I am writing this review after having this product for two months.<br /><br />First lets start out with construction. Great on the top with the mesh. That's it. Otherwise it is horrible! The bottom is plastic and the lifter to be able to have the laptop at in angle was great for the first week. Literally on the 10th day the plastic snapped in half. It isn't like I have that heavy of a laptop in the first place (13&#34; Macbook Pro). For me that's a minor issue. As long as the fans keep on working I am perfectly content. Well within the first month I had this the &#34;lights&#34; went out and the far left fan kicked the bucket. So I am down to one fan and finally that kicks the bucket at the end of February. I tried it on my friends laptop just in case to see if it was something to do with my laptop. Nope.<br /><br />The other issue I had with it was the usb ports. It seemed to me that they eventually got loose within three weeks of having this product. Since it was loose, it seemed like that if I moved the cooler at all, it wouldn't read what was in the port and at this point I felt like if I breathed on the cooler that the usb port would not work.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Two USB ports<br />Noise level of fans<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not the greatest construction<br />Breaks easily<br />Died on me completely within two months<br />Loose USB ports<br /><br />I took a gamble on this product and lost.

Base(3):32 GPU:72 GPU Diode: 78 GPU Heatsink: 58    (Temperatures are in Celcius)    As you can see, the Cooler Master made a HUGE difference, especially in the CPU, and GPU. My game no longer lagged, and I was not worried about frying my $2500 computer.    I did a lot of research before buying this laptop cooler and I am glad I made the jump. The biggest selling point was that it did not draw in air from the bottom of the cooler, because I usually have it on an uneven surface such as my bed or sofa (which would have totally defeated the purpose of the cooler).    The Cooler Master is slightly larger in the front, but fits my Macbook Pro perfectly width wise. Some people complain that it is too loud, but I barely hear it; I don't mind the little noise that I do hear as long as it cools my laptop! The black finish and overall quality of the product is outstanding as well and does not detract from the looks of my laptop at all.

I explained in the first email what I have explained in this review thus far.

After I provided the order number again they offered to send a replacement part and I had stated that I can no longer use the part (nor would I want to) as the part ruined my motherboard. They again apologized and said that they will send the part, that I don't have to send the damaged one back, and that I would have to contact Amazon regarding the refund. Not once did Rosewill acknowledge or address that their hardware caused the damage it did.

The only good thing about this case is that the bottom half has openings to allow for ventilation (the Speck* case does not).  Even though the MacAir vents at the rear, near the hinge, this still seems like a good idea. However, my recommendation would be to spend the money on a more high-quality case that won't be too heavy and will be more easy to remove.

In a very short time the old roller system stops working and you then had to drag the mouse many times across the pad to make it work or the optical system stopped working and constantly needed resetting. With this mouse, I have had no issues whatsoever. It is smooth and has worked without a hitch. It is quite a large unit, but it fits my hand comfortably. It has a really cool Anker Logo light that can be changed to a multitude of colours. It comes with a software package which is better than anything Microsoft has created for its products. It is extremely precise and the DPI can be easily changed depending upon what you want. You can also use two separate profiles for different users, which is changed on the base of the mouse. It comes with very clear instructions and is easy to use. I am still finding the different settings this mouse has, but so far I have found very few drawbacks. The only problem I have found with this product is that it is a wired mouse, although it does come with a very long cable, other than this issue I love the product.<br /><br />At the given price, I think you will be hard bit to find a better mouse that has all these features.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.",

I'm currently attempting, through both the Better Business Bureau and my state attorney general's office, to obtain a refund for a defective top of the line HP desktop purchased new in November 2009. Since then, have spent a hundred hours or more trying to work through black screen freezes, sleep issue freezes, sleep runaway graphic card fan issues, and finally, a complete failure of the computer to recognize the RAID configuration, & resulting inability to access hard drives. With the latest failure, I spent five hours on a vacation day with their often unintelligible tech support, who finally wanted me to attempt to overwrite my hard drives - which were perfectly good - thus destroying all my data. 1) this wouldn't work, as the system couldn't access them, 2) I wasn't going to destroy my data. I was then referred to a supervisor, who tried to walk me through the same steps. I again refused to attempt an overwrite of my hard drives. Was then referred to a case manager, who, although I did not ask to escalate, kept repeating \\\\\"I am the case manager, you cannot escalate beyond me.\\\\\" She wanted me to send in the computer, and I wanted a refund. We hung up. Over the next week, I removed my hard drives and copied the data over, then wiped the drives. I called HP back, spent an hour waiting for referred 2nd level, who said I should have called the case manager, that he couldn't help. Told him I didn't have contact info; he said I should have been given it, but he'd contact her and I'd hear back in a few days. That was March 11. Today is April 23. Still waiting.<br /><br />Filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. HP finally contacted me nearly three weeks after they received the complaint from the Better Business Bureau. They called while I was at work, then sent a follow-up e-mail. I arrived home 1/2 hour after their call and immediately returned their call. Was told I couldn't speak to the case manager who called me because he was getting off work in five minutes, so they'd assign a 2nd shift case manager who would call me back. I hung up, then responded to the e-mail advising that I'd returned the phone call and was waiting for a return call. That was April 15. Today is April 23.

Thank god I checked it before taking on my trip to China to back up photo's.  So another trip back to the store tomorrow, wasting more time and more gas.  I can't tell you how irked I am.    Pros: NOTHING    Cons: Cost as much as many 500GB small extral hard drives (Seagate, etc...) and didn't work.  Wasted time and effort.",

The customer service is incredibly slow and I only received help after I sent an e-mail saying how disappointed I was in the product and that I was going to return it if I didn't get a phone call. This was after 3 days of being promised I'd be contacted, seeing as whenever I called their help line it wouldn't go through. After a week of trying to receive help I finally managed to use them for the first time. Great sound, fairly comfortable, and the mic worked fine. As soon as I turned them off however the pairing disaster started all over again. Now the headphones are stuck on and won't turn off, the pairing base just keeps blinking meaning it isn't connected, and no matter how many times I try to restart the computer, hold down the pairing buttons, or replug the headset it will not respond. I strongly advise going with another company. You will not get help easily and the frustration is not worth the brief moments of enjoyment when you get your product to work as advertised. If the company wants a better review they can call me as originally promised and have someone take more than 10 minutes to try and solve my issue.",

I like the click and clack noises but I have a friend with the o rings and I really liked them, so I decided to buy them. It took a really long time to do all the keys, but man is it worth it. I'm getting used to the lack of a clack noise, but because they're MX blues, the keys themselves are still very tactile and clicky, I'm not really missing out on anything. It doesn't make the keys mushy or bad in any way. I'm really glad I got the red o rings because I swear the distance difference is actually pretty noticeable, I wouldn't get the blue o-rings unless you want super short key travel.<br /><br />Note if you have a Razer BlackWidow (mine's a pre 2013 model), the +, enter, and 0 key on the numberpad have stabilizer bars that are facing the wrong way so they're damn near impossible to remove or put back. They unclip on the edge of the keyboard instead of toward the inside of the keyboard. I didn't bother with those keys since I really don't care about the number pad, although it's kind of irritating knowing that I couldn't get every single key. If you're super OCD just a forewarning.<br /><br />Also, it takes a while to put these suckers on. Make sure you have a good key puller, I recommend WASD's key puller, although this is entirely up to your preference. Also, I wouldn't bother trying to put the o rings on with your fingers, even if you're really nimble. I took a pen and unscrewed the top and it fit perfectly to push on all the o rings. It took a while but if I tried to do it any other way I imagine it would've taken forever.<br /><br />Even though the price is a little steep, as everyone else is saying, it's worth it. If you're even here looking at o rings for your mechanical keyboard, you know what you're doing and you know exactly what you want. Go for it.<br /><br />EDIT after a few months of use:<br /><br />So, today I was cleaning my mechanical keyboard and decided to take off the O-rings. I just bought another keyboard with ALPS switches that are very, very clicky and I wanted to go back to the original feel of regular MX blue switches while the ALPS keyboard is shipping. That isn't to say I entirely disliked the O-rings. I can see how they're awesome if you have a linear switch and you want to shorten your key travel distance. For that--they're perfect; and if you want a switch to be less noisy if you're in an office environment they would be great as well. However, over time, I missed the clack of the MX Blues. It's weirdly soothing.<br /><br />I'm not saying anything bad about the product, as they did their job perfectly. I tried them and simply discovered I did miss the bottoming out noise, so I went back to normal. If you know for a fact you like your keyboards to be noisy, you will probably enjoy the difference this product makes for a while, just for the sake of change, then you might go back to wonderfully noisy switches. Just know what you're buying and really consider whether or not this would be right for you.st bought another keyboard with ALPS switches that are very, very clicky and I wanted to go back to the original feel of regular MX blue switches while the ALPS keyboard is shipping.

Although there are few benefits to this over an airport base station with an external drive attached, which is cheaper and is upgradable. Mine did what it was supposed to do. It took me a while to configure it correctly with my Mac and PC but generally I had few issues. It would sometimes need to be reset and a lot of the firmware updates from Apple caused it to fail for short periods. It didn't really do anything exceptional considering the price when it first came to market.    Sadly, it only gets 1 star as there is no way to perform diagnostics when it fails. Mine failed last week, and Apple refuse to even try to figure out why, and will not replace it as my serial number is a couple of digits outside of the recall for the power supply problems.    I was amazed at Apples attitude. I tell them it died, first of all they say we'll send you a new one. I don't want a new one, I want my \\\\\"server grade\\\\\" back up source to be reliable. A new one means all of my back ups are gone. Luckily I don't need them right now, but that's not the point. So a diagnosis or attempt at repair would be more fitting, but they aren't interested, they will just send a new one. Then when they see the serial number is out of range, they won't even do that. So Apple think a two year old \\\\\"server grade\\\\\" back up solution should die with no explanation. They are sorry, but electrical devices sometimes break.    I N C R E D I B L E A T I T U D E    So as with the many hundred other people online with similar problems, the option seems to be to \\\\\"open\\\\\" the time capsule yourself, remove the drive, use an enclosure to get to your data, and then toss the white case in the trash.

I FINALLY got someone with Tech Repair with some understanding that told me it will work with 64gb and Customer Service is using information NOT OFF BLU Technical Official site and it is incorrect. It took 1 week to get RMA number with my 3rd call to Customer Service and speaking with Supervisor becuase the CS Rep told me they did not have a device like I was giving them the number for. The Supervisor said there must have been a problem with my SPAM filter and when I told them I have no filters and I have received previous e-mail from them the resent it. It is going back for repair and I hope I get it back before this warranty runs out! It came out of box with a problem and CS SUCKS. I am waiting to get it back but after having 4 other BLU products I am rethinking my choice! Sender was great and I got it before they said but they are not responsible for the product. I will update after repair.   14 days later I got it back and it STILL WILL NOT WORK with a 64 gig card. Personally I think it is false advertizing. Well, you can put a 64 gig in the slot and it will see it but it will keep ejecting and therefor it is unusable. I have 3 other Blu products so it is not like I have something against the company BUT I can honestly say my next purchase will not be a Blu anything. I currently have another of my Blu phones in for service. Also a 2nd return because it was coded wrong for repair and returned without a quality check. There is such a GREAT PROMISE for these products and even a need for a good lower cost reliable product but at this rate they will not be around long enough due to their own self created problems. I hope someone reads this from Blu as they REALLY NEED to listen to those that buy their stuff and are unsatisfied for solid reasons. In the past I have recommended Blu to many people...BUT NOT ANY MORE. RUN!!!HIDE!!! from this product!!!!",

This computer has everything the 1005 line has minus bluetooth (honestly, I don't think I've ever met a person who uses bluetooth) battery life (11 vs 14 hours, real world 8 vs 11 hours), harddrive space (160GB versus 250GB which is a negligible difference), display (matte screen vs glossy screen equal resolution), wireless (g vs n) and finish (matte vs glossy).     Now, that seems like a lot of differences, but all of them, save battery life, are pointless bells and whistles that do nothing to affect the performance of the computer (akin to putting a moon roof and a spoiler on a car and jacking the price up).     Battery life is the only worthwhile difference between the two models (maybe worth 60-80 bucks depending on what your plans are). It would have been nice to have wireless n, but most users probably won't notice a difference.    As far as the screen and finish go, I think matte is actually an advantage. A glossy screen is exhausting to read on in bright light. I'll never understand what the recent obsession with glossy screens is; they are murderous to the eyes. As for a glossy finish, your netbook will look like a piece of well worn packing tape after 15 minutes (big greasy fingerprints everywhere!).     I've heard a lot of people complain that the keyboard of this model feels spongy, but I think they must be typing with mallets, because the 1001p keyboard feels like every other laptop I've ever used. It does not depress in the corners or anywhere for that matter and I'm a fairly hard typist.     The first thing I did when I got this computer was clean install windows 7 ultimate and office 2003 (office 2007 being an unholy abomination; a grievous injustice perpetrated upon all of mankind). So far the netbook has been breezing through applications on 1GB ram with nary a stutter. I would highly recommend upgrading from the absolute garbage windows 7 starter, it doesn't even let you change the wallpaper and is solely intended to annoy you. Furthermore, you might as well get rid of all the asus software (it periodically generates pop-up ads asking if you want to pay for something) and just install the drivers for lan and wireless, you really don't need the others.     In conclusion (ah, high school english where would I be without you) The 1001P is a solid, surprisingly powerful little netbook with excellent design. It is more than adequate for most computing tasks short of video editing. And for 280$? Are you kidding me? How can you complain?",

Well I went with the more expensive model of Netgear router/modems because I am a gamer and me and my boyfriend frequently stream movies and videos on our computers and devices. I set the router up and it connected to the internet but the upload and download speeds were horrendous!! I was getting a upload speed of anywhere from 1 mbps to 15mbps download and 1-6  upload. So after trying several different settings through the Netgear router admin page I finally broke down and called tech support. I held on the line for over 30 minutes and when I was finally connected with someone they spent 40 minutes giving me useless advice making me wait 4 minutes between every one simple thing they asked me to do in hopes to get me hooked on a service package where they were given remote access to my pc to help fix the problem. The cost of that was anywhere from 40 dollars for a hour to 190 for 3 months. I would never buy another Netgear product again.",

A good deal of the compact size comes from the fact that all of the amplification is located in your PC or your powered speakers. The cables need to be hooked up to a USB port, as well as either a Line-In or Mic-In connector on your sound card. I can't find fault with the hardware, but the software has been a nightmare. <br />I've installed the radio on two Windows 98 machines and a Windows 2000 Professional machine with miserable results. I was never able to get on-screen volume controls to work under Windows 98, and after several weeks all of the software quit working entirely. Under windows 2000 Pro, everything worked O.K. for a couple of months, then I started getting an error message on start up that said that a number must be between 1 and (about 2 billion). All of the station names disappeared, and the volume controls in the D-Link software stopped working. Upgrading to new drivers resulted in the software being unable to locate the radio, even though Windows said that it was there and working correctly. Uninstalling the software still resulted in Windows trying to start it on boot up. Reinstalling the software was unsuccessful, as I kept receiving the 'unable to locate radio' message. <br />So, now I'm left with a [dollar amount] paperweight. Perhaps this is the reason that you don't see a lot of USB radios on the market. While it is a great concept, the software is definitely \\\\\"not ready for prime time\\\\\". If you really need to integrate a radio into your PC, you should probably look elsewhere.",

The cameras are supposed to be 802.3af compliant and are successfully driven by individual Linksys POE injectors, but could not be driven by this Netgear  FS108PNA POE switch.  This switch is supposed to be 802.3af compliant as well, providing up to 15.4 watts of power per POE port, except that it is supposed to have a maximum POE capability of 32 watts total.  According to Toshiba the cameras pull approximately 10 watts.  All of this adds up to this switch should drive 2 of these network cameras, but not 3.  In reality, this switch will on drive one camera.  When a second camera is attached it appears to drive it for a few moments, but then the second camera drops offline and will never power back up, even though the switch indicates that it is providing power on the second camera port, and the amber light indicating that the POE power available is below 5 watts never flashed.  If a third camera is connected, it will never power on, and the amber light flashes as expected.  I am an engineer and I spoke to both the Toshiba and linksys tech support engineers who claim that their products are 802.3af compliant and that the switch should drive two of the cameras.  They just claim that the fault lies with the other manufacturers equipment.  I tested all 3 cameras, and even purchased a second Linksys FS108PNA switch and obtained the same results.  Between all of this testing and the fact that my cameras are successfully driven by individual linksys POE injectors, I can only conclude that the cameras actually draw more than 10 watts or that the Linksys POE switch simply does not provide enough POE power capability.  Bottom line is do not purchase this product to drive a network camera unless you have some way to test your camera with this switch, or you can find someone who has already done so, or you only plan on driving one network camera and nothing else on this POE switch.  I was not able to return my switches, as ANTONLINE the seller would not refund my money.",

It also keeps the front cover closed even when being jostled in my crowded purse (since I carry my kindle everywhere)!

As other users have said, the key tops make the key spacing feel slightly different, but the spacing is actually about the same (if not exactly the same) as is standard for Logitech. The key laser etching looks fantastic, and the lighting for each key is confined only to that key with a very uniform brightness.<br /><br />The keyboard feels nice and weighty - not necessarily heavy, but it feels like it is durable. The quality of plastic used feels very high quality, not like the standard plastic you find in most keyboards. As stated, it comes with two palm rests. The one typically pictured is good for gaming, but it forces your hands into a slightly asymmetric position, unsuitable for typing. The second, smaller palm rest is the one I keep on the keyboard.

Considering this a fluke and perhaps the fault of the OS, I corrected the issue using Apple's hfsutils to restart the partition's journal. Within a month of this incident the drive became ripe with IOerrors at the physical layer. Some days the drive would be stuck on the G-Technology Red Blink of Death with a light and repetitive \\\\\"click\\\\\" sound, and this could only be resolved by holding the drive to a specific angle until the red blink and click went away and the drives re-initialized.<br /><br />These units, while fast and effective at first, tire quickly. In the G-RAID Mini series, the drives do not power down when you shut your computer down (even with a full ACPI halt). If using the USB option, the drives will only spin down once the AC/DC transformer is disconnected. When connected via a powered IEEE 1394b connection, as long as your PC or Macintosh's power supply is powering peripherals, the drives are still working. When your data is being trusted to Hitachi \\\\\"Deathstar\\\\\" drives that can be on for days-on-end, it's no wonder this series encounters problems.<br /><br />Do not rely on this drive and definitely do not rely on G-Technology's warranty; it covers a storage device and not your data. G-Technology does not repair drives nor does it attempt any data restoration service in the case of failure. If you get the Red Blink of Death, they will simply send you a new drive if you're lucky enough to be within warranty.",

I had problems with both computers in which I had to re-run the cd twice on each.  You might be better off downloading a newer driver off the internet if available.  Overall it works great as the customer wanted dual monitors with extended desktops.  The resolution is super good as well as the on card memory.  It does come with two additional mounts in the event you want to install it into a low profile computer case.  I am happy with it, customer is thrilled with it, I do highly recommend it.  Excellent price.",

It receives power and the Western Digital customer service says something on my circuit board probably shorted out and I will not be able to retrieve my files.  Isn't the reason you buy a external hard drive is to protect back up and protect your files on your computer.  This model totally defeats its purpose.
