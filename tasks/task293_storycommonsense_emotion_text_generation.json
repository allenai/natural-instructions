    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a context, a sentence,  and a character. The sentence describes an action or job of the given character. Also, the context provides more information about the sentence or the character. Your task is to return one of the emotions which are expressed by the Character in the given sentence. For that you can use the Context; however, Context is not provided in all the inputs. Also, in some inputs, there can be zero emotion; for that return 'None'.",
