Goldberg : Two issues preoccupy you: housing segregation and education segregation. Theyâre linked  obviously. To get to a place where thereâs actual equality in housing and actual equality in educational opportunities for African-Americans  what has to happen? Itâs not just a legislative process. Hannah-Jones: It is not. Though  equal rights for black Americans has always had to be legislated. Itâs never been willingly given. What it would take  if weâre honest  is a fundamental restructuring of society. Our public schools are not broken  but are operating as designed. Our public schools were set up to provide unequal  inadequate education for black children. So thatâs what they do.  Goldberg : But arenât the public schools just a downstream problem of housing segregation policies? Hannah-Jones: No. They are clearly linked  but whether you have integrated communities or segregated communities  we have school segregation. In communities that are gentrifying  the gentrification stops at the schoolhouse door. White communities want neighborhood schools if their neighborhood school is white. If their neighborhood school is black  they want choice. Housing segregation just becomes a convenient excuse. The problemâand I never use the phrase âwhite supremacyâ because itâs a word that people automatically discount as soon as you use it  but that is the problem. We have a system where white people control the outcomes. And the outcome that most white Americans want is segregation. And I donât mean the type of segregation that we saw in 1955. I don't mean complete segregation. I don't think there are very many white Americans who want entirely white schools. What they do want is a limited number of black kids in their schools.",

As the Man in Black was initializing his descent into his final decade — the wits and hurt of age setting into his vocals — the Heartbreakers were arguably peak Heartbreakers.

According to a recent study from Data & Society  47% of internet users aged 15 and older have experienced online harassment or abuse at some point. Thirty-six percent of all respondents reported that they had been harassed directly  meaning they had been threatened  called abusive names  or stalked. When a story goes viral  this experience is amplified. âThis idea of people coming together within specific affinity groups and behaving in ways that are really good for the âinâ group and terrible for members of the âoutâ group [...] thereâs nothing new about that â said Whitney M. Phillips  a professor at Mercer University who has been studying how people talk online for close to 10 years and who has written a book about online trolling titled This Is Why We Canât Have Nice Things. âBut having different tools means we suddenly have new superpowers.â Though online trolling has existed for years  experts like Phillips worry that the election of Donald Trump as president may embolden people who already harass others online. Trump has insulted politicians  media organizations  public figures  and private citizens on Twitter  which  in some cases  has incited his supporters to launch social media attacks on the people he singled out. He has spread and amplified skewed information and has tweeted falsehoods. âWhat do you do when the president is doing the thing that youâre trying to get average citizens not to do anymore?â said Phillips. Truongâs story became a battleground for different factions to debate their own views about the media and politics. While roughly 70% of the 100 most retweeted tweets about her contained insults against her  the media  and/or \"liberals \" a little less than a third of all the mentions from that same sample were trying to defend  Truong  (and a small percentage were not related to the story).",

            "input": "Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Mom is Positive . Late last week  I called my mom to get a refresher on a few of her recipes. I wanted to make rogan josh  aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower)  chicken biryani (chicken and rice)  and paneer with palak (spinach). But my mom  like so many Indian mothers I know  has always avoided giving me complete recipes. Even when I visit home and watch her  she somehow manages to divert my attention by  say  dangling in front of my face a gol gappa  a globe of fried wheat flour filled with chickpeas and potatoes and yogurt. Iâm always missing a spice  a cook time  a stove temperature. Iâm never clear if when she says âgingerâ she means âfresh ginger  about a pinky-size  cut into stripsâ or âginger powder  a teaspoon or two.â Or  if sheâs feeling really casual about a recipe  sheâll say  âAdd the usual spices â a mix of 5 or maybe 10 different spices that might be usual to her but are patently unclear to me. Salt? Does she just mean salt? Worse  her measurements are not based on any contemporary or commonly used metric. A teaspoon  to her  is the size of the white plastic spoon with the snapped-off handle that she uses in all of the containers in her spice drawer that originally came from Dairy Queen when I was 6 or 7 and abandoned a half-eaten Oreo Blizzard. A tablespoon  conversely  is anywhere between two or three of the âteaspoons.â A cup is the cup she uses to scoop basmati rice out of the five-gallon plastic tub in the pantry on the bottom shelf. It is unclear where the cup came from  but it is cloudy and cracked and significantly smaller than an actual cup. Every other measurement she has  then  is specific to her grocery store  to her homemade spice mixtures  to her butcher who hands her a hunk of lamb the size of a small toddler  leaving her to break it down into digestible and cookable pieces. âHow much frozen spinach do I need?â I might ask her  and she will answer  âOne.â One block  she says  as if I can go to a grocery store and say  âONE BLOCK OF YOUR FINEST FROZEN SPINACH  SIR.â I suspect some of this is intentional. Indian women â mothers  in particular â hoard some of their recipes  refusing to give them in full. So long as they are the eldest women in their families  they are the gatekeepers for these particular culinary incarnations that exist only in their kitchens. (A cursory Google search for a good chicken biryani recipe yielded ingredients like chicken stock â my mom literally screamed when I suggested this â or curry paste  something that has never once been in her kitchen.) Iâve started to do this too  refusing to give my boyfriend a complete ingredient list  even when I need help cooking  because I refuse to let him in on a secret I have been scratching at for years. Maybe itâs about making herself needed as a mother  or forcing me into coming home and beg for my favorite lotus root  a recipe specific to Kashmir that Iâve never found at a restaurant. Regional differences are lost  the little things my motherâs motherâs mother did in the kitchen get muddied â unless I ask. And I have been asking  for years  for as long as Iâve been away from home and have been trying to find my mom at the bottom of a 20-quart pot. All of this reduces my cooking to a kind of trial and error. Once  when I tried to make her rogan josh  I ended up adding three times the right amount of cinnamon; my lamb tasted like an angry ginger snap. Two years after that  she casually mentioned that youâre only supposed to use flat cinnamon sticks  and not the rolled up ones  which apparently makes a fucking difference. When I last visited  she sent me back to my home with frozen rogan josh in my suitcase. Later  when I defrosted and ate it  I picked through it  pulling out any identifiable spices I could find. At the bottom of my bowl was a dark ball the texture of soft wood. I cleaned it off and texted it to my mom with my trademark calm: â?!?!?!?!â She gave me the Hindi word for it  leaving me to creative googling to figure out what it was. (I wonât tell you; Iâve invested too much to give it up that easy.) Mom swears that sheâs not actively keeping ingredients from me  that she just forgets because cooking is so second-nature to her. This doesnât explain why sometimes sheâll add an ingredient to her list for me â a year ago  the rogan josh recipe had coriander powder in it â later saying something like  âWhy would I ever tell you to put coriander powder in it? Nothing has coriander powder in it.â Now she says itâs actually garam masala  but not the kind you buy in the store (she says this with her particular brand of derision usually reserved for âwhiteâ grocery stores) but the kind that she makes at home  fistfuls of unidentifiable brown spices hand-ground with a mortar and pestle. âI will give you some when you come home â she always says  but she is a liar  because she never actually has. Food has always been my momâs domain  so maybe it makes sense that she doesnât want to give me her trade secrets just yet.",

While roughly the same number of lawmakers in both parties are leaving their seats to run for higher office  just nine House Democrats are retiring outright or have already resigned  compared with 24 Republicans. (House members running for other offices often count as retirements  because itâs usually impractical or illegal to run for multiple positions at the same time.) Including those members who are leaving to run for another office  there will be 17 open House seats vacated by Democrats and 35 for Republicans. Democratic victories last November in gubernatorial and state legislative races in Virginia and New Jersey could spur more retirements among Republicans worried about the national political environment under Trump. And although Democrats must defend far more Senate seats than Republicans in 2018âincluding several in states that Donald Trump wonâall of the partyâs incumbents are currently running for reelection. The retirements of Corker and Flake  along with a Democratic victory in Decemberâs special election in Alabama  give Democrats an outside chance at retaking the Senate majority. In the House  theyâll need to pick up 24 seats  and the more Republicans retire in districts that  Hillary Clinton  carried last year  the more the GOP majority is at risk.

She and others clearly saw what was an opportunity. Before the war  women's colleges had taught women math and science but they were reluctant to train very many women because they knew they couldn't get jobs. And so when the war started  they were still skeptical about putting too many women into math majors because they just worried that all of this was going to be yanked away after the war. But I also thought Virginia Gildersleeve was very crafty. She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women. I was fascinated by the way they did see [code breaking and military recruitment] as an opportunity to expand opportunities for women even as they were worried that it would be temporary after the war.",

During Wright’s interrogation  which was recounted at trial in testimony by a local police officer  he claimed that  Hoxha  reached out to him via Paltalk and asked him if he was interested in Islamic State. Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State’s’ mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype’s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State’s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that naïve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that “if you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won’t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.”",

Teens arenât used to paying administrative fees or business expenses and so itâs up to their parents to explain that  unfortunately  100 percent of your income canât be spent on fun. School can also be a particular point of contention between teen influencers and their parents. Because of scheduling and travel demands  almost all young influencers are homeschooled  a fact that most parents I talked to accept begrudgingly. A few internet celebrities  such as Brent Rivera  are lucky enough to live near Los Angeles and can still attend high school while juggling work meetings. But even when geography isnât an issue  the social dynamics of high-school life can make it hard for these teens to function. Though they may have fan bases of millions online and spend long hours alone at home producing ârelatableâ content for other high-school teens  many of the online influencers in this piece say they have been subject to intense bullying within their peer group. Kids may be ostracized or judged by their âhometownâ friends once they reach a certain level of success online. Others have the opposite problem  and cause distractions when theyâre mobbed for selfies between classes.

Such top-down tactics might be enforced easily at live performances  as one of my research assistants observed firsthand at a Chris Rock show in Niagara Falls. However  as a daily ritual for high-school students  all-or-nothing digital abstinence enforced by an authority figure seems destined to backfire  possibly leading to rejection—or even worse  a legal complaint. In an attempt to tackle this disciplinary problem  I have been offering workshops to schoolteachers that riff on and revise the design Yondr originated. In the workshops  I provide a kit that allows students to make their own digital abstinence case  but with an obnoxiously loud Velcro enclosure rather than a silent  magnetic clasp. This semipermeable design—the Resistor Case  I call it—is intended to promote self-regulation  not authoritarian control. The Velcro acts as a gateway to conscience: It provides just enough resistance and noise to make its owner think twice before opening it. Michael I. Norton  Daniel Mochon  and Dan Ariely coined the “IKEA effect” to name the increase in value people assign to self-made products. With the Resistor Case  I’m counting on a similar effect  that students who fist construct and then choose to make use of their DIY phone lockers might be more compelled to use them. Of course  the kit will only work if the teacher provides a context for it that includes a discussion of responsible smartphone use. (The kit provides a series of cards to prompt this conversation.)",

Part of the problem is that what made Darling such an innovative character in the 1980s isnât what makes her so compelling now. And I fully agree with you  Adrienne: The moments where we see Darling undergoing the most growth and becoming most self-aware are all related to women. In addition to Opal  and her therapist  Iâd add her boss  Raqueletta Moss to the mix. Serwer: To go off your points about Insecure  Gillian and Adrienne  one of Spikeâs issues here is that the artists  he  helped influence are actually better at this now than  he  is. Which is whatâs supposed to happen! Even if itâs not something Spike would like to hear. White: I think thatâs exactly right. Serwer: I found myself most roped in when the show was lingering on Darling and her issues in the art world (the satire of which is funny and brutal)  and less so when it was focusing on the love triangle (rectangle?) the original film was centered on. Of her suitors  I found Mars Blackmon the most likable and relatable  in part because he feels like the underdog in a situation that involves a wealthy Wall Street type and a French-speaking model. Also  Anthony Ramos is really good at inhabiting the character. White: I was scared about how the character of Mars (originally played by  Lee ) would translate  but in the end he was one of the highlights of the show and unquestionably the male suitor who was best folded into the present day. Ramos did such a fantastic job of keeping Marsâs spirit of absurdity and geekiness while making him feel fresh and original. As for the other suitors  I found Greer and Jamie difficult to stomachâand not just because theyâre supposed to be obnoxious. Both characters seem to be relics of the 1980s in dress  in attitude  and in their assumptions about their place in society  and Darlingâs.",

When the couple repeatedly reminded the crowd of their new status as grandparents it was to suggest very different associations in voters’ minds. …Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s.  Juanita Broaddrick  reported that when  she  was a volunteer on one of  his  gubernatorial campaigns   she  had arranged to meet  him  in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute   he  had changed the location to  her  room in the hotel  where  she  says  he  very violently raped  her .  She  said  she  fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left  her  bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel   he  caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones  and  Jones says   he  sent a couple of state troopers to invite  her  to  his  suite  where  he  exposed  his  penis to  her  and told  her  to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met  him  in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that  he  groped  her   rubbed  his  erect penis on  her   and pushed  her  hand to  his  crotch. It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today’s accused men have experienced. Rather  he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation and it was willing—eager—to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.",

Reading the Titanic screenplay  itâs easy to tell which character  Cameron  wished  he  could have been: Even the simplest descriptions of Jack find a way to be adoring. One of Jackâs sketches âcaptures [Cora and her father] perfectly  with a great sense of the humanity of the moment.â Jackâs sketchbook is âa celebration of the human condition.â As Jack stargazes before his first conversation with Rose  he is thinking not just any thoughts  but âartist thoughts.â And as Rose begins to fall for Jack  we listen in on her first impressions of him: He âis so open and real...not like anyone she has ever known.â Remembering the iconic âking of the worldâ scene â one he later reenacted  to near-universal disdain  at the 1998 Academy Awards â Cameron described the kind of power  the kind of joy  that even the experience of commanding a vast and imposing structure â a ship  a movie set â couldnât necessarily allow you to feel. âYou see the power of [Titanic] â he said of the scene  âand you see the satisfaction of the officers who run the ship  and their domination of the elements. And then I take that energy and I give it to Jack. Heâs an artist. Heâs a guy whoâs able to have his heart soar. Itâs his ship  man. It doesnât matter that he doesnât have a dime. This is his ship  and his moment. He owns the moment.â To survey (and enjoy) the power of the vast system he commands  the captain â âa great patriarch of the seaâ in Cameronâs script â must stand on the bridge and look at Titanic itself. But Jack  because this is not his ship and not his dream  can stand at Titanicâs prow as it cuts through the water  feeling the sun on his face  and watching the dolphins that leap and swim âfor the sheer joy and exultation of motion.â He can fully experience Titanicâs power because he feels no need to convince himself he commands it â and then he can give it to Rose. \"I've been part of a film that's broken cultural boundaries â DiCaprio reflected in 2004. âI went to the middle of Brazil  in the rainforest  and the Indians there knew [Titanic]. It's surreal.â From the beginning  it was clear Titanicâs success transcended borders. When it finally left US theaters in the fall of 1998 â staying on the big screen even after it was released on video â it had made $659 million domestically. In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.) But Titanicâs worldwide theatrical gross was nearly $2.2 billion. In a March 1998 article titled âFan Sinks into Titanic Obsession â the Associated Press reported that a 12-year-old girl named Gloria had gone to see Titanic  at the only movie theater in the town of Castelfranco Emilia  Italy  every single night since its release  and that she would go on watching it until she couldnât anymore. She had seen it 50 times so far and wasnât tired of it yet; the theater no longer charged her admission  and â recognizing that the love of an adolescent girl is nothing to be trifled with â saved her favorite seat for her every night. âJack is cuter than Leo â Gloria clarified  for anyone who wondered.",

            "input": "Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Omata is Negative .  Omata ’s analog appearance also disguises all the electronics that make  it  work. “It’s hard to tell that  it ’s a computer on the inside ” Bleecker says. “People think  it  needs to be tethered to the bike.” Instead  a microcontroller  GPS sensor  barometer  and a set of motors make it work. After a ride   Omata  can be wired to a computer or wirelessly connected to a smartphone to download the same sort of data that its more obviously digital competitors make available: performance  distance  mapping  and so on. “Our ambition isn’t to get rid of the computation ” Bleecker explains  “but to hide it.” * * * These days  people try to hide computers by escaping from them  like I escape to my lawn. The machines “hide” inside offices or jacket pockets so their owners can accomplish other goals. In some cases  the drive to get away from computers degenerates into wistfulness. The word “analog” has come to indicate retro nostalgia first  a way of resisting or even abandoning bits in favor of atoms. Certainly  Omata risks such accusation. But the line separating analog and digital isn’t as clean as popular usage makes it seem. Writing in The New York Times in 2015  Rob Walker observed an “analog fever” in contemporary culture. A counterrevolution to the digital revolution. Walker cites the rise of vinyl records and the decline of ebook sales in favor of print as evidence of this fever. It sounds right to modern ears. But strictly speaking  simply not being a computer doesn’t make something analog. Analog devices represent information with a continuously variable portrayal of that information. They create an analogous depiction of a source signal in physical form. A mechanical watch  for example  measures the passage of time with a set of hands  driven by a loaded spring  that traverse the watch face. In the case of a bicycle  as Newman suggests  the crankcase moves the bike analogously to the rider’s physical exertion. Today  almost everything is a hybrid. Even seemingly analog devices are also digital ones. By contrast  digital devices sample a stream of activity at regular intervals  converting those measures into discrete values for manipulation by an electronic device. Since computers are the machines that usually sense  store  and manipulate the resulting digital signals  “digital” has come to refer to anything that makes use of computer technology. In turn  analog started meaning “not involving computers” rather than continuously representing a signal with a physical quantity.",

Are private schools immoral in this context?

Which is what happened all across the Southârather than share a public good with black folks  state legislatures decided to shut down public schools altogether and pay vouchers for white students to go to private segregation academies.

As the numbers expand  these so-called twin primes become ever rarer  and the presentiment develops that these were accidents  and \"that solitude is the true destiny.\" But then  if you count long enough  you'll find another pair of twins  \"clutching each other tightly.\" Giordano depicts with aching vividness the traumas out of which Alice and Mattia emerge disabled. Alice's ski fall might be only that  despite a permanently crippled leg. But we get horror seen from within: a father who bullies her  even if lovingly  into enduring the cold  the awkwardness  the fear of something she has so little taste for that she humiliatingly befouls her ski pants.

If you went back in a time machine and stood on the deck  this is what you would have seenâ¦ Second Officer Lightoller would be over there â¦ and Wallace Hartley would be leading the band in a lively waltz just there  a few yards away â¦ [and] slaloming between these immovable pylons of historical fact are  Jack  and Rose.â In this way   Cameron  wrote  âThe film comes full circle  from being a film about Titanic  to being a love story that happens merely to be set on Titanic  back to being about the emotional truth of Titanic after all. By feeling the fear  the loss  the heartbreak of  Jack  and Rose  we finally can feel for the 1 500.â After seeing Titanic for the first time  Harry Knowles compared the experience to traveling to the past through self-willed hypnosis  like the hero of Somewhere in Time. Titanic experts who visited Cameronâs set had the same experience in the flesh.  Cameron âs devotion to history was exacting  and at times excruciating: Every possible detail  from the davits used to lower the lifeboats to the carpet in the first-class dining saloon (recreated  all 18 000 square feet of it  by the same company that had manufactured the original)  was identical to what Titanicâs passengers would have seen. When the furniture being artificially aged for a scene recreating the wreck didnât look quite right to  Cameron    he  spent a day and a half working on the props himself. ( He  was supposed to be finishing the screenplay at the time.) â Cameron  wanted real wallpaper and things like that \" the movieâs head of physical production  Fred Gallo  recalled. \"I said  'Why don't you build the sets and have them paint on the wallpaper? No one will ever know.'â But  Cameron  would. Thousands of props  from ashtrays to teacups to forks  had to be stamped with the White Star Line emblem  even if it was impossible for viewers to see. The costumes alone cost $8.4 million. The chandeliers couldnât be Lucite   Cameron  decided  because then they wouldnât chime ominously as the ship began to tilt; they would have to be crystal  just as they had been in 1912. âThere should be a little brass sign right here that says âPush ââ  Cameron  said apologetically to Ken Marschall  as he led the Titanic expert through a doorway on D deck during a set visit. âIt was one delight after another â Marschall said of his time on Titanic.

You  yourself  have survived something by the end of Titanic; you have sat immersed in death  in dying  in questions about your own behavior in such a situation  and have asked yourself to believe in love in the face of all this â and perhaps have been able to. For that experience  we were willing to go back to Titanic over and over again. And if weâre focusing on the girls in the audience  then please â letâs really think about them. Who were these girls  and why were they there? Why was I? When Titanic was in theaters  girls of 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 shaped their lives around it  and fell in love not just with Leo  but with the whole story they had first found him in. We had a sense  maybe  that life as we knew it was not so different from Titanic: that we  too  lived in a world where society might have to fall apart completely before we could be liberated from the roles that gender and class and race forced us to occupy. In Titanic  Rose is freed not because her mother and her fiancÃ© die (they donât)  but because a microcosm of the world as she knows it collapses around her  and in that moment she realizes its rules no longer dictate her existence. They were never really real  of course â but now that she has seen the spectacular defeat of every system the society that raised her guaranteed would work forever  she can no longer even feel its laws governing her. Something breaks when you no longer believe that anyone  anywhere  can build an unsinkable ship. And if you canât put your faith in a system like a ship â or a government â you have to start directing all your trust  all your love  to the people around you. Titanic poses the question of what we can hold onto when the structures and beliefs we have built our lives on founder beneath us  and one of the answers it allows us to reach is: each other. We hold onto each other. Recently  a writer friend told me that this year  as the world has started to feel like itâs falling apart  he has found himself turning again and again to W.H. Audenâs closing lines in âSeptember 1  1939â: Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. In the past year  I have developed the same kind of relationship â have been taking the same kind of refuge  grasping for the same kind of wisdom â with Titanic. When I first fell in love with Titanic  at 9 years old  I wanted to be Jack as much as I wanted to be loved by him. I wanted the freedom he enjoyed: freedom that seemed to give him the ability to love so deeply and so selflessly. It was the kind of freedom the world around me said a girl could never have. But the world had also told Rose that  and she had found that freedom  in the end. Yet no matter how vast James Cameronâs abilities were  his imagination â big enough to bring a lost ship back to life; big enough  even  to let the viewer feel some sense of what 1 500 lost souls really means â still couldnât conjure a vision so radical that it could let Jack survive. If it were possible for  James Cameron  to imagine masculinity doing anything  in the long term  but infecting everything around it with violence and arrogance and greed and destruction  then Jack could have survived. If  Cameron  were able to imagine a world beyond the hierarchy of patriarchal control â instead of just spectacularly destroying one â then Jack could have survived. If he could have imagined possibilities for men beyond either blindly following the patriarchy or dying for its sins  then Jack could have survived. But instead  Jack has to die  and to love Rose in the only way a world of patriarchal masculinity  even one reduced to flotsam  will allow: by giving his life for hers. Beyond even Titanicâs unresolved questions about masculinity  the one radical possibility  James Cameron  seems unable to imagine is one in which partners can lovingly empower each other through a life lived together. This is where we have no choice but to do what he couldnât: to imagine such love  and live it. To focus on nurture  and let go of heroism. To know that love is the only way through. To say: Get on this board  you idiot. Thereâs room for us both.",

May  who voted against Brexit in last yearâs referendum  now faces the tricky task of holding on to the support of the so-called Brextremists in  her  Conservative party during the final phase of trade negotiations that could result in the U.K. leaving the EU but getting a form of associate membership  like that enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland. Since  she  took office after the referendum   May  appears to have kept the peace in  her  divided party by stringently refusing to propose any concrete plans for what kind of deal  she  is hoping to strike with the E.U. The fact that  her  party has been avoiding hard conversations  intent on satisfying the narrow majority of Britons who voted to leave the EU without having ever developed an actual plan for how to protect its economy after Brexit  was reinforced on Wednesday when two senior ministers admitted as much in testimony to parliamentary committees. David Davis  who leads the newly created ministry for Exiting the European Union  was asked to provide details on the dozens of impact assessments he previously said his department had produced to determine how leaving the EU would affect up to 57 sectors of the British economy. To the surprise of many observers  Davis  who had previously described the studies as going into âexcruciating detail â suddenly admitted that no such papers existed.",

The two men sent each other links to Islamic State propaganda material  including the February 2015 video that depicted the burning of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. They also exchanged information about how to buy guns online. As with most known cases of Americans travelling to join Islamic State  the internet proved a useful tool for  Hoxha . While it is often tempting to assume that individuals are “radicalized online” through their consumption of propaganda  this is rarely the case. More commonly  the internet allows people to make contacts with and plug themselves into pre-existing  real-world recruitment and radicalization networks. In  Hoxha ’s case  the network  he  found would encourage and eventually facilitate  his  travel to Islamic State territory. The court records show that prior to  Hoxha ’s departure  David Wright put  him  in touch with another American Islamic State supporter  his uncle Usaamah Rahim  and together they began helping  Hoxha  as  he  prepared to travel in the spring of 2015. The two men raised money for  Hoxha ’s plane ticket to Istanbul by selling Rahim’s laptop on Craigslist.  Hoxha  departed for Istanbul on April 6. A day earlier  Rahim contacted Wright on Skype with instructions from  Hoxha . “AsSalaamu A'laikum Zulfi asked me if you could delete his name off Skype ” Rahim writes. “But before you do it  if you have any saved messages to him go to ‘tools ’ go to ‘options ’ then click on ‘privacy ’ and click ‘clear history.’” These steps removed the interactions between  Hoxha  and Wright on Skype  but did not clear the metadata that would later be used in Wright’s trial.",

He  was one of the two best writers ever to serve on the court and was equal on this score to Justice Robert Jackson  known for  his  fine literary style. No other justice traveled so much and spoke to so many audiences in the United States and abroad.

She  served for 16 years in the Army and the Army Reserves.  She  served in Kosovo  among other assignments. As  she  prepared to deploy for Operation Iraqi Freedom  though   she  was diagnosed with cancer.  She  was eventually discharged. And  she  now runs Final Salute Inc. That's an organization that helps homeless women veterans  as  she  once was.  She 's also the mother of a son serving in the Air Force and is the wife of a former Marine. Major  thank you so much for speaking with us.",

She and others clearly saw what was an opportunity. Before the war  women's colleges had taught women math and science but they were reluctant to train very many women because they knew they couldn't get jobs.

But I also thought Virginia Gildersleeve was very crafty. She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

            "input": "Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Mom is Negative . I didnât poison anyone on Saturday. I made six  maybe seven times the amount of food intended  but Iâm content with that being my biggest mistake. (I did use a pressure cooker for the first time and screamed every time it screamed  and I forgot to add the almonds to the biryani but  you know what  fuck nuts.) After my guests left my house  I sent a photo of my spread to  Mom   and  she  called me later that night. âThe color was right â  she  said  paying me the highest compliment  she  could give me from 1 500 miles away. âSo  I guess you can do it yourself.â More frequently than I think is normal  I imagine what weâre all going to do when my mom dies. My dad will be completely incapable of taking care of himself (he once asked me to put his jalapeÃ±o potato chips in the oven to âcrisp them up some moreâ). My brother and I only call each other now and then  because  Mom  begs us to  so who knows how far we can drift. Iâll lose  her  as a tether.  Mom  doesnât talk about death; itâs too macabre for our pleasant chats. But I canât help thinking about it  an anxiety that started to ramp up in my early twenties when I noticed how little I am capable of doing on my own. I still call  her  to consult on how to appropriately wash a lace bra  and  she  still buys me leggings if theyâre on sale  and  she  gets this rare herb shipped in from India that I have no idea where else to get outside of  her  pantry. These gaps in my knowledge are terrifying enough  but what about all the things I donât know that I donât know? Sheer chai  for example  is the most disgusting product  her  home country has ever produced â but will I one day wish I knew how to make it? When you emigrate  you end up the last person to touch a lot of your family history. Somewhere along the line  weâll forget my momâs maiden name. Weâll forget what her actual name was before she changed it when she moved. Weâll lose language and the way to make a candle from ghee and a cotton ball. I canât pull all of this information out of her  and I canât carry all of it after sheâs gone  and I panic when I think about how impossible it feels to one day not need her. But at least I can try to cook. My momâs own mother died in India  seemingly suddenly  from a combination of declining health and crummy care.  Mom  was with  her  when it happened  but near the end my grandmother was confused and didnât seem to register that  her  daughter had flown all that way just to see her off. When I imagine my momâs death  I picture her perched on her proverbial deathbed  lucid but weak  about to die. Sheâll raise one arthritic finger toward me  motioning for me to come closer to her. âYes  mother â I will say  and kneel down so her face is close to mine  glistening with tears. âCloser â she will say  and I will press forward  taking her hand. âWhat is it?â I will ask. And with one final rasp  the death rattle of a long life winding down  my mom will wheeze out her final words  releasing me from a lifetime of trying to keep her as close to me as possible: âIt was just salt.â â",

If you truly wanted to equalize and integrate schools  you would have to. But you can go a step shorter than that. New York City public schools are majority black and Latino. But you can go to any of the suburbs around  and theyâre very heavily white. So in New York and all across the North  you could simply move into an all-white community and go to all-white public schools. And thatâs how you avoided desegregation. In the South  most school districts were countywide. So you either paid for private school or you dealt with desegregation. In the North  you didnât have to do that. The key difference between the North and the South is for the vast majority of the history of this country  90 percent of all black people lived in the South. The South responds with Jim Crow  by passing laws that restrict the movement of black people. The North doesnât have to do that. It has a very tiny black population. Itâs only once black people start migrating out of the South in the 1900s that the North shows its true ugly racist head.  Goldberg : Youâve described something that I actually experienced as a kid in the 70s. I was in a school system growing up that was about 60 percent black  35 whiteâthe local system right outside New York City. Very unusual. My experience going from kindergarten through 12th grade in that situation was fairly tension-free. People actually got along. There was mixing  there was interracial datingâ¦",

As  Chris Kennedy  campaigns for governor   he âs talked about  his  business successes.  He âs pointed to  his  management of the Merchandise Mart  âone of the great economic engines of Illinois â and to  his  role developing skyscrapers on Wolf Point along the Chicago River.  Kennedy   however  has not highlighted one of  his  biggest projects to date â a nearly half-billion dollar public-private partnership to build a convention center and Medical Mart in Cleveland. Local politicians  led by a longtime family friend  gave  Kennedyâs  company a no-bid contract and pushed through a controversial sales tax hike to pay for it. As the project got off the ground   Kennedy  told Cleveland residents the one-stop medical superstore would remake the Rust Belt cityâs image into a âDisney World for doctorsâ and draw coveted medical conventions to town. Instead  the project was plagued by accusations of insider dealings  secrecy and failed promises.  Kennedy âs company made millions of dollars  while residents are stuck paying more on items they purchase. Four years after the 235 000-square-foot Medical Mart opened its doors   Kennedy  and  his  company have long since departed amid criticism they did little to foster the original goals of the struggling project. Now rebranded the Global Center for Health Innovation  the building sits eerily empty most days â the glassy high-tech showrooms of its few tenants unstaffed and deserted. Subsequent management companies have failed to bring in revenue-producing tenants or the flood of health care trade shows once promised.  Kennedy  said  he  was only trying to help Clevelandâs leaders achieve their goals of a new convention center and a revitalized downtown.  He  said  his  company took on a project when few were looking at the city  and the long-term business plan shifted after  he  left. âIt certainly wasnât a secretive contract. It certainly wasnât done without public scrutiny â  he  told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. âI donât know what generated more press coverage in Cleveland.â âHonestly  did we pull a fast one? Did we slide one by?â  Kennedy  added. âNo  I donât think any of that happened. I think everybody knew everything by the time we completed our deal. Thatâs what I believe.â Cuyahoga Countyâs current executive  Armond Budish  told reporters last month that he could call the Medical Mart building âan inherited albatross â but chooses to remain hopeful the development someday will succeed. Tim Hagan  a  Kennedy  family friend  spearheaded the push for the Medical Mart when he was a county commissioner a decade ago. Hagan said he stands by his decision to support  Kennedy âs project but acknowledged the development has fallen short. âThe point of what we were trying to do is make the convention facility â¦ more attractive for outside investments to come in for events â Hagan said over coffee in a recent interview in Cleveland. âHas it worked out â¦ as much as we thought it was going to work out  immediately? No  I donât think so.â Heywood Sanders is an urban planning and public policy scholar who is critical of convention centers as publicly funded economic development projects. He has studied the Medical Mart deal for years and said Cleveland was blinded by its own misplaced hopes and the  Kennedy  mystique. âDesperate cities do desperate things â said Sanders  a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Sanders said no hard data existed showing that a Medical Mart would succeed or produce any economic benefits for Cleveland. âIt didnât make sense then  and it doesnât seem to make sense now.â David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. (David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune) Once a bustling industrial metropolis  Cleveland experienced a hard slide into Rust Belt decline during the 1970s and â80s. Its population and manufacturing base shrank as factories and mills closed down. One of the bright spots in the cityâs economic landscape appeared to be health care. The Cleveland Clinic grew over the past 40 years to be one of the most renowned hospital complexes in the world â rivaling the Mayo Clinic as a destination for affluent patients around the globe seeking out the best  most innovative care. The clinic campus sits several miles east of the cityâs downtown lakefront  which continued to decline over the years. Since the late â70s  some civic leaders held onto the belief that renovating the outdated underground convention center might be the key to making the city center a destination once again. The political and financial capital to make it happen never materialized. Investing public money in building convention facilities is often a divisive issue. Boosters often say if you build it  they will come; others say the investment rarely pays off. William Bowen  a professor of public administration at Cleveland State University  puts himself in the latter category. Convention center deals typically underperform their projections that spurred their construction  he said. âMost of the time  the valuation of the impact of whatâs built either doesnât happen  or â¦ they donât  as a rule  pay back the public coffers â Bowen said. âI think thatâs borne out by the majority of the research.â The hospitalâs involvement started to change the sense of possibility  and then  Kennedy âs involvement would put it over the hump  Hagan said. The consensus version of how the development came about begins with Dr. Toby Cosgrove  Cleveland Clinicâs longtime president. According to  Kennedy   Cosgrove wanted to leverage the clinicâs cachet to revitalize downtown Cleveland. Cosgrove declined multiple interview requests.  Kennedy  said a New York real estate executive who was Cosgroveâs patient recommended Merchandise Mart and  Kennedy .  Kennedy  said Cosgrove called  him  to discuss the potential for a mart geared toward medical professionals.  Kennedy  said in 2005  he  and another Merchandise Mart official met with Cosgrove and local and state economic officials at the clinic.  Kennedy  said  he  suggested the new medical mart be tied into rebuilding Clevelandâs aging convention center.",

To solve the environmental-noise problem  cities and their citizens should learn from the mistakes of the past. Targeting the noise of individuals is ineffective  antisocial  and fails to eradicate the noise that really hurts people: environmental noise. Solutions to that problem must be systemic  requiring a large-scale  collective response across many different targets. Despite her intentions  Julia Barnett Rice offers a model. She arrived at success only once she began addressing the marine industry at large. Similar approaches can work today. Instead of punishing individual transportation workers whose trucks may be too old  a more comprehensive solution could target the Department of Transportation  with demands to repave worn roads with the porous asphalt configurations used in Europe to reduce tire noise. Likewise  any move toward using renewable energy sources will result in a quieter environment  as coal and oil extraction are extremely noisy labors. At the local and state level  demanding funding for repairs and improvement to outdated transit infrastructure will greatly reduce the noise caused by trains  cars  and trucks. Urban-planning approaches to eliminating noise on a city-by-city basis can be as simple as taking a single lane away from cars and giving it to bicycles  people  or green space. Improving  expanding  and properly funding public transit removes cars from the road  both reducing the sound they produce and replacing it with quieter options like trams and high-speed light-rail. In architecture  acoustics should play a greater role in all structures  from mundane apartment buildings to the grandest art museums. Noise control should be a consideration from the very first planning stage  rather than tacked on as an afterthought.",

Gaga herself seems hungry to have her telling of an ordeal she did not personally experience validated by those who did. “Did I get it right?” she asks her grandmother  mid-hug. “Yes you did ” her grandmother responds. But she has a warning for Gaga  too: “Don’t become maudlin over all this.” For now  Gaga is asking not for applause but understanding. It’s never explicitly stated  but Gaga seems to connect to  Joanne ’s story in part because of  her  own medical situation. Iconography about hospitals and crutches and wheelchairs over the years hinted that the seemingly bionic pop star faced problems of the flesh off-stage. In 2010   she  told Larry King  she  tested “borderline positive” for lupus.  She ’s still feeling the effects of the injury  she  sustained in 2013  as seen in a Five Foot Two moment when  she  pauses rehearsals for  her  Super Bowl halftime show because of hip tightness.

Gaga’s particular ailment is an almost-literal rendering of Jamison’s “pain without a cause”—which is  as  she  notes  “pain which can’t be trusted.” A poorly understood but widespread disorder that seems to inordinately affect women  fibromyalgia is sometimes assumed to be psychosomatic. “Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?” read a 2008 New York Times headline about the first FDA-sanctioned drug to treat it. Gaga has said that she wants to help raise awareness and research dollars. During one excruciating flare-up shown in Five Foot Two  she sympathizes with less-privileged sufferers of the disorder: “Like  I don’t know what I’d fuckin’ do if I didn’t have everybody here to help me.” A few moments later  she’s looking straight into the camera. “Do I look pathetic?” she asks  tear-streaked  lying on a couch  a therapist massaging her. “I’m so embarrassed.” It’s a powerful moment because the stigma of pain is clearly part of the pain itself. But it’s also aesthetically striking. To answer Gaga’s question  she actually looks like she did in parts of the “Bad Romance” video—crying  stripped down  and oddly luminous. It’s a sign of fame’s power on the viewer: Whatever lengths she might go to put person over persona  the persona remains. * * * Pop music has firmly moved on from the phase of gleeful  Technicolor artifice that Gaga stood for at her peak. Contemporaries in wildness like Kesha and Miley Cyrus have done much what Gaga has done and traded Alexander McQueen creations for cowboy boots. They have also made a diaristic turn  harmonizing their music with their angsty  tabloid sagas.",

Here is the summary of the operation  from the Times: The director  Grigory Rodchenkov  who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians  said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes  helping to facilitate one of the most elaborateâand successfulâdoping ploys in sports history. It involved some of Russiaâs biggest stars of the Games  including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won two golds. In a dark-of-night operation  Russian antidoping experts and members of the intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine collected months earlier  somehow breaking into the supposedly tamper-proof bottles that are the standard at international competitions  Dr. Rodchenkov said. For hours each night  they worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp  passing bottles of urine through a hand-size hole in the wall  to be ready for testing the next day  he said. By the end of the Games  Dr. Rodchenkov estimated  as many as 100 dirty urine samples were expunged. None of the athletes were caught doping. More important  Russia won the most medals of the Games  easily surpassing its main rival  the United States  and undermining the integrity of one of the worldâs most prestigious sporting events. All of this  Rodchenkov said  was overseen by an officer of the federal security services  the FSB  and had the approval of  Mutko  and Putin.",

It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.â âHis character doesnât go through torment â  Cameron  later said of the role  âand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.â Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasnât his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron â who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984âs The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 â found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didnât think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay â\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . ââA three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by loveâs ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John âI know now why you cryâ as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. âBuilding Better Worldsâ is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameronâs Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies â or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men â and Titanic follows this example. Even if men arenât actively oppressing women  Cameronâs movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  youâre still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.",

Rodchenkov ran the lab at Sochi during the Winter Olympics  and what he did there was essentially what he did for Fogel  but on a more massive scale: helping dozens of athletes dope all through the Games while testing negative on every single test. The story he told to the Times and to Fogel would strain the imagination  were it not independently confirmed by two investigations: one by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and one by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Here is the summary of the operation  from the Times: The director  Grigory Rodchenkov  who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians  said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes  helping to facilitate one of the most elaborateâand successfulâdoping ploys in sports history. It involved some of Russiaâs biggest stars of the Games  including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won two golds. In a dark-of-night operation  Russian antidoping experts and members of the intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine collected months earlier  somehow breaking into the supposedly tamper-proof bottles that are the standard at international competitions  Dr. Rodchenkov said. For hours each night  they worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp  passing bottles of urine through a hand-size hole in the wall  to be ready for testing the next day  he said. By the end of the Games  Dr. Rodchenkov estimated  as many as 100 dirty urine samples were expunged. None of the athletes were caught doping. More important  Russia won the most medals of the Games  easily surpassing its main rival  the United States  and undermining the integrity of one of the worldâs most prestigious sporting events. All of this  Rodchenkov said  was overseen by an officer of the federal security services  the FSB  and had the approval of  Mutko  and Putin.",

If  Mrs Merkel  (for  it  would be  she ) failed to win an absolute majority in two successive Bundestag votes  which can be separated by two weeks   she  would go to a third vote at which a simple majority would suffice. Only then could Mr Steinmeier dissolve the Bundestag  triggering a new election within 60 days.",

White: For sure  but Iâd argue those arenât even representative of Brooklyn in this moment. Brooklyn is not the Brooklyn of the â80s or â90s (so  Lee  keeps reminding us). Mock: On another note  Iâm thankful that they got rid of the rape scene from the movie. I think the transition to dealing with sexual harassment and assault in the streets was the showâs strongest material  especially as it bled into Darlingâs art work  which helped solve some of her financial problems. The personal became political then became personal again. Serwer: I think part of the reason why that subplot is so strong is that itâs based on a work called Stop Telling Women to Smile by the artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh  who was also a consultant on the show. Fazlalizadeh put up a series of posters around Brooklyn with similar antiâstreet harassment messages she drew from women she interviewed about their experiences. Green: Spikeâs long talked about regretting that rape scene (and as recently as November). I agree  Brentin  that the show did a really good job of making sexual trauma an undercurrent without visually exploiting female charactersâfrom the street-art campaign to Darlingâs art student replacing Lilâ Kim with herself on the Hard Core album cover for a school assignment. With the âfree black female formâ as its thematic throughline  the show subtly deals with sex and trauma  complicating the idea of autonomy and who has access to it.",

Patients for Affordable Drugs launched earlier this year  and it’s already making noise. On August 29  for example  just one day before the Food and Drug Administration approved a groundbreaking new cancer therapy called Kymriah from the Swiss pharma company Novartis   Mitchell  was in a meeting with several Novartis executives to talk about its price.  Mitchell  did not know then that FDA approval was so imminent  but  he  did know that whenever Kymriah did get to market  it would be astronomically expensive. Kymriah is the first in the new class of therapies known as CAR-T  in which a patients’ own T cells are genetically engineered to go after cancer.  Mitchell  implored Novartis to price Kymriah fairly.",

By the time my ancestor set sail on the Mayflower  Europeans had been visiting New England for more than a hundred years. English  French  Italian  Spanish  and Portuguese mariners regularly plied the coastline  trading what they could  occasionally kidnapping the inhabitants for slaves. New England  the Europeans saw  was thickly settled and well defended. In 1605 and 1606 Samuel de Champlain visited Cape Cod  hoping to establish a French base.  He  abandoned the idea. Too many people already lived there. A year later Sir Ferdinando GorgesâBritish despite  his  nameâtried to establish an English community in southern Maine. It had more founders than Plymouth and seems to have been better organized. Confronted by numerous well-armed local Indians  the settlers abandoned the project within months. The Indians at Plymouth would surely have been an equal obstacle to my ancestor and his ramshackle expedition had disease not intervened. Faced with such stories  historians have long wondered how many people lived in the Americas at the time of contact. \"Debated since Columbus attempted a partial census on Hispaniola in 1496 \" William Denevan has written  this \"remains one of the great inquiries of history.\" (In 1976 Denevan assembled and edited an entire book on the subject  The Native Population of the Americas in 1492.) The first scholarly estimate of the indigenous population was made in 1910 by James Mooney  a distinguished ethnographer at the Smithsonian Institution. Combing through old documents  he concluded that in 1491 North America had 1.15 million inhabitants. Mooney's glittering reputation ensured that most subsequent researchers accepted his figure uncritically.",

Usually this means trading on the spectacle of suffering to sell pop’s ultimate commodity—inspiration. Beyoncé’s Lemonade is the signal example  taking the sting of infidelity to spin a tale of hurt and overcoming. Kesha’s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year’s Rainbow. Katy Perry marketed her latest album with an on-camera therapy session in which she cried about her “real” self wanting to be known. Taylor Swift seems on the verge of unveiling a more acidic survival story. “Victim to victory” songs are always in fashion  but the latest boom relies  more than pop usually does  on the feeling of authenticity. Adult listeners of drive-time radio typically know they’re in the realm of fantasy and commerce  yet fully enjoying the confessional-pop performance means buying into the non-musical narratives surrounding them. Beyoncé rolled her own child and husband into the Lemonade visual experience. “I write this shit  baby ” Kesha insisted on a recent single. You’re explicitly asked to believe that the gap between performer and person is negligible.  Joanne  already fit into this triumphant-confessional class  with Gaga singing about family members and friends by name and roaring  “I might not be flawless but you know I’ve got a diamond heart.” The meta-text  all along  was Gaga’s own career arc—a sense that  she ’d come down from the heights  she ’d reached from 2008 to 2013  stumbled with  her  third album  and might never recover. Glimmers of past traumas and family tragedy contributed to the pathos.  Her  medical troubles would seem to retroactively add in a new layer  though it’s unclear when  she  received  her  fibromyalgia diagnosis  and little on the album can be heard as an explicit reference to illness. Certainly the lyrics about healing through love on  her  post- Joanne  single  “The Cure ” now seem a lot less generic.",

Putin  like most people who survived the Soviet Union  never lost that vision of the Olympics as a proxy for geopolitics.

It found that despite a decade of unprecedented economic good fortune  of surging oil prices and rising salaries  of the glitz and glamour of its cities  the country was rotten at its core. In the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union  its infrastructure had crumbled and was never rebuilt. The glitz  it turned out  was just a patina of false prosperity.  Mutko  was unsparing in  his  assessment when the Olympic delegation returned  humiliated  to Moscow. âThere are a lot of problems â  he  said in March 2010. âOver the years  weâve frittered away our sport science and lost our human potential.â  He  noted that foreign athletes were trained by Russian coaches who had left Russia  and that in many sports  there was no new generation waiting in the wings. âThereâs also the problem of doping â he said. âSome of us can no longer think of preparing athletes without including doping substances. We began to fight doping with more conviction.â All of these  he said  âare systemic problemsâ and the Sports Ministry was working to solve them. âNeither I nor the Ministry of Sport deny our responsibility for the performance of the Russian team at the Olympics in Vancouver â he said. âWe will do a serious analysis  and there will be changes  both in terms of organization and personnel  on the basis of our experience in Vancouver.â",

Zhang: As you know  Novartis disputes the $200 million figure because not all of that money went directly to CAR-T for cancer or toward the specific therapy behind Kymriah.  Mitchell : We're going to send you a clip from a blog post by Francis Collins  the head of the National Institutes of Health  in which  he  explains the long history of NIH in building the foundational science for CAR-T. Here's our position: From 1993 until 2017  NIH invested more than $200 million in the overall science of CAR-T. Even the seminal paper that was published in August of 2011 by Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania was funded in part by the NIH. All of the makers—Novartis  Kite (which will become Gilead)  and Juno [other companies pursuing CAR-T cell therapy]—are standing on that foundational science. The taxpayers invested early when the risk was the greatest. Zhang: What do you think is a fair price for Kymriah? Mitchell: Well  we have run the numbers a variety of different ways. Now  the point is no one knows the real numbers except Novartis  so we go back to the statements in a Reuters article in 2015 where Kite’s chief financial officer said they thought the base price was $150 000 for treatment  and analysts at that time were saying [costs could be] up to $300 000. When we tried to model  we can’t get over $300 000. Zhang: Novartis did take two unusual steps when announcing the price of Kymriah. First  they pointed to a British analysis to say they actually thought Kymriah was worth $600 000 to $750 000 but they were going to price it lower at $475 000. And second  they said patients who don’t respond after 30 days to the treatment will not have to pay.",

Here are some of the highlights of the presidentâs unique brand of diplomacyâand its aftershocks. Tweet Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! â  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  February 2  2017 Background The âdumb dealâ the president referred to was an Obama-era agreement on refugees. The U.S. had agreed with Australia to let in 1 250 refugees who  under a controversial Australian policy  were housed in camps in the Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea and Nauru; Australia  in turn  would resettle refugees from El Salvador  Guatemala  and Honduras. By the time he sent the tweet on February 2   Trump  had signed an executive order that banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. (That order was blocked by courts  though the Supreme Court has allowed another version of it to proceed while litigation is ongoing.)  He  had also conducted whatâs now an infamous phone call with Malcolm Turnbull  the Australian prime minister  in which  he  accused Turnbull of trying to export the ânext Boston bombersâ and hung up. The call and the tweet were unusually hostile for an ally thatâs fought alongside American troops in nearly every conflict since World War II. Upshot Despite initial speculation  Trump  would back out of the deal  the first refugees from the deal were resettled in the U.S. in September. U.S.-Australia relations are holding steady.",

Richardson said that the contestants had met London earlier in the competition and that she loved how âwarm her spirit wasâ because it reminded Richardson of her grandmother. In hindsight  Richardson saw London's presence in her hotel room as a way for Banks and the producers to make her feel more comfortable for the closing interview they had planned. According to  Richardson   Banks recognized that they had a âmoment â said she saw a lot of herself in  Richardson   and said she would continue to act as her mentor. âYou would think that if you cared that much  you wouldâve been there more \" Richardson said. \"I didnât think she cared. I donât think she gave a fuck about none of us  except for the ones who made it big. But hey  it is what it is.â Richardson said the second exit interview was conducted just a few minutes after Banks and her mother left her hotel room. Richardson sported a bright pink tube top  dangling earrings  and a black baseball cap that covered her hair  making it obvious that the interview wasnât from the same night as the elimination  where Richardson wore the black getup. She seemed happier and more hopeful in that footage because sheâd been âjuiced up â as she said  in a sense  by Banks. \"Part of me did give up. I was being very disrespectful \" Richardson's voice is heard saying in the episode as she's shown  in that black elimination night dress  packing up her suitcase. Then  the camera cuts to Richardson in her pink tube top saying  \"Tyra really did care about me  her yelling at me. I have the utmost respect for her  'cause she could've easily said  'OK  whatever.' And  you know  'Bye.' That showed me that she saw deeply into me and she cared about me. \"And that's cool knowing that  you know  Tyra cares about you \" Richardson said with a smile across her face  as the camera faded to her in that black dress again  rolling her suitcase out of the Top Model house.",

            "input": "Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity James Cameron Jack is Positive . âI just wasn't used to playing an openhearted  free-spirited guy â DiCaprio told the Los Angeles Times shortly after the Titanic premiere. âI've played the more tortured roles in the past. It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.â âHis character doesnât go through torment â  Cameron  later said of the role  âand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.â Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasnât his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron â who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984âs The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 â found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didnât think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay â\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . ââA three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by loveâs ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John âI know now why you cryâ as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. âBuilding Better Worldsâ is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameronâs Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies â or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men â and Titanic follows this example. Even if men arenât actively oppressing women  Cameronâs movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  youâre still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.",

Sims: By  his  flaws  do you mean  his  stubbornness  and  his  bellicose nature? Wright: Yes  and his extraordinary will  really.
