It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a legislative process. Hannah-Jones: It is not. Though  equal rights for black Americans has always had to be legislated. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been willingly given. What it would take  if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re honest  is a fundamental restructuring of society. Our public schools are not broken  but are operating as designed. Our public schools were set up to provide unequal  inadequate education for black children. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they do.  Goldberg : But aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the public schools just a downstream problem of housing segregation policies? Hannah-Jones: No. They are clearly linked  but whether you have integrated communities or segregated communities  we have school segregation. In communities that are gentrifying  the gentrification stops at the schoolhouse door. White communities want neighborhood schools if their neighborhood school is white. If their neighborhood school is black  they want choice. Housing segregation just becomes a convenient excuse.

We have a system where white people control the outcomes. And the outcome that most white Americans want is segregation. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean the type of segregation that we saw in 1955. I don't mean complete segregation. I don't think there are very many white Americans who want entirely white schools. What they do want is a limited number of black kids in their schools.",

According to a recent study from Data & Society  47% of internet users aged 15 and older have experienced online harassment or abuse at some point. Thirty-six percent of all respondents reported that they had been harassed directly  meaning they had been threatened  called abusive names  or stalked. When a story goes viral  this experience is amplified. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis idea of people coming together within specific affinity groups and behaving in ways that are really good for the \u00e2\u0080\u0098in\u00e2\u0080\u0099 group and terrible for members of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098out\u00e2\u0080\u0099 group [...] there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing new about that \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Whitney M.

Trump has insulted politicians  media organizations  public figures  and private citizens on Twitter  which  in some cases  has incited his supporters to launch social media attacks on the people he singled out. He has spread and amplified skewed information and has tweeted falsehoods. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you do when the president is doing the thing that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get average citizens not to do anymore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Phillips. Truong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story became a battleground for different factions to debate their own views about the media and politics. While roughly 70% of the 100 most retweeted tweets about her contained insults against her  the media  and/or \"liberals \" a little less than a third of all the mentions from that same sample were trying to defend  Truong  (and a small percentage were not related to the story).",

I wanted to make rogan josh  aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower)  chicken biryani (chicken and rice)  and paneer with palak (spinach). But my mom  like so many Indian mothers I know  has always avoided giving me complete recipes. Even when I visit home and watch her  she somehow manages to divert my attention by  say  dangling in front of my face a gol gappa  a globe of fried wheat flour filled with chickpeas and potatoes and yogurt. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always missing a spice  a cook time  a stove temperature. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m never clear if when she says \u00e2\u0080\u009cginger\u00e2\u0080\u009d she means \u00e2\u0080\u009cfresh ginger  about a pinky-size  cut into strips\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cginger powder  a teaspoon or two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or  if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling really casual about a recipe  she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdd the usual spices \u00e2\u0080\u009d a mix of 5 or maybe 10 different spices that might be usual to her but are patently unclear to me. Salt? Does she just mean salt? Worse  her measurements are not based on any contemporary or commonly used metric. A teaspoon  to her  is the size of the white plastic spoon with the snapped-off handle that she uses in all of the containers in her spice drawer that originally came from Dairy Queen when I was 6 or 7 and abandoned a half-eaten Oreo Blizzard. A tablespoon  conversely  is anywhere between two or three of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cteaspoons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A cup is the cup she uses to scoop basmati rice out of the five-gallon plastic tub in the pantry on the bottom shelf. It is unclear where the cup came from  but it is cloudy and cracked and significantly smaller than an actual cup. Every other measurement she has  then  is specific to her grocery store  to her homemade spice mixtures  to her butcher who hands her a hunk of lamb the size of a small toddler  leaving her to break it down into digestible and cookable pieces. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much frozen spinach do I need?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I might ask her  and she will answer  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One block  she says  as if I can go to a grocery store and say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cONE BLOCK OF YOUR FINEST FROZEN SPINACH  SIR.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suspect some of this is intentional. Indian women \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mothers  in particular \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hoard some of their recipes  refusing to give them in full. So long as they are the eldest women in their families  they are the gatekeepers for these particular culinary incarnations that exist only in their kitchens. (A cursory Google search for a good chicken biryani recipe yielded ingredients like chicken stock \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my mom literally screamed when I suggested this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or curry paste  something that has never once been in her kitchen.) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started to do this too  refusing to give my boyfriend a complete ingredient list  even when I need help cooking  because I refuse to let him in on a secret I have been scratching at for years. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about making herself needed as a mother  or forcing me into coming home and beg for my favorite lotus root  a recipe specific to Kashmir that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never found at a restaurant. Regional differences are lost  the little things my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother did in the kitchen get muddied \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unless I ask. And I have been asking  for years  for as long as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been away from home and have been trying to find my mom at the bottom of a 20-quart pot. All of this reduces my cooking to a kind of trial and error. Once  when I tried to make her rogan josh  I ended up adding three times the right amount of cinnamon; my lamb tasted like an angry ginger snap. Two years after that  she casually mentioned that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only supposed to use flat cinnamon sticks  and not the rolled up ones  which apparently makes a fucking difference. When I last visited  she sent me back to my home with frozen rogan josh in my suitcase. Later  when I defrosted and ate it  I picked through it  pulling out any identifiable spices I could find. At the bottom of my bowl was a dark ball the texture of soft wood. I cleaned it off and texted it to my mom with my trademark calm: \u00e2\u0080\u009c?!?!?!?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She gave me the Hindi word for it  leaving me to creative googling to figure out what it was. (I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve invested too much to give it up that easy.) Mom swears that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not actively keeping ingredients from me  that she just forgets because cooking is so second-nature to her. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain why sometimes she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add an ingredient to her list for me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a year ago  the rogan josh recipe had coriander powder in it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 later saying something like  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would I ever tell you to put coriander powder in it? Nothing has coriander powder in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now she says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually garam masala  but not the kind you buy in the store (she says this with her particular brand of derision usually reserved for \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite\u00e2\u0080\u009d grocery stores) but the kind that she makes at home  fistfuls of unidentifiable brown spices hand-ground with a mortar and pestle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will give you some when you come home \u00e2\u0080\u009d she always says  but she is a liar  because she never actually has. Food has always been my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domain  so maybe it makes sense that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give me her trade secrets just yet.",

While roughly the same number of lawmakers in both parties are leaving their seats to run for higher office  just nine House Democrats are retiring outright or have already resigned  compared with 24 Republicans. (House members running for other offices often count as retirements  because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually impractical or illegal to run for multiple positions at the same time.) Including those members who are leaving to run for another office  there will be 17 open House seats vacated by Democrats and 35 for Republicans. Democratic victories last November in gubernatorial and state legislative races in Virginia and New Jersey could spur more retirements among Republicans worried about the national political environment under Trump.

She and others clearly saw what was an opportunity. Before the war  women's colleges had taught women math and science but they were reluctant to train very many women because they knew they couldn't get jobs. And so when the war started  they were still skeptical about putting too many women into math majors because they just worried that all of this was going to be yanked away after the war. But I also thought Virginia Gildersleeve was very crafty. She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

During Wright\u2019s interrogation  which was recounted at trial in testimony by a local police officer  he claimed that  Hoxha  reached out to him via Paltalk and asked him if he was interested in Islamic State. Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State\u2019s\u2019 mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype\u2019s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State\u2019s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that na\u00efve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that \u201cif you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won\u2019t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.\u201d",

School can also be a particular point of contention between teen influencers and their parents. Because of scheduling and travel demands  almost all young influencers are homeschooled  a fact that most parents I talked to accept begrudgingly. A few internet celebrities  such as Brent Rivera  are lucky enough to live near Los Angeles and can still attend high school while juggling work meetings.

Such top-down tactics might be enforced easily at live performances  as one of my research assistants observed firsthand at a Chris Rock show in Niagara Falls. However  as a daily ritual for high-school students  all-or-nothing digital abstinence enforced by an authority figure seems destined to backfire  possibly leading to rejection\u2014or even worse  a legal complaint. In an attempt to tackle this disciplinary problem  I have been offering workshops to schoolteachers that riff on and revise the design Yondr originated. In the workshops  I provide a kit that allows students to make their own digital abstinence case  but with an obnoxiously loud Velcro enclosure rather than a silent  magnetic clasp. This semipermeable design\u2014the Resistor Case  I call it\u2014is intended to promote self-regulation  not authoritarian control. The Velcro acts as a gateway to conscience: It provides just enough resistance and noise to make its owner think twice before opening it. Michael I. Norton  Daniel Mochon  and Dan Ariely coined the \u201cIKEA effect\u201d to name the increase in value people assign to self-made products. With the Resistor Case  I\u2019m counting on a similar effect  that students who fist construct and then choose to make use of their DIY phone lockers might be more compelled to use them. Of course  the kit will only work if the teacher provides a context for it that includes a discussion of responsible smartphone use.

Part of the problem is that what made Darling such an innovative character in the 1980s isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what makes her so compelling now. And I fully agree with you  Adrienne: The moments where we see Darling undergoing the most growth and becoming most self-aware are all related to women. In addition to Opal  and her therapist  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d add her boss  Raqueletta Moss to the mix. Serwer: To go off your points about Insecure  Gillian and Adrienne  one of Spike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues here is that the artists  he  helped influence are actually better at this now than  he  is. Which is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to happen! Even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something Spike would like to hear. White: I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly right. Serwer: I found myself most roped in when the show was lingering on Darling and her issues in the art world (the satire of which is funny and brutal)  and less so when it was focusing on the love triangle (rectangle?) the original film was centered on. Of her suitors  I found Mars Blackmon the most likable and relatable  in part because he feels like the underdog in a situation that involves a wealthy Wall Street type and a French-speaking model. Also  Anthony Ramos is really good at inhabiting the character. White: I was scared about how the character of Mars (originally played by  Lee ) would translate  but in the end he was one of the highlights of the show and unquestionably the male suitor who was best folded into the present day. Ramos did such a fantastic job of keeping Mars\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit of absurdity and geekiness while making him feel fresh and original. As for the other suitors  I found Greer and Jamie difficult to stomach\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not just because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be obnoxious. Both characters seem to be relics of the 1980s in dress  in attitude  and in their assumptions about their place in society  and Darling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.",

I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On a typical day   Truong  gets maybe a half dozen mentions on Twitter.

Some of his appetites  at least  had waned\u2026.With a pencil neck and a sagging jacket he clambered gamely onto the stage after Hillary\u2019s acceptance speech and played happily with the red balloons that fell from the ceiling. When the couple repeatedly reminded the crowd of their new status as grandparents it was to suggest very different associations in voters\u2019 minds. \u2026Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger  stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s.  Juanita Broaddrick  reported that when  she  was a volunteer on one of  his  gubernatorial campaigns   she  had arranged to meet  him  in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute   he  had changed the location to  her  room in the hotel  where  she  says  he  very violently raped  her .  She  said  she  fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left  her  bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel   he  caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones  and  Jones says   he  sent a couple of state troopers to invite  her  to  his  suite  where  he  exposed  his  penis to  her  and told  her  to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met  him  in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that  he  groped  her   rubbed  his  erect penis on  her   and pushed  her  hand to  his  crotch. It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today\u2019s accused men have experienced. Rather  he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation and it was willing\u2014eager\u2014to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.",

And then I take that energy and I give it to Jack. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an artist. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to have his heart soar. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his ship  man. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a dime. This is his ship  and his moment. He owns the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To survey (and enjoy) the power of the vast system he commands  the captain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great patriarch of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must stand on the bridge and look at Titanic itself. But Jack  because this is not his ship and not his dream  can stand at Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prow as it cuts through the water  feeling the sun on his face  and watching the dolphins that leap and swim \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the sheer joy and exultation of motion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He can fully experience Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power because he feels no need to convince himself he commands it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then he can give it to Rose. \"I've been part of a film that's broken cultural boundaries \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio reflected in 2004. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to the middle of Brazil  in the rainforest  and the Indians there knew [Titanic]. It's surreal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From the beginning  it was clear Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success transcended borders. When it finally left US theaters in the fall of 1998 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 staying on the big screen even after it was released on video \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it had made $659 million domestically. In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.)

Omata \u2019s analog appearance also disguises all the electronics that make  it  work. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell that  it \u2019s a computer on the inside \u201d Bleecker says. \u201cPeople think  it  needs to be tethered to the bike.\u201d Instead  a microcontroller  GPS sensor  barometer  and a set of motors make it work. After a ride   Omata  can be wired to a computer or wirelessly connected to a smartphone to download the same sort of data that its more obviously digital competitors make available: performance  distance  mapping  and so on. \u201cOur ambition isn\u2019t to get rid of the computation \u201d Bleecker explains  \u201cbut to hide it.\u201d * * * These days  people try to hide computers by escaping from them  like I escape to my lawn. The machines \u201chide\u201d inside offices or jacket pockets so their owners can accomplish other goals. In some cases  the drive to get away from computers degenerates into wistfulness. The word \u201canalog\u201d has come to indicate retro nostalgia first  a way of resisting or even abandoning bits in favor of atoms. Certainly  Omata risks such accusation. But the line separating analog and digital isn\u2019t as clean as popular usage makes it seem. Writing in The New York Times in 2015  Rob Walker observed an \u201canalog fever\u201d in contemporary culture. A counterrevolution to the digital revolution. Walker cites the rise of vinyl records and the decline of ebook sales in favor of print as evidence of this fever. It sounds right to modern ears. But strictly speaking  simply not being a computer doesn\u2019t make something analog. Analog devices represent information with a continuously variable portrayal of that information. They create an analogous depiction of a source signal in physical form. A mechanical watch  for example  measures the passage of time with a set of hands  driven by a loaded spring  that traverse the watch face. In the case of a bicycle  as Newman suggests  the crankcase moves the bike analogously to the rider\u2019s physical exertion. Today  almost everything is a hybrid. Even seemingly analog devices are also digital ones. By contrast  digital devices sample a stream of activity at regular intervals  converting those measures into discrete values for manipulation by an electronic device. Since computers are the machines that usually sense  store  and manipulate the resulting digital signals  \u201cdigital\u201d has come to refer to anything that makes use of computer technology. In turn  analog started meaning \u201cnot involving computers\u201d rather than continuously representing a signal with a physical quantity.",

The Express News reported the statute has only led to one conviction in Bexar County  where the truck was found  since it was signed into law in 2011.  McManus  said  his  decision to keep the investigation under the SAPD umbrella and pursue the state-level smuggling charge was \u00e2\u0080\u009csituational\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on a fairly fluid situation on the scene \u00e2\u0080\u009d not the result of a change in policy.",

Exactly like this. If you went back in a time machine and stood on the deck  this is what you would have seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Second Officer Lightoller would be over there \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and Wallace Hartley would be leading the band in a lively waltz just there  a few yards away \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [and] slaloming between these immovable pylons of historical fact are  Jack  and Rose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In this way   Cameron  wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe film comes full circle  from being a film about Titanic  to being a love story that happens merely to be set on Titanic  back to being about the emotional truth of Titanic after all. By feeling the fear  the loss  the heartbreak of  Jack  and Rose  we finally can feel for the 1 500.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After seeing Titanic for the first time  Harry Knowles compared the experience to traveling to the past through self-willed hypnosis  like the hero of Somewhere in Time. Titanic experts who visited Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set had the same experience in the flesh.  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion to history was exacting  and at times excruciating: Every possible detail  from the davits used to lower the lifeboats to the carpet in the first-class dining saloon (recreated  all 18 000 square feet of it  by the same company that had manufactured the original)  was identical to what Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passengers would have seen. When the furniture being artificially aged for a scene recreating the wreck didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look quite right to  Cameron    he  spent a day and a half working on the props himself. ( He  was supposed to be finishing the screenplay at the time.) \u00e2\u0080\u009c Cameron  wanted real wallpaper and things like that \" the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of physical production  Fred Gallo  recalled. \"I said  'Why don't you build the sets and have them paint on the wallpaper? No one will ever know.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d But  Cameron  would. Thousands of props  from ashtrays to teacups to forks  had to be stamped with the White Star Line emblem  even if it was impossible for viewers to see. The costumes alone cost $8.4 million. The chandeliers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be Lucite   Cameron  decided  because then they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chime ominously as the ship began to tilt; they would have to be crystal  just as they had been in 1912. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere should be a little brass sign right here that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098Push \u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  said apologetically to Ken Marschall  as he led the Titanic expert through a doorway on D deck during a set visit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was one delight after another \u00e2\u0080\u009d Marschall said of his time on Titanic.

This analysis has always been obviously wrong in at least one more way: Titanic is not a fun movie to watch. You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escaping from anything so much as putting yourself through an emotional ordeal: a decathlon of passion  dread  terror  numbness  and finally cathartic hope. You  yourself  have survived something by the end of Titanic; you have sat immersed in death  in dying  in questions about your own behavior in such a situation  and have asked yourself to believe in love in the face of all this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps have been able to. For that experience  we were willing to go back to Titanic over and over again. And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focusing on the girls in the audience  then please \u00e2\u0080\u0094 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really think about them. Who were these girls  and why were they there? Why was I? When Titanic was in theaters  girls of 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 shaped their lives around it  and fell in love not just with Leo  but with the whole story they had first found him in. We had a sense  maybe  that life as we knew it was not so different from Titanic: that we  too  lived in a world where society might have to fall apart completely before we could be liberated from the roles that gender and class and race forced us to occupy. In Titanic  Rose is freed not because her mother and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 die (they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t)  but because a microcosm of the world as she knows it collapses around her  and in that moment she realizes its rules no longer dictate her existence. They were never really real  of course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but now that she has seen the spectacular defeat of every system the society that raised her guaranteed would work forever  she can no longer even feel its laws governing her. Something breaks when you no longer believe that anyone  anywhere  can build an unsinkable ship. And if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put your faith in a system like a ship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or a government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you have to start directing all your trust  all your love  to the people around you. Titanic poses the question of what we can hold onto when the structures and beliefs we have built our lives on founder beneath us  and one of the answers it allows us to reach is: each other. We hold onto each other. Recently  a writer friend told me that this year  as the world has started to feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s falling apart  he has found himself turning again and again to W.H. Auden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing lines in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeptember 1  1939\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. In the past year  I have developed the same kind of relationship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have been taking the same kind of refuge  grasping for the same kind of wisdom \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with Titanic. When I first fell in love with Titanic  at 9 years old  I wanted to be Jack as much as I wanted to be loved by him. I wanted the freedom he enjoyed: freedom that seemed to give him the ability to love so deeply and so selflessly. It was the kind of freedom the world around me said a girl could never have. But the world had also told Rose that  and she had found that freedom  in the end. Yet no matter how vast James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities were  his imagination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 big enough to bring a lost ship back to life; big enough  even  to let the viewer feel some sense of what 1 500 lost souls really means \u00e2\u0080\u0094 still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conjure a vision so radical that it could let Jack survive. If it were possible for  James Cameron  to imagine masculinity doing anything  in the long term  but infecting everything around it with violence and arrogance and greed and destruction  then Jack could have survived. If  Cameron  were able to imagine a world beyond the hierarchy of patriarchal control \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead of just spectacularly destroying one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then Jack could have survived. If he could have imagined possibilities for men beyond either blindly following the patriarchy or dying for its sins  then Jack could have survived. But instead  Jack has to die  and to love Rose in the only way a world of patriarchal masculinity  even one reduced to flotsam  will allow: by giving his life for hers. Beyond even Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unresolved questions about masculinity  the one radical possibility  James Cameron  seems unable to imagine is one in which partners can lovingly empower each other through a life lived together. This is where we have no choice but to do what he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: to imagine such love  and live it. To focus on nurture  and let go of heroism. To know that love is the only way through. To say: Get on this board  you idiot. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room for us both.",

While it is often tempting to assume that individuals are \u201cradicalized online\u201d through their consumption of propaganda  this is rarely the case.

She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

Mom  doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about death; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too macabre for our pleasant chats. But I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help thinking about it  an anxiety that started to ramp up in my early twenties when I noticed how little I am capable of doing on my own. I still call  her  to consult on how to appropriately wash a lace bra  and  she  still buys me leggings if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on sale  and  she  gets this rare herb shipped in from India that I have no idea where else to get outside of  her  pantry. These gaps in my knowledge are terrifying enough  but what about all the things I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know? Sheer chai  for example  is the most disgusting product  her  home country has ever produced \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but will I one day wish I knew how to make it? When you emigrate  you end up the last person to touch a lot of your family history. Somewhere along the line  we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maiden name. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget what her actual name was before she changed it when she moved. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lose language and the way to make a candle from ghee and a cotton ball. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pull all of this information out of her  and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t carry all of it after she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone  and I panic when I think about how impossible it feels to one day not need her. But at least I can try to cook. My mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own mother died in India  seemingly suddenly  from a combination of declining health and crummy care.  Mom  was with  her  when it happened  but near the end my grandmother was confused and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to register that  her  daughter had flown all that way just to see her off. When I imagine my mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death  I picture her perched on her proverbial deathbed  lucid but weak  about to die. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll raise one arthritic finger toward me  motioning for me to come closer to her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes  mother \u00e2\u0080\u009d I will say  and kneel down so her face is close to mine  glistening with tears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCloser \u00e2\u0080\u009d she will say  and I will press forward  taking her hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I will ask. And with one final rasp  the death rattle of a long life winding down  my mom will wheeze out her final words  releasing me from a lifetime of trying to keep her as close to me as possible: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was just salt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0097\u008f",

If you truly wanted to equalize and integrate schools  you would have to. But you can go a step shorter than that. New York City public schools are majority black and Latino. But you can go to any of the suburbs around  and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very heavily white. So in New York and all across the North  you could simply move into an all-white community and go to all-white public schools. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how you avoided desegregation. In the South  most school districts were countywide. So you either paid for private school or you dealt with desegregation. In the North  you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that. The key difference between the North and the South is for the vast majority of the history of this country  90 percent of all black people lived in the South. The South responds with Jim Crow  by passing laws that restrict the movement of black people. The North doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do that. It has a very tiny black population. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only once black people start migrating out of the South in the 1900s that the North shows its true ugly racist head.

As  Chris Kennedy  campaigns for governor   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s talked about  his  business successes.  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointed to  his  management of the Merchandise Mart  \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the great economic engines of Illinois \u00e2\u0080\u009d and to  his  role developing skyscrapers on Wolf Point along the Chicago River.  Kennedy   however  has not highlighted one of  his  biggest projects to date \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a nearly half-billion dollar public-private partnership to build a convention center and Medical Mart in Cleveland. Local politicians  led by a longtime family friend  gave  Kennedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  company a no-bid contract and pushed through a controversial sales tax hike to pay for it. As the project got off the ground   Kennedy  told Cleveland residents the one-stop medical superstore would remake the Rust Belt city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisney World for doctors\u00e2\u0080\u009d and draw coveted medical conventions to town. Instead  the project was plagued by accusations of insider dealings  secrecy and failed promises.  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s company made millions of dollars  while residents are stuck paying more on items they purchase. Four years after the 235 000-square-foot Medical Mart opened its doors   Kennedy  and  his  company have long since departed amid criticism they did little to foster the original goals of the struggling project. Now rebranded the Global Center for Health Innovation  the building sits eerily empty most days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the glassy high-tech showrooms of its few tenants unstaffed and deserted. Subsequent management companies have failed to bring in revenue-producing tenants or the flood of health care trade shows once promised.  Kennedy  said  he  was only trying to help Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders achieve their goals of a new convention center and a revitalized downtown.  He  said  his  company took on a project when few were looking at the city  and the long-term business plan shifted after  he  left. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a secretive contract. It certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done without public scrutiny \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what generated more press coverage in Cleveland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonestly  did we pull a fast one? Did we slide one by?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Kennedy  added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any of that happened. I think everybody knew everything by the time we completed our deal. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuyahoga County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current executive  Armond Budish  told reporters last month that he could call the Medical Mart building \u00e2\u0080\u009can inherited albatross \u00e2\u0080\u009d but chooses to remain hopeful the development someday will succeed. Tim Hagan  a  Kennedy  family friend  spearheaded the push for the Medical Mart when he was a county commissioner a decade ago. Hagan said he stands by his decision to support  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s project but acknowledged the development has fallen short. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point of what we were trying to do is make the convention facility \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 more attractive for outside investments to come in for events \u00e2\u0080\u009d Hagan said over coffee in a recent interview in Cleveland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas it worked out \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 as much as we thought it was going to work out  immediately? No  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heywood Sanders is an urban planning and public policy scholar who is critical of convention centers as publicly funded economic development projects. He has studied the Medical Mart deal for years and said Cleveland was blinded by its own misplaced hopes and the  Kennedy  mystique. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDesperate cities do desperate things \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sanders  a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Sanders said no hard data existed showing that a Medical Mart would succeed or produce any economic benefits for Cleveland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense then  and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to make sense now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. (David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune) Once a bustling industrial metropolis  Cleveland experienced a hard slide into Rust Belt decline during the 1970s and \u00e2\u0080\u009980s. Its population and manufacturing base shrank as factories and mills closed down. One of the bright spots in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic landscape appeared to be health care. The Cleveland Clinic grew over the past 40 years to be one of the most renowned hospital complexes in the world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rivaling the Mayo Clinic as a destination for affluent patients around the globe seeking out the best  most innovative care. The clinic campus sits several miles east of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downtown lakefront  which continued to decline over the years. Since the late \u00e2\u0080\u009970s  some civic leaders held onto the belief that renovating the outdated underground convention center might be the key to making the city center a destination once again. The political and financial capital to make it happen never materialized. Investing public money in building convention facilities is often a divisive issue. Boosters often say if you build it  they will come; others say the investment rarely pays off. William Bowen  a professor of public administration at Cleveland State University  puts himself in the latter category. Convention center deals typically underperform their projections that spurred their construction  he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the time  the valuation of the impact of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built either doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen  or \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t  as a rule  pay back the public coffers \u00e2\u0080\u009d Bowen said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borne out by the majority of the research.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement started to change the sense of possibility  and then  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement would put it over the hump  Hagan said. The consensus version of how the development came about begins with Dr. Toby Cosgrove  Cleveland Clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime president. According to  Kennedy   Cosgrove wanted to leverage the clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cachet to revitalize downtown Cleveland. Cosgrove declined multiple interview requests.  Kennedy  said a New York real estate executive who was Cosgrove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient recommended Merchandise Mart and  Kennedy .  Kennedy  said Cosgrove called  him  to discuss the potential for a mart geared toward medical professionals.  Kennedy  said in 2005  he  and another Merchandise Mart official met with Cosgrove and local and state economic officials at the clinic.  Kennedy  said  he  suggested the new medical mart be tied into rebuilding Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aging convention center.",

To solve the environmental-noise problem  cities and their citizens should learn from the mistakes of the past. Targeting the noise of individuals is ineffective  antisocial  and fails to eradicate the noise that really hurts people: environmental noise. Solutions to that problem must be systemic  requiring a large-scale  collective response across many different targets. Despite her intentions  Julia Barnett Rice offers a model. She arrived at success only once she began addressing the marine industry at large. Similar approaches can work today. Instead of punishing individual transportation workers whose trucks may be too old  a more comprehensive solution could target the Department of Transportation  with demands to repave worn roads with the porous asphalt configurations used in Europe to reduce tire noise. Likewise  any move toward using renewable energy sources will result in a quieter environment  as coal and oil extraction are extremely noisy labors. At the local and state level  demanding funding for repairs and improvement to outdated transit infrastructure will greatly reduce the noise caused by trains  cars  and trucks. Urban-planning approaches to eliminating noise on a city-by-city basis can be as simple as taking a single lane away from cars and giving it to bicycles  people  or green space. Improving  expanding  and properly funding public transit removes cars from the road  both reducing the sound they produce and replacing it with quieter options like trams and high-speed light-rail. In architecture  acoustics should play a greater role in all structures  from mundane apartment buildings to the grandest art museums. Noise control should be a consideration from the very first planning stage  rather than tacked on as an afterthought.",

Rodchenkov ran the lab at Sochi during the Winter Olympics  and what he did there was essentially what he did for Fogel  but on a more massive scale: helping dozens of athletes dope all through the Games while testing negative on every single test. The story he told to the Times and to Fogel would strain the imagination  were it not independently confirmed by two investigations: one by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and one by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Here is the summary of the operation  from the Times: The director  Grigory Rodchenkov  who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians  said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes  helping to facilitate one of the most elaborate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and successful\u00e2\u0080\u0094doping ploys in sports history. It involved some of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest stars of the Games  including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won two golds. In a dark-of-night operation  Russian antidoping experts and members of the intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine collected months earlier  somehow breaking into the supposedly tamper-proof bottles that are the standard at international competitions  Dr. Rodchenkov said. For hours each night  they worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp  passing bottles of urine through a hand-size hole in the wall  to be ready for testing the next day  he said. By the end of the Games  Dr. Rodchenkov estimated  as many as 100 dirty urine samples were expunged. None of the athletes were caught doping. More important  Russia won the most medals of the Games  easily surpassing its main rival  the United States  and undermining the integrity of one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prestigious sporting events. All of this  Rodchenkov said  was overseen by an officer of the federal security services  the FSB  and had the approval of  Mutko  and Putin.",

It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis character doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through torment \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  later said of the role  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u00e2\u0080\u0099\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098A three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know now why you cry\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Better Worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic follows this example. Even if men aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actively oppressing women  Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.",

Rodchenkov ran the lab at Sochi during the Winter Olympics  and what he did there was essentially what he did for Fogel  but on a more massive scale: helping dozens of athletes dope all through the Games while testing negative on every single test. The story he told to the Times and to Fogel would strain the imagination  were it not independently confirmed by two investigations: one by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and one by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Here is the summary of the operation  from the Times: The director  Grigory Rodchenkov  who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians  said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes  helping to facilitate one of the most elaborate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and successful\u00e2\u0080\u0094doping ploys in sports history. It involved some of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest stars of the Games  including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won two golds. In a dark-of-night operation  Russian antidoping experts and members of the intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine collected months earlier  somehow breaking into the supposedly tamper-proof bottles that are the standard at international competitions  Dr. Rodchenkov said. For hours each night  they worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp  passing bottles of urine through a hand-size hole in the wall  to be ready for testing the next day  he said. By the end of the Games  Dr. Rodchenkov estimated  as many as 100 dirty urine samples were expunged. None of the athletes were caught doping. More important  Russia won the most medals of the Games  easily surpassing its main rival  the United States  and undermining the integrity of one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prestigious sporting events. All of this  Rodchenkov said  was overseen by an officer of the federal security services  the FSB  and had the approval of  Mutko  and Putin.",

White: For sure  but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue those aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even representative of Brooklyn in this moment. Brooklyn is not the Brooklyn of the \u00e2\u0080\u009980s or \u00e2\u0080\u009990s (so  Lee  keeps reminding us). Mock: On another note  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thankful that they got rid of the rape scene from the movie. I think the transition to dealing with sexual harassment and assault in the streets was the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest material  especially as it bled into Darling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art work  which helped solve some of her financial problems. The personal became political then became personal again. Serwer: I think part of the reason why that subplot is so strong is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on a work called Stop Telling Women to Smile by the artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh  who was also a consultant on the show. Fazlalizadeh put up a series of posters around Brooklyn with similar anti\u00e2\u0080\u0093street harassment messages she drew from women she interviewed about their experiences. Green: Spike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long talked about regretting that rape scene (and as recently as November). I agree  Brentin  that the show did a really good job of making sexual trauma an undercurrent without visually exploiting female characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the street-art campaign to Darling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art student replacing Lil\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Kim with herself on the Hard Core album cover for a school assignment. With the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree black female form\u00e2\u0080\u009d as its thematic throughline  the show subtly deals with sex and trauma  complicating the idea of autonomy and who has access to it.",

By the time my ancestor set sail on the Mayflower  Europeans had been visiting New England for more than a hundred years.

New England  the Europeans saw  was thickly settled and well defended. In 1605 and 1606 Samuel de Champlain visited Cape Cod  hoping to establish a French base.  He  abandoned the idea. Too many people already lived there. A year later Sir Ferdinando Gorges\u00e2\u0080\u0094British despite  his  name\u00e2\u0080\u0094tried to establish an English community in southern Maine. It had more founders than Plymouth and seems to have been better organized. Confronted by numerous well-armed local Indians  the settlers abandoned the project within months. The Indians at Plymouth would surely have been an equal obstacle to my ancestor and his ramshackle expedition had disease not intervened. Faced with such stories  historians have long wondered how many people lived in the Americas at the time of contact. \"Debated since Columbus attempted a partial census on Hispaniola in 1496 \" William Denevan has written  this \"remains one of the great inquiries of history.\" (In 1976 Denevan assembled and edited an entire book on the subject  The Native Population of the Americas in 1492.) The first scholarly estimate of the indigenous population was made in 1910 by James Mooney  a distinguished ethnographer at the Smithsonian Institution. Combing through old documents  he concluded that in 1491 North America had 1.15 million inhabitants. Mooney's glittering reputation ensured that most subsequent researchers accepted his figure uncritically.",

Kesha\u2019s alleged abuse by her mentor and producer Dr. Luke was addressed and transcended on this year\u2019s Rainbow.

Zhang: As you know  Novartis disputes the $200 million figure because not all of that money went directly to CAR-T for cancer or toward the specific therapy behind Kymriah.  Mitchell : We're going to send you a clip from a blog post by Francis Collins  the head of the National Institutes of Health  in which  he  explains the long history of NIH in building the foundational science for CAR-T. Here's our position: From 1993 until 2017  NIH invested more than $200 million in the overall science of CAR-T. Even the seminal paper that was published in August of 2011 by Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania was funded in part by the NIH. All of the makers\u2014Novartis  Kite (which will become Gilead)  and Juno [other companies pursuing CAR-T cell therapy]\u2014are standing on that foundational science. The taxpayers invested early when the risk was the greatest. Zhang: What do you think is a fair price for Kymriah? Mitchell: Well  we have run the numbers a variety of different ways. Now  the point is no one knows the real numbers except Novartis  so we go back to the statements in a Reuters article in 2015 where Kite\u2019s chief financial officer said they thought the base price was $150 000 for treatment  and analysts at that time were saying [costs could be] up to $300 000. When we tried to model  we can\u2019t get over $300 000. Zhang: Novartis did take two unusual steps when announcing the price of Kymriah. First  they pointed to a British analysis to say they actually thought Kymriah was worth $600 000 to $750 000 but they were going to price it lower at $475 000. And second  they said patients who don\u2019t respond after 30 days to the treatment will not have to pay.",

Here are some of the highlights of the president\u00e2s unique brand of diplomacy\u00e2and its aftershocks. Tweet Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! \u00e2  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  February 2  2017 Background The \u00e2dumb deal\u00e2 the president referred to was an Obama-era agreement on refugees. The U.S. had agreed with Australia to let in 1 250 refugees who  under a controversial Australian policy  were housed in camps in the Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea and Nauru; Australia  in turn  would resettle refugees from El Salvador  Guatemala  and Honduras. By the time he sent the tweet on February 2   Trump  had signed an executive order that banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. (That order was blocked by courts  though the Supreme Court has allowed another version of it to proceed while litigation is ongoing.)  He  had also conducted what\u00e2s now an infamous phone call with Malcolm Turnbull  the Australian prime minister  in which  he  accused Turnbull of trying to export the \u00e2next Boston bombers\u00e2 and hung up. The call and the tweet were unusually hostile for an ally that\u00e2s fought alongside American troops in nearly every conflict since World War II. Upshot Despite initial speculation  Trump  would back out of the deal  the first refugees from the deal were resettled in the U.S. in September. U.S.-Australia relations are holding steady.",

It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis character doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through torment \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  later said of the role  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u00e2\u0080\u0099\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098A three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know now why you cry\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Better Worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic follows this example. Even if men aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actively oppressing women  Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.",
