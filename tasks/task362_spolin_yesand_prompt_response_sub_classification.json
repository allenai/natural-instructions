    "Definition": "Given a prompt and two responses, identify which response is the type of \"yes, and\". Indicate your answer by 'Response 1' if the first response is correct, otherwise 'Response 2'. \"Yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accepts what another participant has stated (\"Yes\") and then expands on that line of thought or context (\"and...\"). 1 In short, a \"Yes, and\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \"Yes, and\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange.",
