        "\"Yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\"Yes\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\"and...\"). Given a prompt and two responses, identify which response is the type of \"yes, and\". Indicate your answer by 'Response 1' if the first response is correct, otherwise 'Response 2'.  Note that a \"Yes, and\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange."
