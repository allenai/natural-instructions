        "You need to create a question containing a blank (_), based on the given context word. Your question must contain two persons --PersonX and PersonY. The expected answer to your question must be PersonX. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. There should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style, pattern, or phrases in each question, try to increase diversity by varying sentence structure, blank placement, etc. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that Person X and Person Y have the same gender. In your question, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY."
