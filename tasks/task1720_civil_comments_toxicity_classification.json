They miss their responsibility for creating the conditions that make for a rich soup of angry people who don't see any way out.  Of course we all know that the Iraqi war was the worst response, particular how the first six months were handled. Bush's team was arrogant. Blackwater was arrogant.  Debathification was stupid, and arrogant.  They left stock piles of bombs around Bagdad that slowly dissolved to become IEDs. And throughout this the words of support for Islam were undermined by the radical right.  And it's gotten worse, much worse as Fox and team rally their troops to undermine considered actions that could both reduce the hatred and tension and increase our ability to deal with extremists on both ends...great insights!",

Is that okay with you, John? I am on your side!\n\nDo you have a problem with what I am doing? If  successful the state can get 12.5% royalty for the PFD and the CBR and much more! Think about it that is 125 Million Barrels of oil at no cost to you or the state! Add it up at $ 50.00 per Barrel for 125 million Barrels of oil for free! No one bid on these leases in the sale I got in so they would be wasting away otherwise! \n\nAlaska's Agencies and Law price Alaskans out of the oil business. Not one Alaska has ever drilled and found oil and sold it at a profit! The Voters of Alaska get the PFD and don't invest in drilling then Alaskans let the Legislature and the Governor do what the big three want. I am on your side I want Alaska open for business for Alaskans & other Citizens of the United States!",

Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.\n2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.\n3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).

A balanced, all parties contribute approach is the only possible short term as well as long term solution to the fiscal problems facing the state. Too bad the vast increase in oil production under SB21 didn't materialize as promised but that's the way \"crap shoots\"(as Kevin Meyer infamously declared SB21 to be) work out at least 50% of the time.
