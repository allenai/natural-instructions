PFD reform is not a good stand alone answer. The public will not abide a PFD raid; perceived or real!\n\nTo make matters worse, the Governor applauds the enemy when he needs to go right back for support to his strongest constituency, the general public and demand a better fiscal plan.\n\nThis constitutes a sad political strategy to shift the blame from the GOP, to the governor.\n\nPaybacks are a bitch",

Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.\n2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.\n3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).
