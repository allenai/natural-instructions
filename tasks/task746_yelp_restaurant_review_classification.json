            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store.

They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. The woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. Fortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.",

It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.The only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it under-the-table. Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I refused the technician's offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!",

At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.The real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background!

Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. After unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. Shortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. Long story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.I did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue.

We ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected.

But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.Anyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",

Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.

We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! I brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.",

I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didnt help at all so I dont know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didnt like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they dont care about their customers.

We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. For the entrée, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon.

They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'I ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas!

My room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisors bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. I love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, 'shoot pool' time.)

Also, the Rialto is lovely, and the bread pudding is heaven (generous portion, good to share).The service is generally phenomenal. The waitresses are really sweet and easy going, which makes the experience that much better. I've only experienced poor service here once.

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.For about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. So I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.AND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night.

The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston.

They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.For dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.

The only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) Boston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area.

I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  I pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. Instead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.Conclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.Point #2 - Prices are insane??Once upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!Now buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  I am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.Kudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  Now I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  This was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.The showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.SummaryDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.

The waiter was very knowledgeable about the fish selection as well as the wine.  They even gave us pistachio ice cream, baklava, and homemade donuts as a birthday dessert.",

I think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.I tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.I had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.But the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.This was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.I literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.On a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. This place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!",

            "input": "Channing is a photo ninja.My parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted.  The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.That wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.And the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.Seeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.Finally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.So yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.",

Regarding reliability and customer service, this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with.    Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   The last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldnt find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   Since she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. The WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  First cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  The second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me 'nothing was rescheduled'...they dont know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.The 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS:  the situation is a lil risky for me.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   **The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro was late!  I told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   **They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was proceeding to cancel this call.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  Needless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  The concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   Bottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.",

I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. I came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.I saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, 'thats what supply and demand is.' And walked away.I would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.Your 'lesson' in supply and demand was taken to heart. And Im sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. I know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.Sincerely,Former Kreuger farms fan",

Being that this is always my order, I've come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate (unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn't taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here!

Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice!

The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!

This comment is about the front-desk staff.I was very excited about their Groupon deal. So I called to schedule an appointment, telling them that I was using the Groupon. It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later, and her attitude was not so pleasant. Then, she said she would email me a registration package soon. But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment. So I completed it and sent it back immediately. Later, she did not remind me about the appointment again. I had a very bad day before the appointment, so unfortunately I forgot about it.When I called to reschedule, I apologized several times, and her attitude was still not so pleasant. She said, 'You cannot reschedule until you pay us the $50 cancellation fee. It says that on the website. I dont know where, but you can go find it.' You dont know where?! Because you never told me/possibly anyone about it?! $50 was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for!So I said, 'When there is a cancellation policy, my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment.' She said, 'Well, we do it two days before.' No, she did not do that either. So I found another dentist. They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called. Then, they called me to remind me two days before the appointment and two hours before the appointment.  Maybe being more responsible and courteous like the other dentists staff would not have turned away your customer.",

Also liked they had some rolls out of the ordinary rather than the typical combos that you find at many places.A few notes having read some other reviews....One review talks about the fish being frozen, he must not know much about sushi fish as all sushi fish is frozen as a way to kill any parasites the fish might have.  Size,  the place is small.  There are only 7 seats at the sushi bar and one table.  On a Thruseday evening at 7:30 not a problem.   Additional options is you can order sushi at Roscoes bar next door.  Roscoes provides the liquor service for the Miyamoto sushi.  So if the place is full simply sit next door.Definitely worth checking out.",

I had a pink lemonade, rootbeer float, and a blueberry pie.  ALL TERRIBLE TASTING!   I don't even want the other 3 I purchased so they are going in the trash.

Another 20 minutes pass and no one shows up. I call the dealership and the receptionist was very kind and apologized many times and someone was out within 5min. I told the salesman I wasnt looking to buy today and that I wanted to look at my options. We took the car I wanted for a test drive and I absolutely loved it. The car felt planted, even on wet surfaces. The route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and speeds to get a feel of the car. We went inside and took down my information. He asked if I wanted to buy the car today. I repeated myself and told him I was only looking for today. He started getting aggressive and intimidating about making the sales. He kept disappapearing every couple minutes, even while we were talking.

We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. Im not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasnt right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didnt want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.Anyways--we get our food and its not horrible. I had the jalapeño burger, which came with fried jalapeños. The burger had only a couple of jalapeños, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.Whatever--this place just didnt do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant.",

Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldnt. Glad I tried it though. I went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a 'must go' if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)They did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didnt really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you dont care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.Oh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you dont care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!",

I went here with a Groupon and wanted to give this place a try, third place trying Cuban food outside of Miami, I hoped this place wouldn't disappoint me like the others. I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population.",

I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasnt paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldnt help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, 'too late.' I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. Its awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their 'personalized sandwiches' and you get the complete opposite.And they dont close the sandwich when theyre done with it, instead, they just wrap it up.

The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short. I am normally very good at picking out flavors and appreciating unusual combinations, but there is a sweetness to many of the savory dishes that I can't place and just doesn't seem to belong. Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.With that said, the views and ambiance really are fantastic!

I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I cant recall his name but hes the only guy answering phones and giving 'advice', told me when I break in the new pads/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what youre suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldnt figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  Thats it, rant done.",

Customer service at that time was severely lacking and almost all employees seemed rude/agitated. Maybe you could blame that one on the severe humidity in the place - it's almost unbearable.We wandered in there yesterday, the whole time my bf muttering under his breath about how he didn't want to be there, didn't want to deal with anyone's shitty attitude, and thought the place was overpriced.....I just wanted to test the water in our tank, add some new fish, maybe a frog and some cool plants. Enter Colby...... the MOST helpful, patient fish person EVER!! He tested the water, gave us suggestions to up the pH level and spent the next hour with us. He helped us pick out fish, lights, plants..... He was Awesome.I'm so glad we decided to give them another shot. As long as Colby is there, we will continue to go back.",

I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. I really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age. I can't wait to go back. An awesome bubble tea gem!",

I also like to support small local stores as well but one of the nice things about this place is you can browse among a lot of different brands and not feel pressured about commissions. They'll make you samples. I also like to buy products here versus some other places because you get loyalty points for doing so.",

I shook it off and tried not to think of it. They only had two choices on their soda vending machine(ok, they are a small business) but I figured not to complain because I understand it's a small place. I paid and left. When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!!

The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non-customer for about 4 minutes, never acknowledging I was standing in front of him.  Two more people lined up behind me.  I asked if I could place an order.  The 'front man' moves to the back and the other guy comes and says 'Sure.  Sorry, were really busy.'  I order cheeseburger fries.  The former 'front man' puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave/convection oven for about 40 seconds.  He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone, shakes them up with dill flavored salt, covers them with cheese product sauce, 3 small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard.  He hands me the room temperature, hard and (previously) overcooked potatoes.  I was conflicted about what to do with the fries.  They were totally unappealing and tasteless, yet I paid $6 for them!

When we got seated, the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers. We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty. The rest were literally the smallest mussels I've ever eaten. Then it took 45 minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager.

She actually said that. Im no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadnt been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. When I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.Then, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they dont just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. When I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. So now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frogs '200% Peace of Mind Promise,' if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *'only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.' In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didnt exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.",

The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,.

However, have been here twice now and ordered their dosas on both occasions. The dosa was gr8, crispy with 2 kinds of chutney and a spicy sambhar. The potato mash stuffing inside the dosa was so spicy the first time around that my toddler was red in the face. The owner was generous enough to offer complimentary Gulab Jamun to calm the heat :) The jamuns were perfectly soft centered making them melt in the mouth. My husband had a to go order of Biryani on both counts, the quantity is for 2 servings but its still over priced. We tried the chicken chettinadu with nan. The Chettinadu was awesome with nicely balanced flavours, no over powering spices. The service can be be slow on weekends and be prepared to wait 45mins before your order arrives.Over all...gr8ly satisfied.",

Were pretty picky about our food - particularly coffees, teas, and desserts - but Octane never disappoints.  (Neither, for the record, does Cakes & Ale.)Pros:-The baked goods from Little Tart Bakeshop are truly divine.  The meringues, chocolate/caramel tarts, and basque tarts are particular favorites.  You can tell that all of the ingredients are high-quality, the recipes are tried-and-true, and the bakers are highly skilled.-Im a tea drinker, and I am thrilled that Octane offers loose-leaf Rishi Tea.  Yay!-Im not a coffee drinker, but my parents are, and they both very much enjoy the coffee at Octane.  They are extremely picky when it comes to coffee, so this is definitely a compliment. -In contrast to other reviewers, Ive found the waitstaff to be perfectly pleasant and polite every time Ive been there.  The male cashier with the gage earrings and the tattoos is particularly friendly and helpful.  Of course, I have only been here a handful of times, so who knows?-Its a neat loft space with high ceilings, plenty of light, and a rustic retro feel.-Although the patrons (and servers) largely appear to be 'hipsters,' unlike other reviewers, I have never personally had an issue with any of them being judgey, impolite, or at all unpleasant during my visits to Octane.  That said, Ive only been here a few times myself.Cons:-The chairs (as other reviewers have mentioned) are small, hard, and singularly uncomfortable.  -Most of the tables wobble.-In the summertime, the shop is virtually un-airconditioned, with two tiny ceiling fans providing next-to-no air circulation.  This makes it particularly difficult to enjoy a hot tea, which is my preferred beverage, when Im already sweltering.  I can only imagine how overheated the servers, cooks, and bakers must be hanging out over ovens and stoves in the back.  However, the temperature is fine during other seasons of the year.Overall, I would highly recommend Octane + the Little Tart Bakeshop  However, you may want to wait it out until slightly cooler months of the year to enjoy their delectable desserts and delicious drinks.  Although Ive never had them myself, my family has told me that their sandwiches and quiches are also wonderful.  If possible, it would be great if the chairs, tables, and AC could be fixed, but otherwise this place is truly excellent, and the food & drinks are perfect.  Yum!",

Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased. I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection. My friend's license is expired so he could not do the official report for me. My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find, one of them requiring major electrical repair. At my friend's urging, I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than $800 worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed. Because API did not document the electrical problems, the seller refused to reimburse that cost. In addition, the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it, he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator, that is not inluded in the inspection. I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work. So, the $400 I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money. When I asked Gary if he could at least refund me the cost of the inspection to help offset the many costs I incurred because of his company's neglect to find them, he ignored my request. Do not deal with these guys. I do not know how they have such high ratings in yelp but they are not a company to trust with such a large purchase.",

Being told you have to wait or there isn't a table when you walk up during dinner or brunch rush is not the restaurant's fault, it is yours.  We decided on a whim to come here, but called ahead and made a reservation for later that evening.  Yes, we had to wait 2 hours for that reservation, but because we called we were able to go shopping and do other things rather than sit and stare sourly at the host.Also, I found the staff to be superbly pleasant and obviously dedicated to their work.  I watched the entire staff while there, as I had a view of the entire room, and it was like a dance.  They all help each other and watch out for each other and give a head's up or quick word to the table's waiter if it wasn't their table.  The manager walked the room three times while I was there and spoke to each guest at least once to ensure a pleasurable experience.  This was a level of service and cooperation rarely seen outside the five-star scene.If you find attitude here, you brought it yourself, love.The food is carefully crafted to bring out specific flavors and combinations that the chef has designed.  This is not Applebees.  This is carefully crafted food, and it may not all be to your taste.  But that is the theme and design of this restaurant.  Frankly, I f***ing love it.  No, not everything on the menu, but the concept.  I spoke with the staff throughout the meal, and they take care to buy local when possible and also sustainably raised/harvest food when possible.  I like that in a restaurant, as that is how I eat at home.The drinks were also crafted with as much care as the food.  And while pricey, it was worth every penny.  Don't come here on a budget, but it's not overly expensive either.  The value matches the pricing perfectly.",

If you are history minded, you can go and seek out the graves of some of the cemeterys more famous 'inhabitants' such as Isabella Stewart Gardner, William Gray, Winslow Homer, or Mary Baker Eddy. The cemetery also offers guides describing the different trees, birds, wildlife, and plants you can encounter during your explorations of the grounds.In the summer, nothing is more peaceful or tranquil than grabbing a book, my camera, a bottle of water, maybe a friend, and sitting next to one of the ponds, feeling the sun on my skin and listening to the frogs serenade each other.I feel like Mt.

I lucked out and got pretty good roommates - this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex. Its luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor. A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog, he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room. The replacement roommate didnt clean to the point where his room shouldve been declared a bio-hazard. Like seriously, the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week. The main issue is if these people arent your roommates, it means theyre your neighbors. Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves, let alone another living creature, but for some reason have all adopted puppies theyre too immature to actually take care of. Theres constantly dog feces everywhere, even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment. Sometimes, they just leave the dog outside, completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that theyre required to be on a leash. Im amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars. Theres constantly garbage everywhere - theres was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for 5 days. Theres a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into - at one point they were up to 3 pizza boxes, a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree. The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it, but its like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest. Because the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere, there are constantly roach problems. No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control (which frequently gets ignored) you will still have roaches. Forever. They advertise 'gigabyte internet' in every room, but it cuts out almost every week, so good luck with that. A significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students, the office is pretty much run by idiot college students. The few that actually try to do their job and arent completely incompetent dont seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you. My friend once had an issue with a staff member being incredibly rude to her so she tried to complain to someone - they told her to speak to the woman she needed to complain about.

            "input": "We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. Some of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise thats all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.The ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue 'New England fishing scheme' decor.But we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didnt love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks/conversation/etc. exclusively to him (Im female). And it didnt seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: were here for the food. So....I love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if youre lucky). Ill certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.The bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasnt fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, Ive had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isnt a good sign that they know what theyre doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and its wasteful on the food costs. (We didnt really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)I love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more 'lobster pot pie' than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.As for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. With the bisque being 'good,' the salmon chowder being 'meh,' the newberg being 'downright awful,' and the roll being 'meh,' nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there/return/be romantic/eat more/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere. (Psssst -- just go to Le Pigeon. Right now.)",

When I went in the front desk staff were very friendly and the waiting room looked clean. I was called back a few minutes later by the waxer (I forget her name) I think Kelsey. Once we went into the room I got undressed and she started wiping. I thought she was going to go through the process with me as I told her this was my first wax. She abruptly stopped, explained to me she had other clients booked after me and then said rudely what are your questions. After asking she did the first strip of wax which hurt more than anything in life I have experienced! I said can you give me a minute before the next one? She stated again that she did not have time to give me a break because she had other clients. After the second strip I screamed and said I did not want to continue this it was far too painful. She said I've been doing this for over 10years, my response was I'm sure you have but this is not for me. She told me I could get dressed and as I pointed out the wax that was still left on my vagina and my skin was BLEEDING! She gave me a tissue and walked out of the room. I got dressed after placing tissue on my areas of skin that were still bleeding and left. Waxing is not for me I found it to be way too painful however this waxer was extremely unprofessional. She was blonde. She looked like she had been on an all night prior party bender with her makeup from the previous night still on. She had on scrubs that were completely wrinkled. Inside the exam room the floor was filthy, I know it is winter but clients are getting undressed the floor should be clean. Again had the experience been nice I could still say this wasn't for me but I'd refer a friend here, hell no. It was dirty, the waxer was dirty looking and her attitude was stank! Also there was NO one in the waiting room as I left!",

The menu is a bit limiting but the options they offer are all delectable. I chose the gnocchi with short ribs in a red wine sauce. Oh yeah.... Mouth watering. My husband had the bolognese and although he prefers a wider noodle the combination of beef, veal and pork were a perfect blend. Now I would have rated this a five star but they charge for bread. My thought is if you serve meals with tangy sauces that should be savored by a swirl around the plate with some bread don't charge for it. Just a point that I thought should be notated.

We chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing,  also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my  personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain,  and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious.

They were out already (of course), but gave me a 'Firearms Request Form' and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock.  A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks.Two weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabelas.  So I start a series of polite calls to the store.  And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with 'Jay', who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00.  After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s).  Needless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call.  Apparently once I left the store with that 'Firearms Request Form', my request was promptly tossed in the Cabelas trash can.  Or so I surmise, because Cabelas REALLY didnt seem to want my $370.  Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess.  So I took my business to one of Cabelas local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didnt have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabelas.I do hope someone at Cabelas sees this review, and finds out why a customer cant receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all.  Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back.  Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabelas, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service.  Going forward I think Ill take a pass on Cabelas.  And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabelas you may or may not get it.  Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.",

That sandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's got a chipotle mayo that is just incredible. It's been about 3 years since I've been here but I still crave that meatloaf sandwich all of the time. I did have the Mac and cheese at one point and from what I remember, that was great too. I'm really into Mac and cheese so I almost always try them at restaurants but usually am disappointed because I can make better, which was not the case here.

We waited in line (in the rain) for 1.5-2 hours for each haunted house, and each house takes about 3-4 minutes to walk through (not the greatest wait-time to ride-time ratio) . Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.Universal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN. Even on a stormy night, the lines were ridiculously long, and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times.Unless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass, I wouldn't recommend attending. Don't waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub-par haunted houses.",

Just don't really eat pancakes and all that stuff, and they do a nice job with two eggs, but it's not exactly something I would get crazy enough to write a review about.Then I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....They had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. Then, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. When I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. Unlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont. I'll definitely be back at this excellent neighborhood cafe.",

Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated?  His 'great' service does not make ours any less authentic or real.   The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise. Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful. No, its not their fault its everyone elses. Yeah right!   Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect, courtesy, and kindness. I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance!  Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly!!  Point, Blank, and Period.  If Costellos do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff.  That is what good business people do!! I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day?  Are you fkn kidding me?  When you are in the 'hospitality' business you be hospitable regardless of what you have to deal with and what kind of day you are having.  Unbelievable!!   If you want to be treated well by staff and have GREAT food and quality service  and drinks then I strongly suggest you walk ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GALWAY HOUSE!   They also make an excellent dirty martini!  Bartenders and staff are super friendly.  Now on to the original review:I havent been to this place in years.  So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band. I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender.  I am talking MAJOR attitude.  If you dont like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work.  Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me.  I wont ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side.  The male bartender was much more friendlier!   If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when shes working.  Very disrespectful.  You dont disrespect and give attitude to the f**&n customers and expect tips!! I ended up leaving there and going to Cocos Lounge. The hospitality shown at CoCos lounge by the owner was exceptional.  Very friendly.  The waitresses had a smile, spoke to you with respect, and the service was fast!  The patrons were nice and the latin music was good.  Much better experience  I must say.  When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude! Period!!If anyone knows the owner/s of Costellos PLEASE let Me know via email.  I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isnt a relation.  They need better staff.  Hell Ill work there and give the patrons service with a f**^n smile!!!",

We had 24' sections that the salesperson filled with 21' cabinets and a 3' spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that dont look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.Second, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. You are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.And I agree with other reviews.  The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options.  Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option.  We are happy with our kitchen, but it was painful.",

He explained to us people were not leaving etc.....he finally got us a couch to sit at while we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for a table of 4. The service was so so poor.  Finally the host told us how sorry he was and he would give us complimentary dessert.  We felt better that as least they understood we had waited forever.  We sat and our server again apologized to us about how long we had to wait and reminded us about our free dessert more than once.  The food was sub-par to say the least.  The restaurant was SUPER loud because of the wedding going on next door and the bridal party kept running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks at the bar.  After we finished dinner we decided we would just order 2 desserts to spit between both couples.  When we ordered the two $6.00 desserts the waitress proceeded to tell us that we would only be getting one dessert free!  Needless to say, horrible customer service and not very bright wait staff, the least she could have done was go ask if they could comp our $12.00 worth of dessert that they had reminded is 4 time that we would be getting.

Is that even possible? You order at the counter, take a number and wait as patiently as you can for the deliciousness to be brought to you. The staff is friendly, helpful, and our food came quickly. The atmosphere seemed inviting and warm, even with board games!, so I wish that we had been able to stay. This is a perfect restaurant to stay awhile and chat or to get in and out if you are in a time crunch. And as for the food, I don't think you can wrong with whatever you choose. I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs. The entrees are served with three (small) sides and a (small) salad. We went with yellow rice, yucca fries and toasted plantains which were all excellent choices and I'm glad that we divvied them up so the three of us could all try. Loved the sauces that were served alongside, they were versatile enough to go with just about anything...so tasty! Wish I could have tried the empanadas and chicken, they both looked and smelled fantastic.I'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to try the flan or Cuban-style espresso...so don't short yourself out...make sure to indulge in one of the delicious-looking desserts.

It's much more convenient for me than trekking to Chinatown or Dorchester for pho, and there are so many tables, I've never had to wait in line.Their portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. Their bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. Their pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them.The shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in.I generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks. (On a side note, after visiting Vietnam and having pho there, I actually enjoy the pho here better for the flavor and generous toppings.) Don't expect it to be mindblowing.

This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager.

After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.

Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  Thats right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didnt offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.When our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, 'oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  Im looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.'   I said, 'well, thats unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?'  She said, 'Ill see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?'  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?We ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.We ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but were not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato soufflé (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. When the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, 'everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, 'No.  Can you tell me whats on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?' Her response was, 'Its a sweet potato soufflé, I can get you whipped cream.'  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didnt ask if she could get me anything else and didnt ask if we would like anything else to drink.The food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.  Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience.  I for one would rather drive downtown for better food, great service and an experience Im willing to tell my friends about. This unfortunately, will not be a place I would recommend.",

I knew it was in rough shape and had an idea what might be wrong, but Justin looked it over thoroughly then and there was really honest about how much work/money was needed to make it safe and rideable again - key for me as I'm 4 1/2 months pregnant and bike commute to my downtown job.  When I got another bike, I brought it there right away for a tuneup and again, they did a fantastic job.  A few weeks later, I started having trouble with it - gears wouldn't change, chain seemed to be skipping, tension on the chain was getting much higher - and when it finally seized on me right in the middle of the Main/Union intersection at 7.30am, I wheeled it back to the store and knocked the door.  Bob was there early and with no hesitation, let me in and had it up on the stand right away.  He called me before 10am with the prognosis and I was able to pick up my bike and cycle home that night.  Not only did he replace the faulty part with a part that will likely last the lifetime of the bike, but he also looked the bike over for free, even checking a wheel that he replaced for me the previous time.

We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy.

I explained to them that my arrival 45 minutes prior to the show was no accident, and I invited them to vacate my immediate surroundings, post-haste.  My fellow concertgoers cheered, and the lovely ladies departed, wide-eyed that someone could possibly have resisted their incredible charm, wit, and boobs.Go in cool weather, get there early, and go with a friend so that your seats can be defended while one of you runs up to one of the FULL BARS with DECENTLY PRICED drinks spread throughout the venue.",

Our waitress who I found out later is the manager, says it's on the board at the bar. So we go up and try to right down our selections and they don't know where markers are. We go back to sit down and they were seating another family at our table! For the inconvenience our waitress aka manager says to get a 6 pick flight instead of 4 and she will charge us for 4 pick. This is when she says she can do that cause she's the manager. Umm okay thanks for saving me $2! We should have left I know!!! My salmon tacos were salmon mush tacos. Not a single chunk of salmon!!! My boyfriends prawns were just okay. He said the fries were gross.  We definitely went to the wrong place! I left and got a cheese pizza and beer and went home!",

I needed a black sweater for work and I live right down the street from this location so i made a quick trip there to get one. I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly. I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on. No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms. Once I am ready to check out, I go to registers up front. No one was up there either so I wait. A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me, just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up. I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase. She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her. She looked at it and then says 'ill be right back'. I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up. She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get. I pick about 10 up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me. After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion. She said, 'I think we have the space blue'. (After I had looked at all of them!!!) I give up on the nail polish and say never mind. No apology or anything from her. She just continues to ring up my sweater and after that whole ordeal and her rude attitude, I decide that there is no way in hell I am about to pay $70 for a generic black sweater I could get anywhere else. I told her I no longer wanted it and I walked out. I was willing to pay the price for convince just because I wanted it immediately, but she completely pissed me off and ruined my experience. I wont be going back any time soon.",

This isnt really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you cant really have groups come eat here, Id consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain 'bros before hoes' to your wife before you ditch the bitch?Once you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. The shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and youre left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. If you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.The fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if youre feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If youre on a budget go to P. TERRYs for the same quality but much cheaper.",

I hate leaving a review like this, but Id rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, Im German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we werent even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didnt have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. I asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didnt even know what cafe con leche was??? We both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally 'drizzled' a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didnt have much of a taste to it either. There is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they dont have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! We both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!They have it decorated nicely and its very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly. I dont like giving reviews like this, but...thats what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did.",

Beyond that, I occasionally do unheard of, taboo things like accessorize and wear shoes that dont have thick rubber soles or steel shanks. However, the majority of my available funds after the monthly necessities like rent, food, booze, and hair dye are spent in the pursuit of mountain summits. Sometimes that means money for summit beers or seeking that elusive small town post-climb vegan meal. This creates quite a conundrum for your humble reviewer. The infrequent desire to appear what some might call 'attractive' (or 'showered' or 'not in tattered jeans'), but very little money with which to accomplish such lofty goals. Enter: Ether. I only noticed this place when someone pointed it out to me on a bike ride. I was instantly in love since their front-of-store display included my three guiltiest pleasures in the world: scarves, hats, and tall boots. My initial (and only, thus far) visit revealed a whole new time and money-sink for me. Scarves, large earrings, an impressive array of boots (most of which I l love, all of which are non-leather), a small but cute selection of clothing, large wooden bangles.. pretty much everything I love to wear condensed into one modest store (minus the overly shiny rings and pendants), and priced so that even your average gear-hording mountaineer can afford to retire her current pair of boots with the half-detached left sole. To top it off, the store is staffed by some of the most helpful, cheerful, but unobtrusive and non-pushy employees ever. As others have said, the quality isnt top-notch, but since my episodes of masquerading as an actual female are few and far between - its good enough for me!",

When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  Pros:The food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).Cons:The draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  The interior/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!",

Even though they mow it infrequently, Im always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   While they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didnt see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  Oh crap, this wont turn out well. Nervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.The owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and Ive met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.The next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.Thats how things are supposed to work.  Thats called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though its a little thing, its the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people. And because its become such a rare thing today, I wanted to point it out and say 'Thank You'.    Finally, weve gotten some rain and my grass is growing again.  In fact, I just noticed its looking a little shaggy.  And thanks to David and the guys at April Realty, I know exactly who to call.",

I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!The service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.I would most definitely recommend Samurai.

We ended up getting all 3 and all ended up being as good as advertised.I went with the bourbon buffalo sandwich which was incredible. The garlic fries that come with being somewhat life changingly awesome, were a complete surprise and a total complement to the BBQ goodness of the sandwich.The atmosphere inside is nice, somewhat modern with touches of wood and holiday decorations that didn't feel cheesy.Remeber to wash down your meal with one of CBCs awesome beers.

I told him over and over that it was okay and he didnt need to worry but he continued to push and then got me a free burrito card (not complaining) however the young girl at the register was very catty at me, and asked right in front of me 'why does she deserve that?'

I wanted just a gel polish change but they would only let me do it with a manicure. I had to take it upon myself to find the board that had the gel polish nail colors. And most of them seemed old, definitely not a color selection thats impressing. The guy doing my nails seemed to be in a rush and was not paying attention to what he was doing. My nails were not filed straight and when I pointed it out he got annoyed. Then when buffing my nailed he cut the skin on my fingers.

Except for one injection where I felt some pressure, I didnt feel any of the other injections. At one point, I was going to ask him, 'Did you start yet?' I received Juvederm Volbella because I only wanted filler in my upper lip because it was very small and thin in ratio to my bottom lip. Also, I wanted a more natural looking lip, rather than one that has obviously been filled. When Dr. Slater completed the process, I was shocked because there was no bleeding, during or after the injection and I never bruised either. In the next 3 days, my lip did not swell above that which it appeared at the clinic. The overall experience from start to finish was perfect!

I started looking at all of the frames on the wall and every time I would pull some off the shelf and try them on, I didnt like the way it looked on me or the way it felt on my nose. I did this a few times and still had no luck and became extremely overwhelmed very quickly. After about six minutes or so of doing this, one of the employees came over and started to pull things off for me to try on. The frames that he picked I would have never chosen for myself. And I freaking loved them all. I have extremely terrible vision so my lenses tend to be very thick and weigh down my glasses. He asked to see my prescription and recommended different frames that would be comfortable and fit well when the glasses were made. Two employees assited me while I was at the store and not only were they extremely well informed and helpful, but they were so incredibly kind! I've never had such a great experience picking out glasses before, ever. I've always been the kind of person that wears contacts out in public, but I'm definitely going to be wearing my glasses way more often because I absolutely love, love, LOVE the ones I ended up buying. And I would have never picked them out if it wasn't for those employees. I told my brother about the experience I had and he's going next week to check it out!

The place looked to be about half full but perhaps they were short staffed?We did get our drinks ordered and delivered quickly (ok one good thing) but from there it took 50 minutes for us to get our food ordered and out from the kitchen. I went with the sliders and my table mates both got the grouper sandwich. My sliders arrived luke warm at best, had stale buns, were overcooked and lack any flavor. As a side, I picked homemade chips that were cold, not crispy and again not really tasty. At this point, we were late to get back from lunch or I would have sent everything back. Service was spotty throughout with my water glass going empty on two occasions and no real feedback on why things were so slow.Sorry to say you can do much better than here and this will be a land soon forgotten.",

Mario's may look a little 'commercialised' with all the 'Italian Grandma' (or should I say Nona) decor but I found it to be really cute and cosy. The servers are friendly too (I was delighted to hear the English accent of one of the waiters as he busied to and fro - a little slice of home!) and very attentive. Our server was really sweet and friendly without coming off like a pest - she was very good at gauging when we needed something like a drink or an appy. My friends have varying tastes in food and Rob is just plain fussy, but we were able to find something that suited all our palettes. I had the Ceasar Salad Piadini off the lunch menu which was really fresh and filling too, for a salad. The sangria here is soooo nice, I had two and think I may have drank them too quickly as they were so good! Rob had the traditional burger - lovely juicy patty on a soft bun with home fries and fresh salad - who can argue with that? Jenn and Michelle shared a platter of crispy fried goodies. All in all, super happy and the spot on the balcony we were on was perfect! We'll be here for a few more days at least so I wouldn't rule out popping in again :)",

It wasnt busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand.

She told us that if we sit at the bar, the food is 20% off and when we nodded, she said 'seat yourself' in a rude and unwelcoming manner. She failed to smile at us or make us feel welcome throughout this exchange. We found seats at the bar, and the bartender was nice to us, although she took a while to acknowledge us and bring us hot sauce when we asked for it. I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part. When we finished eating, we sat for over 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged.  The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us. I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going. After waiting, she finally said 'Ill be right with you.' It took her another 5 minutes to be 'right with us.' She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before. The food was mediocre for the price that we paid. For a nice and pricey cafe, the staff was very rude. I could have very well spent my money elsewhere that is even busier but still receive superb service. Would I recommend this place to anyone? Not at all. *** my friend is also a waitress, so we were being generous with our expectations and even with our tip.***",

She would always run to the back as soon as customers came in. But this time when the other workers were busy and she had to step forward and actually do customer service like her job describes, she did a very poor job of it. She said her name is Hannah. She has blue hair, a lip ring, and gauged ears if that helps describe her. She was rather soft spoken and when I asked her to speak up a bit so I could hear better she suddenly gave me attitude at my request. So the whole process of dishing up my ice cream was far from pleasant. I then proceeded to ask a question regarding other workers and she snapped at me to 'JUST HAVE A GOOD DAY' and stormed off to the back. Extremely rude. Apparently she has done something similar to a friends friend of mine. She seems to have the lack of decent people skills, and lack of work effort.

It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors.

Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! The bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out. We sat down, lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins! As if that wasn't enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until 6 AM .

Overall, the food is usually quite good, but occasionally the flavor, quality, and portions can be inconsistent.  Part of the issue might be that by trying to execute on so many different types of Japanese cuisine, they can't be excellent at all of them.  There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food.They have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way).The yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites.It has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant.Early and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours)Service is usually good, but can be slow when the restaurant is really busy, especially at dinner.

There were people / staff standing around doing nothing initially and still did not come to ask us anything.  The music was so terribly loud from the party side  we could not  hear each other nor even converse with the waitress when she finally did come. Most of us developed headaches .We finally ordered and it took over an hour for the kids pasta to even come out. Close to the end we could not wait anymore. The kids were asleep on the bed/seating area. We had to get up and leave Before our dinner even arrived.  The waitress told me to go get some fresh air from outside.  And that the food should be ready soon.  it was 28° and raining, by the way.  Was she out of her mind!  1/2 of us left while the others waited for the food to come still...

Their reason was that they had a fire in their office and when I asked, they reported that they did, in fact, have mover crews and trucks available, but the manager decided to bring the crews in to clean up the office instead of taking care of the appointments that they had already committed to. I certainly hope there were other extenuating circumstances.  It seems like a better choice would have been to hire a cleaning crew and kept the moving crews and trucks working to take care of the customers.     Move Drs also told me twice they would find another company to move me later that same day but I never received either a call from a new mover, nor a follow-up call from Move Drs. All of this was last minute and ended up costing me substantially more in surcharges since I did not have a prior scheduled appointment. . To me, Move Drs views their business as a one-time customer exposure with little attention to any repeat business and cares nothing about service",

OK, fine, at least I will get to eat dinner, and at this point it's too late to order delivery or pickup anywhere else.At 3.5 hours, I contacted them again and subsequently received an email saying the order was cancelled because it was after 9:00, and the restaurant was closed.  I realize the GrubHub shares the blame here, but this is abysmal customer service from City Thai.  It is honestly inexcusable.  It is one thing to need to cancel an order because of weather, or driver issues, etc, but to provide (sparse) updates confirming that the order will be delivered and then simply close is un-freaking-believable.

(It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out. We both just thought ours tasted funny. Grad school has rotted our brains.)The unforgivable part of the experience came next. A couple of young college students were seated next to us. They ordered fries and were brought waters. My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters. 'Is that a shrimp?' I heard them ask.The waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!But it wasnt only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didnt notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said hed make it right.Instead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it. The couple, thoroughly mortified, left. We quickly finished our margaritas and went on to Julios down the street for our second...",

This quinoa bowl would scare anyone away from being vegetarian if it was the first vegetarian dish that they ever had.

I was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.Point of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM.

Until one day some friends suggested me meet there for dinner so when we look again the 'r' miraculously appeared.

We ordered four of the signature pizzas: Simple White, The Cure, Chicken Coup Deville and the I-95. These were all superb and 50% off on Mondays! I also tried their lamb sliders but as a lamb snob I much rather stick with traditional Greek and Turkish venues. We were a party of four and left with leftovers so the portions are reasonable.

The woman at the drive-thru window got snippy when I expressed the view that 15 minutes wasnt very fast for 'fast food.' 'We fry chicken every 15 minutes,' we were told. So, when someone sees that youre running low on your primary product, rather than getting ready to replenish the stock, you wait until the clock says its time? I can tolerate a degree of rudeness.

I ended up finishing the entire bowl. Each table has  a chilli oil bottle, and a spice bottle as condiments if you choose to flavor up your food. The gyoza was a good balance between vegetables and meat, it was accompanied with soy sauce. It wasn't as flavorful as I would like it but it certainly wasn't bad. The takoyaki balls were good for their price--the presentation was beautiful. Each ball was stuffed with a generous amount of chopped octopus. I wish it was cooked a little longer for the inside was a bit too mushy for me, but don't get me wrong, with the sauces and bonito and seaweed flakes it was plenty flavorful. The environment was a very modern rustic, definitely great for a quick casual bite. The staff was nice but a bit more quiet than I'm use to for a ramen place.

I'm not a picky coffee drinker, but I was only able to choke down one sip. My cousin ordered the soft scrambled eggs with mushrooms. He took one bite and left the rest because it was such an unappealing pile of snotty looking eggs. He is a 20 something year old guy who will eat literally anything, so the rest of us at the table had to take a bite to see what was so terrible about it.

We went in between 4 and 4:30 and there were no other diners there.  The server took our order and then she and the cook just hung around the front counter---he on his phone most of the time.  There seemed to be no action going on in the kitchen at all.  We ordered the dolmades for an appetizer and they were very good but tiny and overpriced at 5 for $6.95.  Then we waited and waited---still no action in the kitchen.  The server never checked on us.  Finally, the meal appeared (we are still the only diners In the place ). My daughters chicken kabob was so dry that she had to ask for some yogurt to dip it in and my little meat patties were so hard that I could hardly cut them.  Right before we were served we heard a timer go off, so considering the lack of action in the kitchen and the condition of the meat and chicken, I think they must have just reheated the entree.  The rest of the plate consisted of plain white rice and some garden salad greens with a basic vinaigrette dressing.  The server never came back after we were served.  When She brought the checkmentioned to her how dry the chicken was, she said--'oh, really?'  This was around $40.00 with tip and we left extremely unsatisfied.  Not worth the calories or the money.  Its hard to believe that we were in the same place with all the rave reviews about the food and service.Thank you for your reply.  Evidently our experience was not the average because the reason we visited Troy was because of the good reviews.  Thats why we were so surprised and disappointed by the unappetizing food and poor service.  I accept your explanation that the meat and chicken were cooked to order but, still, the chicken was extremely dry and the little meat patties were hard and tough.

My delivery options are quite limited in the new neighborhood so I couldnt believe my luck as I read the menu for this place.  I thought I must be dreaming as I read all of the delicious sounding items, and I triple checked to make sure they delivered.  Reasonably priced, and they were open. Great!  I place my order.  2 hours later, no food.  I call, and a young lady says that its coming up now. Wth??! After I protest, she offers me a lemonade. Blank stare. Go figure.  Finally, about 20 minutes later, food arrives.Heres the kicker- the food was actually GOOD.  The breakfast potatoes I got were downright DELICIOUSLY spicy and tasty, with the bell peppers and onions perfectly grilled.  I had ordered a turkey and cheese with EXTRA mayo, lettuce, tomato, and ONION, CUT in HALF. They sent a sandwich with NO mayo and not cut.  I am very picky, hence the reason I take the time to very carefully specify how I would like my food prepared.  When it is nothing like I ordered, it signifies to me that I am not important enough for you to even care about TRYING to prepare my meal the way I asked (and paid) you to do it. FAIL.Turns out, the sandwich was very good, the bread was perfectly soft, but the lack of care in preparation means Ill NEVER have another one.  Plus, had I not had Hellmans in the fridge, we would have had a REAL problem, as I dont do sandwiches with no mayo. Period.The owner called me when Grub Hub called her, and explained that she is a 'full service' restaurant, and she does the delivery orders 'when she can fit them in'. Had this been my establishment, I would have comped this entire meal for goodwill, and offered to try and get it right on a different day, thus ensuring a second visit from a first time patron/new neighbor/potential regular (I eat out 6 of 7 days a week, most unfortunately).  Oh well.  Not my business.  I will offer this:  if you dont have the capacity to do delivery service, then you should not try to do delivery service.Good luck to you.",

You can pick and choose the contents of your congee and side dish to your likely -- very much like the many build-your-own noodle dishes at places like Deer Garden and Cattle Cafe.

The tasting is $85; we also opted for the drink pairing $45. There were 13 courses that were paired with four wines and two beers. They take pride in working with local farmers and ranchers to create small plates using fresh seasonal ingredients. As a result, the menu is ever-changing. Our first trio of plates, were paired with LConti Brut/Blanquette de Limoux/France. Funyuns and caviar, such a perplexing first bite. We were in for a treat.Pimento, this might just be the perfect hors-doeuvre. I could eat these all day. Beet Trifle with grilled mushroom and blue cheese cookie. This was oddly delicious. The next pairing was Adelberts Philosophizer Saison/Austin. We were hooked from the first sip.Yellowtail, carrot, pistachio miso, caramel - I thought anticipated this dish as a favorite, it was enjoyable but one of my least favorite of night.Morel, avocado - earthy, rich and perfectly creamy.The next two dishes were paired with 2013 Weingut Robert Weil Trocken/Rheingau,Germany.Scrambled egg, crawfish boil. This was positively scrumptious. More, please!Carbonara, I adore it when chefs play with food. Squid noodles and all the flavor of a carbonara.The next wine was 2011 Gerard Bertrand 'Grand Terroir' Tautavel Blend/Cotes du Roussilion, France.Radish, pork fat, smoked cashew - a wonderful surprise of flavors.Duck, radiccio, loquat - this was another dish, I expected to standout, but it was also a least favorite.Our last wine of the evening was 2013 Franco Espanolas Diamante/ Rioja, Spain.Sunchoke cereal, was the most unusual dish. It reminded me of Cocoa Pebbles, I mean that in the best way.Chamomile, berries - This was the best dessert that I can recollect. The berries had such intense flavor it was incredible! I ate my husbands too.The final pairing was Prearis Quadrupel/Belgium.Mesquite bean, chocolate - This play on the churro was very yummy, but I gave mine to the husband after a taste since I wanted to savor the berries from the last dessert.We were blown away. It was a phenomenal meal and service was top notch. My two least favorite dishes were still wonderful, but they were familiar.

We loved it here.The Beantown Diner lost a lot of respect in our book the last time we went.  We stepped in and waited for a seat (the entire restaurant was full, there were no open tables).  At least three waitresses told us 'take a seat wherever youd like.'  There were no seats.  When the third waitress told us to take a seat yet again, my fiance simply said 'I dont see any that are open' to which we both got a 'ugh, whatever' pissed off look before waitress number three stormed off.  That was enough for us.  No place should treat their customers like that.  Great food, but after being treated like a piece of trash I dont know if well be returning anytime soon.",

            "input": "I dont know who these sales tactics work on but I guess they wouldnt be employed if they didnt. We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. We call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying 'master of excellence'. Im sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesnt have physical space to display that.He tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN well talk price.Lets pause for a minute. Suppose youre a Honda dealer and you honestly dont have a relatively popular car. Wouldnt you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, dont you? Of course, you would. Either he didnt have a car or he knew he didnt want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.So he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess its working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didnt stop. He called me like 8 times and I didnt answer.We went to that other place the same day and bought the car. In summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Dont ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesnt mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply dont know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.Heres a more detailed account of our buying process: http://www.yelp.com/biz/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw",

Please understand that I'm talking about a very simple, 1-item order which would have normally taken only a couple of minutes to prepare.Indeed, what should have been a quick in/out experience ends up lasting 10-15 minutes. And, when you're the only customer in her store, you're acutely aware that you just don't rate.To make matters worse, when you ask Celine to put a little extra mayonnaise on your sandwich, she instead hands you a small To Go container of mayonnaise so that you have to inconveniently add it yourself. I don't know whether to call these transgressions poor business practices, or just plain rudeness.Lest you think I'm being too harsh on Celine, this same sad event has happened to me twice only weeks apart.Below is a list of my individual star ratings by category.

However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.Our visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  When we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  That was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!On the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.  I don't know if ownership has changed, or someone just stopped caring, but the place seems run by kids who don't know or care about cleanliness and customer service.  So sad to see our favorite restaurant come to this end.",

My boyfriend then tipped her a wad of dollar bills and still nothing.Also, while we were taking a moment to decide what to buy, two other people came in and stood behind us. The girl leaned to look past us  and said 'Do you guys know what you want?' Still very visibly annoyed. Overall, Im disappointed and pretty upset.

I came in to use their nail printer (that I found out about via IG!) but the result wasnt that great - I used a personal image that I sent beforehand, and it the result wasnt what I was expecting. I wish there had been a little more communication about what kinds of pics yield the best results because I would have brought more options then.I also had some simple nail art done - highly skilled artists that gave me exactly what I was looking for, but paid just over $100 for a relatively 'simple' set (no charms or crazy nail art) which was a little surprising.

It doesnt matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. Ive been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcons hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager didnt even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezys ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifas babys momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - 'Hi, Im AmberRose and I will be your server today...' All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left 'OH, OK!' and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she wouldve given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you dont, you have to go see for yourself.Besides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when Im ignored by my waiter but I didnt even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it didnt even phase me.The food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. Im really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I dont care if theyre country or city. I want them out of a shell. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and theyll bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. Try this iHop but remember, do not come extremely hungry. Theres always a wait.",

For example they have vegan cheese and avocado so when you veganize an item you dont give up several essential toppings and pay the same price as omnis. At breakfast the 'how latin' is the major winner, with tofu and vegan sausage, wonderful but oiley sauce, black bean mango salsa, extra toast because the biscuit is not vegan, and vegan cheese grits. At $9 is also among the best values in portland. No more nickle and diming vegans to sub cheaper ingredients that their carnivorous counterparts. Dont forget about dinner, they have a happy hour where you can get a vegan quesadilla or tacos for $4 and a beer for $3.  This place trumps vita for vegan alberta st breakfast, and is the winner for vegan dinner on the street as well. Dont sleep in and get slammed with a wait with all the omnis, go early and bring your dogs, it will be a great experience.  They open at 7am and there is never a wait till about 8:30ish. The only downside is that they dont have soy creamer for the coffee, so if you dont drink your coffee black you may be a little disappointed, i just drink my coffee or tea before going.

I moved to Atlanta last March,  and I've been looking for the perfect taco spot. I think I found it!!!My sister and I decided to have a girls day. We decided to go see the new star trek film. The film was pretty good, but my mind was on food.  I purposely left the house on an empty stomach. The ultimate goal was to stuff my face. Me so hungry! The film ended, and we headed to the exit, my sister said, do you want to grab some food? I said, duh! She said, how about tacos? I said, yes, tacos is good! We pulled up to bartaco,  and it was time for tacos. We entered the rather clean establishment and a confused gentleman greeted us. I overlooked his awkwardness,  and he walked us to a cute little table. I loved the cruise ship decor, I was pretty impressed, I was in paradise. We decided to look at the menu while we waited for our waitress. I was pleased with the menu selections. I decided on fried oyster, shrimp, and falafel tacos. I was ready to order. Where is the waitress, my sister asked.My sister decided to get up and look for help. I sat there with a deep hunger. I want my tacos. This is pure torture. I looked up from my menu, and my sister and a handsome gentleman walked my way. He introduced himself, and he apologized for the inconvenience. You know what, he had me at, hello! I love good customer service. Christoph was an excellent ending to a rocky beginning. Christoph explained the menu etc, and he gave us tacos on the house. He left us in good hands as well. Our waitress Aimee was a breath of fresh air.Aimee took our order. I ordered fried oyster, shrimp, falafel, and the lobster taco. My sister ordered fried oyster, fish, and the lobster taco. She ordered a mushroom tamale as well. We decided on gaucomle and chips. We both ordered margaritas. Omg, the food is excellent. Everything was super fresh. I'm serious, even the water was good. I was in taco heaven. I really like how the staff treated us. I felt like royalty.  The manager even introduced himself. He was a real treat. He was a chocolate treat.  I want to thank you all for a wonderful experience. Omg, I almost forgot. The manager walked me, and my sister to our car, you see, it was raining pretty hard, and he took out an umbrella and walked us to the front of the establishment. I got to touch his muscular body.

Part of this was because they thought everyone in the party had arrived, even after admitting that they had JUST been told two of couples were half an hour away, they had given our rooms to someone else!When I checked in I was enthusiastically told I was 'upgraded' from a double room to a King room (which is what I had booked anyway), and it was one of the newly renovated rooms!  How exciting, right?  Except it was right on the atrium, which is heavily under construction.  I get it, hotels need to remodel on occasion, but they just did not handle this well.  We were told what hours work was scheduled and that the evenings/night/mornings were quiet time.  HA!  Construction started over an hour early each day and went well into the evenings.  Being woken up at 6:30AM on a Saturday by loud yelling and heavy equipment was not fun.  It was even less fun on Sunday.The TV has annoying settings to force you to see ads and such - took multiple clicks to actually watch the damn thing.The WiFi was really bad.  I was able to surf the net, and pictures on Facebook and the like took only a tad bit to load, but could not even attempt to stream from my home server or use a VPN for work.Parking was inconvenient at best - a lot of the parking lot is taken up by construction equipment and such.  Their lot is very strangely laid out.  This made getting to the hotel or onto the two highways extremely difficult and annoying.  You look at the location and think its great, because its at a major intersection, but it is a pain in the ass to get on the highways.",

This location is spacious and modern, something that the campus location could never achieve given the limited real estate. They offer a variety of beer on tap (including several local breweries) and plenty of seating, which should be interesting given they are across the street from Cafe Mueller at the HEB. The doner kebab, VERTS' claim-to-fame, is still as delicious as ever and is a great addition to the Mueller development. Perhaps the most improved aspect of this location is the efficiency of the food-assembly line. The Drag location has always suffered from sluggish preparation that resulted in much longer waits than necessary given the number of people working behind the counter. The Mueller VERTS has a much more well-oiled system in place that results in almost Chipotle-esqe speeds.Be sure to use your Go Local card!",

They consistently never include a single napkin in my delivery bag, consistently forget to put avocado on my sandwich when I pay extra for it, consistently either drown my sandwich in dressing when it calls for 'regular' or only put it on half of the sandwich when I ask for 'EZ' (thinking that maybe Ill get a regular amount if I ask for less), and consistently give me a soggy, loosely wrapped bundle of lettuce and lunch meat when I order an Unwich. Jimmy Johns in general is NEVER my first choice. Id rather pay the same price, if not less, and get a sub from Publix that uses meats and cheeses that are worth the ridiculous markup.

This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership, and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable. The place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code. The streets are narrow, so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around. Check in time is at 4pm. Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson, who invites you to breakfast and wont take no for an answer. They extract $20 from you to make sure you show up. (After seeing the place, I sacrificed my $20.)  Finally, a bellman has you follow his golf cart in your car to find your room. By that time, its 5pm. We were excited to bring the kids to play on the 18 hole putt putt course right on property. Sounds much better than it is. However, when we got to the club rental place, they told us all equipment had to be back by 5:15pm. We had 6 minutes if we cared to use them. Of course, checkout time is 10am. Which us fine if you want to get to the parks, but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities. The golf stand didnt open till 9. Ok, one 'resort fee' not put to good use. At least the pool we swam in was well heated. The room was disgusting, including countless hairs belonging to past visitors (owners, perhaps??) on the sheets, blankets and tub. The towels were threadbare and had rust stains that looked like streaks from somebodys butt (nice), and the shower had a crusty dried booger on the wall. We were in the 'deluxe 1 BR suite', but I cant imagine it was any different than the cheaper studio. Scammed again. I would rather spend a night in my car than stay here again, and I would no sooner buy than repeatedly poke myself in the eye.

Every prescription he did for me was wrong, and every prescription was wrong because he did not test properly in the first place.   He rushed through the exam  - failed to ask about dilation,  failed to use a reading card etc - and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at 2 min increments  (he was also 'examining' several other patients during the same 15 min stint.).On top of that, he engaged in aggressive sales practices - my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses/lenses.  But here, in front of me, he set the price of a very $$$$ glasses I did not need  - luckliy I was wary by that point and did not make the purchase.  He also spent more time explaining different payment options than hed spent  actually  examining my eyes. The  prescription he gave me was a disaster - it made me naseous and dizzy .  I had to go back and have the part-time doctor make things right - which she did. But none of these problems should have happened in the first place.  And there  was a run-around about whether I would be 'allowed' to get a refund for  the pair of glasses I did get there -- based on the faulty prescription the doctor there had provided!!!  (They were also unable to locate one of my prescriptions, because it was never written up. Looks like the  doctor had, literally, phoned it in.)  I had to get very pushy to get basic good business  practice, and simple fairness, out of this shop.   I never dreamed getting an eye exam would lead to a situation so tense and adversarial, but there you are. You go to these places in good faith - expecting a competent eye exam by a competent practioner.   In my experience, the main doctor here operates in bad faith -- and is backed by a sales team that is aggressive and incompetent too.",

It definitely met our expectations! The only bad thing was that it took a while to be seated, but we weren't in a big rush. We both had a glass of wine, which was great. The first course was a summer tomato soup - so flavorful and delicious, and they also served bread with the best whipped butter I've ever had. For my main dish I ordered  pan seared scallops served with pea greens and grapefruit butter, which was deliciously flavorful but not too rich. The scallops were cooked perfectly - not too rubbery. A highlight of the meal was my friend's dessert cheese plate, which was absolutely the most unique and flavorful cheeses I have ever tasted. I also found out when I was there that the restaurant does a $25 wine + plate tasting every Thursday, which is themed each week. I will definitely be going back for one of these events soon!",

So much for celebrating my bday and not even be able to sit with my family. It was Tuesday 7/28 morning and they said there is not enough room to fit 3 tables together. There was 3 tables around us that were empty when we sat down. There was room to put 3 tables together, but instead he thought it was smarter to put 2 tables together for  6 of us and another 2tables together for only 4 people. Right there money lost for the restaurant, cause they could of sat another 4 people on that unnecessary table.We got there at 11am & waited 40min to get drinks. Thank goodness I brought my own drinks for the kids. 40min for Orange juice!!! I ordered the kid meals with the drink and they still had to wait 1 hour for their food. While the adults waited 1hour & 30mim. We got out of the restaurant at 1:10.It was breakfast at lunch time. They had to be understaffed, because I could tell our waiter was struggling, he was nice but feel bad for him for who he has to work with. The manager came and 'apologized', comped part of our meal. But it was not good enough. I still believe he didnt want to help to sit us together and used poor judgement setting up the tables. There was no need to put 2 tables together for only 4 people. They were acting like trendy snobby hipsters, I feel they would of being more accommodating at an ihop. I regret my decision of not going to kerbey lane instead. Plus the kitchen must of set a plastic container on and the entire restaurant was filled with the burn plastic smell. One of my family members had to go outside. NO ONE apologized for that, people on other tables were asking what happened kimberly is the greatest no one said sorry.If you are waiting for a table right now or are planing on going here and you get there and there is a long wait. It is because the front of the house is not functioning right. It takes a long time to get your drinks after u sit down, and will take at least 1 hour to get your food.Breakfast was good. My 6 year old had the traditional Benedict, he ate the entire thing. My 3 year old had the carrot french toast. It was good huge serving, very very sweet.Me and my sister had the migas steak Benedict. It was good, just felt short on hollandaise, dish was a lil dry.My husband had the goat cheese omelet with caramelized onions and artichoke, it was my favorite dish.My mother in law got the traditional Benedict, she enjoyed themMy dad ordered the crab Benedict. The eggs were shaped like a poached egg but it was more like egg whites with spinach and bacon that were put on a mold. He was expecting a poached with a layer of spinach and bacon but he said it was still good.As of the other part of my party. Couldnt tell what they had ordered.",

It was 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time we sat down until our food arrived.  In that time we had to ask for water and coffee every time, our server came by voluntarily one time and when I asked for some bread for our son we were brought biscuits that were 'on the house'. I understand that it was a special occasion, but the restaurant was only half full and of those tables I would guess that most had reservations, so they knew what they were getting in to for the day.When our food finally did arrive half of it came  a full 5 minutes after the first half.  The one order of steak and egg was both cold and missing the egg.  We sent it back, after 5 minutes it returned not re-fired but simply re-heated with an egg thrown on top, so that the steak was then over cooked.I am so sad to have to remove bluehour from our list of favorites, or in fact choices, Im afraid the other restaurants in the chain will likely fall off the list as well.",

I made an account just to write this review, so.....I went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept: grilled cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread! Delightful.We walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be. There were all these crayon-scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter, so automatically Im like, oh, this is one of THOSE places. Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. As I was getting my tea, I noticed the strange, vague smell of bad eggs. I thought this was due to the fountain stations proximity to the trash can. I was incorrect. I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I couldnt quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. I went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy-haired slacker employee. I told him he should smell my drink. He said, 'No, Im good. Ill check on it, though.' He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, Id be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.The sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches. Theyre more like panini sandwiches, made in a big flat press. Theyre greasy, the bread doesnt adhere to the cheese, and theyre mediocre in flavor at best. You could make a better sandwich at home for much less.",

I also told her that the color on my toes didn't math my fingers and she insisted it did. Once I got outside and seen it didn't and the mess left on my skin, I immediately went back and spoke to the owner. He became rude and told me he would fix two finger nails (at minimum five were a mess). He also said he didn't care about my toes. I made an appointment to come back the next morning. When I got there the first woman had an attitude and told me my toes were not her problem. Then she got up and told me she would not do anything. Then the women who initially messed up sat down to do my nails... Unacceptable! I had to argue with the owner to get my toes and fingers done correctly. I was not mad at the initially employee, I just didn't want her to mess up again and I would've continued to go if I was handled appropriately. Although the two former women that did my nails kept me coming back, I refuse to give them anymore of my money ($65 biweekly) due to their customer service. They had no concern for a customer who went to them faithfully and referred friends/family to them.",

Damage that WAS NOT there prior to taking my car into the Monro. Our car has only 81341 miles on it--damage of this magnitude is ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous.  As a loyal customer I expect  my car to be repaired in a timely manner, completely and without additional cost to us.  I will say this, that after several phone calls this evening to the shop close to the end business, Rick, the manager on duty, finally got a hold of Fitz on his cell phone and Fitz authorized payment of a tow truck from Natick to Watertown to get our car back the the shop. This good faith gesture communicates culpability and interest in making us whole. Therefore, I have faith that they will make this right.  Monro was are 'go-to' place for several years and now weve lost faith in their abilities.   Expect an update review.  They need to prove they are still worthy of our trust and confidence.",

I had Asmara tea, which tasted like Christmas, and he had banana juice, which is possibly the most delicious juice of all time. Even though we were more than full after the meal, we split the Coppa pistachio for desert. No regrets, that was amazing too. Service was also well-timed and the atmosphere was very pleasant.

There were about 15 bikes available and we tried them all several times and one by one got the bikes out.  After a 2 hor ride we delivered the bikes back at the same station, locked them all and double checked and discovered that 4 of the bikes showed duration and costs on the display and one bike had a dead display. At around 6.30pm I received an email saying I didn't deliver my bike back yet. I called the indicated helpline and spent an expensive phonecall (using a Dutch cellphone) to try to explain to a kind lady where the bike was and what had happened.  Finally she decided that a technician was going to check whether the bike was at the station and would reset the bikes computer. I am now waiting for that confirmation. If the bike is not there it will cost me $ 1500! But what can you do when the display stops functioning and you can't check whether it has been correctly delivered?

There was already a long line going down the sidewalk and if we had arrived any later, we may had to have waited to get a table. When the restaurant doors opened, Vikram Vij himself, the owner of the restaurant, greeted everyone individually as they walked in. He also would stop by our table a couple times throughout the meal to ask us what we thought of the food.My favorite part of the meal occurred even before my table ordered any food. The servers stop by the table with a tray of goodies where one could just grab a piece to eat in a single bite. Each one is flavorful in spices in its own unique way and they really do end up whetting the appetite. One of these things they bring to the table is their chai tea which was particularly excellent.For our entrees, we ordered a bunch of dishes which included samosas, eggplant curry, mutton kebab, and much more. What I loved about each of their curry dishes is that the sauces are different for each one and are quite distinct from one another. Three of the more memorable dishes for me are their lamb popsicles, portobello mushroom curry, and spicy goat curry. The lamb is super tender and has it's signature gamey taste laid atop a pool of yellow curry which was my favorite sauce amongst all the dishes. The portobello mushroom curry includes a thicker and creamier curry sauce with meaty and hearty mushrooms that were cooked perfectly. The spicy goat curry was great in that.. well... unlike the other sauces, this one had a nice spicy kick to it. I felt that this dish paired well with the mango lassi which is thick and refreshing.",

So, the take away from all this is the website is useless, the phone prompt is useless, and the only way to actually know wtf is going on with your bag is to talk to a person directly.",

I ordered online delivery of a cake, but then tried to immediately  cancel the order once I saw that shipping (within Cambridge, to an address only several blocks away!) was 43 dollars.  I tried to call to cancel, but they were closed, and I filled out the online customer service request immediately to cancel.  They never cancelled my order.  However, they still charged me for the cake and the delivery, which was a day LATE anyway.  I called today to get some of the delivery fees refunded, and the employee told me they 'did get my email message, but it was too late to cancel the order.'  Why did they not contact me?  I dont know.  The employee then told me I would have to call the store directly to get a refund for delivery fees.  She said she would call them for me, and that I would get a call back right away.  Nobody called me back.  What horrible customer service.UPDATE (5/23):I forgot to mention that when the cake was going to be delivered, I got a call from an unidentified person saying I was going to receive a packaged surprise that morning.  Since it was Mothers Day I was all excited, thinking I was going to get a gift.  But no, it was Rosies Bakery calling me, the buyer, rather than the recipent, to notify of an upcoming delivery.  So that really sucked, staying home, waiting for a  Mothers Day present that never came.  Bummer.  But today I actually managed to get someone on the phone who would refund the delivery fees to me, since the cake did get delivered to my recipent, even though it was woefully late.  But it did take three days of calling Rosies to accomplish this feat.  So this review remains a ONE STAR.",

First of all, they didn't have me in their system and know that I was just there 2 months ago, then after I booked the appointment, they called back to say they needed to reschedule because they got it confused with a different day, so they are very unorganized. This was a big inconvenience considering I'm very busy making appointments with my job and had to reschedule with an important client. After they called back to reschedule, before we got off the phone, I was asked for my groupon voucher number which I said I couldn't view at the time but said I will bring it to my appointment. They said no, they have to have it before I get there, and they wanted my credit card number to pay for the services I already paid for with my groupon? I gave them the option to do the right thing or they will lose a loyal and local customer and they didn't care.  I cancelled the appointment and got my groupon refund, but wanted to share with world that this place is not worth your time and money.

The menu seems to have a wide variety of foods from the simple rice and noodle dishes to the more elaborate like braise lamb hot pot.  The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor, with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded.  But that's where the good side ends.  Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down (at 11am just when they opened).  She came to our table 3 times in a short span of 5 minutes.  We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes (Hand shredded chicken and 7-flavor deep fried squid) and a couple of entree dishes (Fried noodles with chicken, Mapo tofu rice, Sauteed shrimp).  It took almost 35 minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch.  When the food dishes showed up at last, we were very disappointed at every dish.  The hand shredded chicken was more of cut-up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in.  The 7-flavour deep-fried squid tasted bland -- I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour.  The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special (including taste!).  The sauteed shrimps were not well de-veined so tasted bitter.  We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice?  Well, the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up, but the rice was too hard (tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight).  Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus!  To add to the poor service and bad quality food, we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten 3 times over!  If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer!  But we were honestly not interested in more of the same bad dishes.  We hope that Lucky Plus is just testing their kitchen process to make improvements and honing their waiting service to provide a more enjoyable experience for their customers.  But they will need to do this quickly as many traditional Chinese clients like myself would not likely go back after the one bad experience.",

I never knew there was a restaurant open at 3 in the morning that could still be so packed! After a wild night of karaokeing, my friend needed something to soak up all that beer in his belly, so we headed over. Somehow, at that late hour of the night, the server was in good spirits, on point, and efficient. We grabbed a table and ordered our food, with drinks following promptly. Here's where it got interesting. Some Brittish girl who designs for Abercrombie came over while my friend was in the bathroom and asked if she could sit down. I have a hard time saying no to a pretty face, so before I knew it, she had invited her friends to sit down, my friend was kicked out of his side of the booth and was sitting next to me, and I had given away half of my pizza.(Which was much less greasy this time).  It was definitely an interesting experience, and I don't think I would get it anywhere else. Can't wait to come back!",

(And Im not ashamed to admit that that was just last week.)Dua is admittedly not the most 'ethnic' restaurant out there -- you wont find an expansive menu with all sorts of obscure Vietnamese eats. But then again, this is downtown Atlanta, not Buford Highway. What you will find is a simple menu that appeals to most, if not all, palates, offering up many varieties of pho (a noodle soup), bun (a cold noodle dish), com (a rice dish), mi xao (a stir fried noodle dish), and salad.Ive had the opportunity to try quite a few of the dishes here, and theyre all quite good:- #1 Beef Pho (regular $6.25, large $6.95): A good-sized portion, though not the largest Ive seen. The flavor tends to be consistently spot on. Garnishes, however, are limited to a small plate of sprouts and basil leaves.- C3 Grilled Shredded Pork & Eggs ($6.95): One of my favorite dishes here. The pork is juicy, tender, and flavorful. But its the runny fried egg on top that brings everything together. Note that this dish ought to be pretty inoffensive, even to those completely unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine.- B1 Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($6.95): I cant get enough of the grilled pork here. Here, its served over cold vermicelli, very lightly dressed with, among other things, fish sauce (I think). Served with a crispy, chopped egg roll.- M1 Pork Mi Xao ($6.95): Stir fried noodles. Given the nature of this dish, its a bit blander and a bit less satisfying than the rest, but its still quite good.While Dua, like most casual downtown eateries, is only open for lunch, it gets absolutely slammed at that hour. The result is that their operation has grown to become pretty efficient -- stand in line against the wall, on which multiple copies of the menu are plastered; order at one of the two registers, where you pay and pick up a number; get your drink, silverware, and napkins; find a seat on the main level, outside, or downstairs; and wait for your food to be delivered. All very business. Note that most of the tables are designed for one or two diners, so  you might have to go outside, go downstairs, or move around some furniture for larger parties.Ill definitely be back -- maybe next week, Ill try for four.",

It is very much a mom and pop shop, and they are very patient with no sales pressure.  They were also not off put with my price point, unlike some of the other stores that I visited.  I enjoyed being able to browse the dresses instead of just having the sales person chose a few for me to try on.  With that said, the dress I chose was actually one that the salesperson chose for me, and probably would not have been a dress that I chose myself!  They also matched a beautiful veil with it that I purchased as well.  It was very sweet that they gave me a bottle of prosecco when I said yes to the dress!  They also gave my mom a mini bottle so that we could have a toast when we got back to the house.  So far, I am very pleased.

After standing on line for nearly an hour to get in, I was advised that the fish of the day, haddock, was only available in a fish taco, which I had no desire to eat, and told her so. At which point the waitress leaned into my face and said, 'you want my day?', with a very surly attitude, at which point I looked at her and said in just as surly a manner, ' I dont like chipotle.' At this point, another member of our group said shed try it, and I asked for something else and a black cherry soda. She came back after 15 mins and said they were out of black cherry, at which point I asked for a coke, getting just a bit exasperated by now, and off she went, only to come back with...the black cherry soda. The member of my party who had accepted the fish taco said it wasnt very good, and ended up eating about half of it. This place needs to improve its food and get rid of that waitress.",

The tragedy began when my mom who drank the bubble tea an hour before me complained about stomach pain and having to visit the washroom several times. I was skeptical when she first told me and dismissed it as just her having a sensitive stomach. However after a few minutes I realized I should take some precautions as I did not want to risk it. At that point I had only drank less than half of what was in my cup. Fifteen minutes or so passes by when I felt my stomach churning and at that moment I realized it wasnt just my old ladys sensitive stomach that was the problem: it was this cup of laxativ- I mean bubble tea. Thank goodness I stopped drinking it before WWIII happened in my bathroom. Not to mention, my Mom who rarely treats herself to take out/drinks ended up suffering due to your 'bubble tea'. On the bright side, if I ever have constipation problems, I can now purchase a cup-o-laxatives from your store instead of having to spend $14.99 from London Drugs. Talk about value for your money !",

(b) We found ants in the kitchen and bathroom, they sent pest control, we get back and the ants were still there. The room was directly from the 80's, the worst decorated room I have ever paid $200 per night.  (c) They moved us to a different room the exchange process took 3 hours. At one point we were waiting on the street for 45mins for the bellman who was getting new keys. He came back informing us that 3-4 kids were stuck in their room because another guest locked an common door (maybe take the lock off?) (d) When checking out they miscalculated our discount and we had another 20mins wait till the manager finally resolved the issue. Honestly for 200 per night, you can do much better. I am going to call their corporate offices on Tuesday (5/27/14) let's see what they say! The four/five stars are fake or paid stooges!",

After being told that it more than likely wasnt, and my battery was likely the problem (not likely, its a year old). They go back to do the oil change and test. An hour and a half later, they forgot to run the test on the starter, but surprise! The battery is fine. Im given a list of other things wrong with my car but told the starter is just 'chaotic'. After authorizing the repair on the cracked radiator hose, I wait for another hour for that to be repaired only for them to come out and tell me that my car wont start yet again and the starter needs to be replaced. This entire ordeal felt like a bait and switch. Im not mad about having to have repairs done on the car, seeing as my car is 9 years old and hasnt needed much work other than to replace the ignition and the locking mechanism in the drivers door. Repairs are expected and I knew this would happen at some point. Im mad because I told the employees that it was my starter, I was told I was wrong, the test was conveniently forgotten, and what should have taken maybe two hours at the most (which is what my normal mechanic at home said) it took more than 3.

Our friend took him up on it, though. The cheese pizza was good. It had that melted cheese pizza smell that would make the ninja turtles crap their pants, if they wore any.

We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. Our server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.After we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.After waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. After another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.Within the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.She ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now. If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time.",

Stronghorn is still less than 2 years new and growing very quickly so there will be more locations and times soon to make it easier to make a class.Jess, the founder, is genuinely one of the nicest, most fun people I know.  He is great at motivating you to push yourself beyond what you thought your body could do and making you laugh and smile while doing it.  The group is also still relatively small and has lots of social events, happy hours, and other nutritional challenges.  If you're looking for a new fitfam in Austin, Stronghorn will be a great new home for you.",

For dinner, prices jump significantly but they have a decent happy hour to make up for it. Food is good Mexican food for the area. Central Florida is not known for Mexican cuisine but there are a few hidden gems and this is one of them. If you are a salsa snob, then keep looking. The complimentary salsa tastes like it's from a jar. Otherwise, everything I have tried has been delicious.They have amazing service and a friendly staff. They are not afraid to customize the food options for you and keep the customer happy. They have mariachi on Thursday evenings which isn't my thing but I know that many people enjoy it and it's free entertainment while you eat.

His response 'its hard to say, it might take anywhere between 10 mins to 4 days.' I was so shocked at what he said, I just told him I will be back later to pick it up, so he said 'come back at your convince' So I go back at 5 PM and its still not ready... as soon as he saw me he said ' I have been waiting for you from the afternoon, but the thing is I just shut your phone so it will take another 10 mins...' at this time I lost it. I didnt know what to say to him anymore... Finally after an hour I got my phone back, and when he gave it to me he says, 'now that you have your phone back, I dont think you will need my services anymore' and walked just away.

These guys just dont know when to stop digging.  A mature and well-reasoned response, surely.  Please read my detailed, specific review below.  Note that I am in no way affiliated with any competing business; I live an hour away and was visiting friends for the weekend.  ***I was very disappointed in the haunted corn maze. I know the farm cant control the weather, but regardless, they were still charging full price for a maze where 3/4 of the corn was laid down by the wind.  It wasnt so much a maze as an open field of mud and darkness, covered in 2-3 inches of water and knee-high corn stalks.  It was very slippery and generally miserable; it didnt seem like any effort had been made to mitigate the mud (no hay or barkdust or anything visible under the water).  Definitely not suitable for children or the elderly.    The ticket lady told me that their real haunted maze had been flooded earlier in the day, so they were doing the scary stuff in their standard maze.  If that was the better-condition of the two mazes, then the other one must have been a literal swimming pool.Every staff member I interacted with seemed overworked and snotty (with the exception of the people doing the scaring IN the maze - they were all great and making the best of a bad situation).  One parking attendant directed me to a handicapped parking area (not marked as such) and then yelled at me when I parked there.  A different attendant raised her voice and took a very sarcastic tone with my girlfriend for failing to stay on the 'pedestrian path' through the parking lot (it was dark and poorly marked; there was no need for her tone).  The girl speaking over the PA system to make announcements sounded like the most bored, sarcastic teenager stereotype imaginable.  There was no attempt to create a festive or fun atmosphere. I also have to wonder at their decision to blast modern pop music over the PA system in the main area, because it carries over into the haunted maze and really ruins what little atmosphere remained.Since I assume that the corn wont magically stand itself back up after the wind storm, and I doubt that theyll be replacing their entire staff between now and Halloween, I would definitely skip this maze for the rest of the year.  I have heard that there are other locations on the same road, and I would definitely try one of those first, because they cant be any worse than Bella Organic Farm.",

I didn't want to write a negative review after my first experience (which was horrible), so I decided to give it a second shot. First time I was here, I had the chicken burrito. It was so bland. If you're going to put rice and beans in all your burritos, make sure they're well seasoned. Their onions are just very huge sloppy chunks. I felt like I was just biting into onions. For my second visit, I decided to go with their popular pork and Chile burrito, chicken quesadilla, nachos with the meat chili and guacamole. Burrito was once again super bland. Half of it didn't even have any meat in it, I thought they accidentally made the vegetarian one. Once I got to the meat, it was once again flavorless... the nachos came out with no meat chili which I had to pay $4 something extra for (good thing I checked my box before I left). The quesadilla was super soggy and dripping with liquid. The guac was under seasoned and didn't even have cilantro in it. Just overall another horrible experience. Anyone who says this place is good, is not a good person to ask for food recommendations. You're better off going to Taco Bell.",

This unscrupulous operation charged over $500 to rekey some locks, or $32/lock, about triple the normal $12-$14.  In addition, Avi charged both a service call and labor (normal practice is one or the other).  My associate did not catch the overcharging before swiping our company card.I initially thought the ludicrously high amount was a billing mistake.  Avi was slow to respond to multiple calls (took a couple weeks) and his tone was belligerent.  He only became responsive when I mentioned posting a review.  He promised to come back after conferring with his 'boss,' but that was over a week ago and no call-back.Reading the other reviews, the overcharging and poor service seem to be a systemic pattern with this company.",

My whole appointment was just one awful thing after another. 1. Upon my arrival Im told they dont have a hygienist so someone else will be doing my exam. Why would you schedule my appointment on a day there is no hygienist when I need a cleaning? 2. Assistant spent half an hour taking my x-rays because she couldnt get the machine placement correct. Do you know how uncomfortable it is to hold that contraption in your mouth because someone else isnt getting the camera position correctly.3. Assistant immediately began polishing my teeth and snagged my lip in the tool. First off, why are you polishing my teeth when my teeth havent even been cleaned yet? Also, as the person polishing my teeth, why are you not maneuvering my lip away from my teeth so you can polish the front of them without spinning my lip into your tool.4. The dentist? or whomever Anna Nguyen is, returned to actually clean my teeth, and used the ultrasonic. Thats fine, however the assistant was not paying attention and continued to suction my throat rather than the water coming from the tool. She also would look away causing her hand to move to then suction my lip or cheek instead of liquid.5. Once the cleaning was complete the assistant returned to struggling to polish my teeth and then flossed. At this time she missed both of my back molars but I did not say anything because I plan to just floss them myself and get out of there. 6. Lastly, I opted in the beginning of the appointment prior to knowing that the experience was going to be less than professional, for varnish to be put onto two teeth. The assistant proceeded to dab the varnish all over all my teeth, getting it onto my lips and piles of the product on  my teeth.  My lips are still sticky 2 hours later.  I really wanted to like this place but it seems that its a bunch of newly graduates or maybe interns working here.  The two who handled my appointment today were not even on their website as part of their 'Team'. Long story short, I will not be returning and I hope that no one else deals with the same.The Pros I can say is their front desk seems very knowledgeable, in particular their insurance specialist and the business itself seems very up-to-date with everything being digital.",

However, I'm also not usually in a rush when I come, it's a family meal, we come to relax and enjoy ourselves over a good meal.  The food I've had here makes up for the service and has always been good.  It's probably also the cheapest eat in town, for a table of three we often only spend $10 before tipping (we tip well, it's a family owned business).Summers are best here, we can enjoy the seating outside, enjoy the breeze on a sunny day, people watch, and be served outside.

He is very focused in helping you achieve your dance goals, as long as you articulate it. He'll also introduce you to new dance styles (if you're focused on one style like me). I like Leon because he not only teaches you at the studio, but he'll also connect with you outside the studio - and this speaks to a person who is serious about improving their dance technique like me. He'll check in with you outside of studio time, provide you with dance resources to make sure you get a certain concept right if it wasn't grasped during your lesson, and make you fully understand the culture of dance (if you care for it)! Receiving lessons from Leon is a pleasure because he not only has a passion for dancing, but you know that he really cares about his students.Outside of private lessons, Leon hosts outings to various salsa clubs in Boston and Cambridge (usually it's Havana Club in Cambridge). I don't take his salsa classes, but I've gone out with him and his students and it's always a good time. Lastly, he also hosts a dance video blog (www.passion4dancing.com) where he'll teach certain dance techniques. It's a true testament to his comprehensive teaching style.",

We picked up our pizzas and drove home which isn't to far about 10 minutes away. Anyways when we got home, I took a bite out of the hand pan pizza and it was completely raw!!! The dough wasn't even cooked, and I almost gagged! How in the world can someone give their customer an undercooked raw pizza! It's just awful! So naturally we called to let them know about the situation and asked if they could deliver the new pizzas to us, since it was their fault for messing up in the first place! Well long story short, they said they wouldn't because they did not deliver to our address, even though it was literally 10 minutes down the road in the next city over! So my husband decided he would just go grab the new pizzas...Well 30 minutes later my husband comes home with the new pizzas and guess what.....they were undercooked and RAW!!!! At this point I was just fed up, so I called dominos back, and told them they once again sold me undercooked pizzas...so the girl on the phone puts her manager on the phone, and I explained the situation. The manager then tells me she personally made the pizza and if she kept it in the oven any longer it would have burned! I told her well then you need to be re-taught how to make a pan pizza because what they should be doing to avoid it from burning the toppings or being undercooked is putting the dough in alone to cook a bit and then taking it out adding the toppings and putting it back in to cook! Clearly dominos needs to retrain these employees at this location! Anyways point to this story is my husband had to go back a third time for new pizza! While the other pizzas got cold! They didn't even want to credit us for the pizzas but they made sure we brought the other undercooked pizzas back! Like seriously they make me laugh!!! What are they going to do resell the pizza that should be trashed? What a joke! Needless to say, I contacted corporate and I hope they take this matter seriously because as a customer and for this huge inconvience they should do something!

Apparently, they came around 12:30 and didn't even call back until the next day only to complain that they were not even able to finish the job because they were so overwhelmed by having to clean a prior job and felt that it was too much to clean our apartment. They complained that it was too much to clean the refridgerator, oven and bathrooms. Now when you do a move out clean, that is about all there is to do, other than cleaning the windows and such. Basically Ms. DAWN CSERNAI was rude and very unprofessional but not completing the job she and her crew were initially hired to do on Monday in which she had us waiting 6 hrs only to tell us that she couldn't do it on Tuesday and then to call us on Wednesday to say that the job was too difficult.

I would give negative stars if I could, worse than zero. I would pay not to come here again.Arrive and guy at front counter asks 'what do you want?' Obviously, food. Why else would I be here? I am asked 'Do you want a sandwich or soup?' Well I dont know. Could I sit down and see a menu, please? He sits us down and tells us they ran out of beef pho but they still have turmeric noodles. Since my guest and I have no other soup choices, we both order that dish.Table of six people walk in less than 5 minutes later. One person obviously has been here or knows the people. Waiter guy states they have beef pho but ran out of turmeric noodles. What? Just said the opposite to me. They then produce 6 bowls of beef pho, 2 more bowls for their own workers, and even fill extra to-go orders for that same table.Dont go telling me that youre out of something when you offer it to another six customers right after me. Sure, you might know them. But how does that make you appear to other customers who are in the restaurant that werent given the option to order that dish because you claimed you were out?Cherry on top after all of this: $15 minimum for credit cards and debit cards.Bottom line: Again, absolutely cannot support a restaurant that provides generally poor customer service like rude waiter(s) or blatantly lies/cant treat customers equally.

I couldnt bare to walk on the carpet barefoot,  It was so bad I laid a path of towels down to walk throughout the suite.  The plumbing was broken in the shower.  We reported it and asked if they could have it repaired while we were the parks, but we requested no maid room service.  The attendant not only was rude about it, he flat said NO we cant go in the room if you have the do not disturb sign on the door. We said ' well cant you make a note and document that we, as the guest, request no room service? Because we need plumbing repairs in the room? ' He said No.  At that point we had received such horrible service already my husband just told the man fine this is typical for the service we have received this entire stay at this hotel.  We proceeded to leave the hotel for the parks, Obviously upset and youd think the guy would reconsider and try to make it right, but no he let us walk right out knowing we have a plumbing issue that needed repair.  The issue was that the shower faucet flew off the wall while I was showing and hit my leg. That night and next day we had to shower in the tub with water shooting straight out of the wall from a copper pipe.  The shower head did not work.  We will make do as this will be our last night of a seven night. We missed breakfast.  I called room service for a pot of coffee.  I wait 30 it does not show up.  So i call to check on it.  Tondra who is very sweet said she has not record of room service.  She took my order for a pot of coffee and 15 minutes later I get coffee.  Five minutes after I get another knock at the door and its Tondra with coffee.  I tell her they just came.  She said how much did they charge you.  I told her it was 9.00.  She said it came from the hotel next door which buena vista also owns and that it why it took so long she said they should have told me.  They didnt .  Tondra assures me I will not get charged twice.  Tondra and Carlos were the only good things about this hotel.  There are so many hotels near Disney you have many choices.

I am very pleased with my experience and the level of service. They reported that the brakes were at 6-70% but, as I already suspected, it needed a full strut/shock job at 4 corners. The avg for such is $175-250 a corner, and with all the promotions from them and the manufacturer, I ended up with labor, tax, etc at about $182 a corner, so it felt like a great deal. They were quick and communicated well. Lastly, they forgot the LOF, and were apologetic, but not a problem, we had some time before it was needed. However, thanks to Chris who followed up with a call and a generous offer to LOF for free. Also he mailed some 10% coupons. I'll be back, and appreciate the customer service, which really defines the experience. Let's face it, anyone can do an LOF. It is the service that makes me return. Thanks!",
