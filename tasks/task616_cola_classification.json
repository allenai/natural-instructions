    "Definition": "You're given a sentence and your task is to classify whether the sentence is acceptable or not. Any sentence which is grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker and which minimizes superfluous content is acceptable, otherwise unacceptable. If the sentence is acceptable then write \"acceptable\", otherwise \"unacceptable\".",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Our friends won't buy this analysis, let alone the next one we propose.",
            "output": "acceptable",
            "explanation": "The sentence is easy to understand where a person talks about not being convinced of the analysis. So, it's acceptable."

            "output": "acceptable",

            "input": "The dog barked out of the room.",
            "output": "unacceptable",
            "explanation": "The sentence makes no sense. So it must be unacceptable because the a dog barking and getting out of room have no correlation."
