    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you're given a statement, the genre to which that statement belongs, and a label indicating if the statement should be agreed with (entailment), disagreed with (contradiction), or neither (neutral). Your job is to write a sentence that describes the genre that follows the tone with respect to the statement, as indicated by the label. If sentence X agrees with sentence Y, the can be concluded from one another. If sentence X disagrees with sentence Y, they can not be correct at the same time. The sentence must also belong to the genre specified."

            "output": "The candy has many fans who love its attractions.",
            "explanation": "When the given label is neutral, it means that you should write a sentence that neither agrees with the statement, nor disagrees with it.  We don't know if the candy has many fans, hence the sentence is neutral. The places are specifically pointed out and referred to as attractions, so the given sentence is in the same genre."

        {
            "input": "Statement: I've forgotten his name now, confessed Tuppence.\nLabel: neutral.\nGenre: fiction.",
            "output": "Tuppence remembered his name later.",
            "explanation": "Both sentences describe the actions of a character and hence are in the genre fiction. Tuppence may or may not remember the name later, hence the sentence is neutral (neither agrees with the statement, nor disagrees with it)."

            "input": "Statement: One of the first organizational realignments taking place is in the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate.\nLabel: entailment.\nGenre: government.",
            "output": "The office of the taxpayer advocate is having an organizational realignment.",
            "explanation": "The label is entailment, so the answer should agree with the given statement. The given sentence clearly agrees with the statement, so it is a correct answer. Also, both sentences refer to the reorganization of an official department, hence the genre is government."

            "explanation": "The sentences seem to be part of a dialogue, hence the genre is telephone. The shoes are definitely over a hundred dollars, so the sentence correctly disagrees with the given statement."

            "explanation": "The sentences sound like they are part of a government survey report, hence the genre is government. However, it is not known if 0.25 of all households was considered a large number at the time, so the given sentence doesn't agree with the statement."

            "explanation": "It is not clear how many people were seen by Dr. Famous, so the sentence neither agrees with the statement, nor disagrees with it. However, the statistics given in the sentence sound like they belong in a government survey and hence the genre is not fiction."
