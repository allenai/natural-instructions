    "Definition": "In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \"because\". You should decide whether the first sentence can be the result of the second sentence. If you can see a possible cause and effect relationship, answer with \"plausible\", otherwise answer with \"not plausible\".",

            "input": "The woman went to the bank because pigs can fly.",
