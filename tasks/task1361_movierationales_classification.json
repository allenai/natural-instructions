it 's kruger 's \" style \" , not the director 's that winds up on screen .\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" .\nand his numerous twists ca n't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd 's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan\nj .\npakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they should n't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" .\n. .\ngrammar be damned ) .\n\"\nhow did you know that ?\n\" the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . . . since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger 's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it 's no wonder why he works so frequently .\nhe 's quickly becoming miramax 's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr .\nvehicles .\ntheir company 's current logo could be\n\"\nwe ride the trends \" . reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it 's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone 's bitch .\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting .\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who 's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) james frain is nick , rudy 's cellmate , a manslaughterer who 's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she 's never seen one picture of him .\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near - riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley 's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co - horts .\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i 've described might as well be irrelevant .\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack\na stupid one - liner .\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .\nthough it 's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a - list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin\n( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr .\nmorneau ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make - up and a not so flattering moo - moo ) , and now this .\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain - zapped mtv audience to pick apart .\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes )\nserve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol\n( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance\n( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .",

induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms .\nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states .\nmeanwhile , tatopoulos 's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big - time news reporter .\nshe 'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break .\nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey 's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place .\ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla .\nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation 's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla .\nhe did n't .\nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history .\nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur - like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it 's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down .\nthe script , however , is painfully bad .\nit 's fraught with lines\nso corny , they do n't even belong in b - movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl .\n\"\ni suppose when you 've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well .\nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ?\nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ?\nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ?\nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter - bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ?\nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit - picky ,\nbut hey , i was on a roll .\nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he 's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way .\nhank azaria does what he can , but do n't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage .\nlike broderick 's , azaria 's character is quite simply lacking in color .\nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .\ncasting must have been asleep on this one .\nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we 've seem him do in the past .\nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable .\nunfortunately , the same can not be said of the other incongruities .\nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue - in - cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it .\nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess .\nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .\nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? if we ca n't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply do n't care what happens to them .\ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light - hearted than it should be .\nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here 's a behemoth running through the city !\nthere 's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after - school g .\ni .\njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm 's way just in time .\nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire .\nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers .\nit 's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . consider another punch pulled .\nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one does n't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently .\nit made me want to gag .\nemmerich should have done away with 9N % of the humor and in - jokes and played this one as a straight action film .\nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add - ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just does n't work .\nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . .",

up hack performing as a studio puppet for 2Nth century fox and universal pictures .\nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps .\nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places .\nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time .\njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) .\nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers .\nwith some convoluted mumbo -

collar job , is sexually inadequate , and can not communicate with his family about his feelings .\nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone .\nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood .\nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to .\nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy .\nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct .\nand you got the feeling that these crass people could n't act like this all the time .\nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic .\nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story .\nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line .\neven the best effects ca n't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days .\nnow that i think about it ,\nthe worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make .\npeople will be lined up around the block for it .\nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2NN2 .\neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he 'll play every character in the movie .\ni just ca n't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .",

)\nwith the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country .\neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so\nwhat probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war .\nthe film 's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 4N years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never .\nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether .\nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle - aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide .\nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined .\nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 3NN year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage .\nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband 's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless .\nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) .\nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her .\neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures .\nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use .\nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high - quality stuff .\nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) .\nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed :\nthe police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace 's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you ca n't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation .\nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big - time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and does n't want matthew to end up in jail .\nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail .\nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity .\nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity .\nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood .\nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded .\nthis ' unhip ' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something\nnaughty middle - aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .\nummm !",

disaster to be released the beginning of july .\nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante 's peak .\nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .\napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . to be completely honest , i have n't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .\nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .\ndeep impact does n't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .\nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .\ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .\na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .\namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) .\nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .\nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident .\na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again .\nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc .\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover - up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) .\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie .\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help .\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . .\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road .\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) .\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .\nand so , yada yada yada\n, they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival .\na computer will select 8NN , NNN people at random .\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wo n't kill off the entire human race .\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer -- approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .\nit 's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it wo n't work .\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er .\n\" her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .\nsuggestion to ms .\nleder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off\n.\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real - time --\nit 's that boring\n.\nof course , leder is n't all to blame for it .\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .\nchock full of cheesy one liners\n( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) and\nstupid characters\n, you might think we were back in the 7Ns again .\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring\n.\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you ca n't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci - fi .\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .\nthat 's right , 8N % miss , and 2N % hit .\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that 's forgiveable .\nwhat is n't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .\ngive me a break , will ya ?\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks\n.\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .\njust when we think visual effects ca n't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder 's direction , which also influences the actors .\nleder loves to show the actors ' faces before and during moments of terror .\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .\nleder likes to flaunt people 's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space .\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person 's face while drifting into space .\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .\non another note , leder 's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it 's obvious it will be emotional .\nit 's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it did n't work for me .\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .\nt ?\na leoni ( bad boys , tv 's \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .\nher character is made stronger by leoni 's presence , and we grow to care for her .\nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .\nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still has n't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !\nyou are too talented for this stuff ) .\nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .\nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .\nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .\nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .\na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .\neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .\ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv 's \" star trek : the next generation .\n\" seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .\noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .\ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .\nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .\nluckily , the x - files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .\nit 's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just is n't worth much .\ncosting nearly $ 75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar - winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .\nwell , it 's not .\nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .",

watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b - movie is quickly answered .\nmr .\nbrancato 's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches .\nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there 's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious .\nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker 's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here .\n\"\nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful .\n\"\nand she 's not even empathic !\nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully - paced suspense sequence , eve , who 's telepathically linked to her alien / human - hybrid counterpart\n( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien - hunting protagonists , \" he 's going to rape her .\n\" while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .\nthere 's an amusing , tongue - in - cheek bit of product placement ( which does n't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket - related hijinx ( \" he 's in aisle 1 !\n\" informs eve ) .\nif the film maintained this sort of light - hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects - ladened anticlimactic conclusion .\nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it 's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief .\nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve 's brain ?\nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ?\nmy favourite was the slow - motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks .\nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it 's being foisted upon the public .\nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms .\nhelgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay ,\nbut there 's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis .\nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble )\nchurns out an all - too - familiar spin on a generic brash - mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick 's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film .\nmr .\nlazard gives his character an appropriately shifty - eyed look , while returning vixen ms .\nhenstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) .\nms .\nhenstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she 's so empowered .\n\"\na lethal half - alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion\n-- now * that 's\n* what i call empowerment .",

august dumping ground .\nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .\nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .\nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .\nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .\nthe film i saw today did n't even meet those expectations .\nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess .\ni would slam it harder , if it were n't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors .\nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .\nthat 's the main problem with the avengers : for all it 's hip - hop flash and tidal waves ,\nnone of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .\nit 's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .\nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 9N minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .\nthis is just plain depressing .\nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 6Ns television show .\nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i 've never watched an episode .\ni was n't alive then .\ni do n't even watch television now .\ni 'm very sorry that i do n't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i 've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse .\ni did n't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .\ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .\nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr .\npeel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .\nthey are to work together , under mother 's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co - conspirator , father , is played by the equally - talented fiona shaw ) .\nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .\nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) .\nhe is a crazy scottish guy .\nour heroes had better stop him , or else . . .\nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film 's few funny lines ) . along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense\n.\nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .\nnow , killer bugs do n't really go with the weather - controlling theme of the film .\nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .\nthey 're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they 're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .\nthe special effects are n't bad , but they 're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .\nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .\nand i guarantee you ,\nit will wane .\ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it did n't do any good to think .\nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re - assembled so many times that even the people involved could n't tell us what happens .\nthere are several scenes in the preview that did n't make the final cut .\nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low - budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .\nthe scenes that do n't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .\nthey are n't .\nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film .\nthey are n't , either .\nand what about this\nwasted cast ?\noh , it makes me weep with disappointment .\nwe 're talking ralph fiennes here ,\none of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * .\ni love the guy .\ni 've loved all his films , until this one .\nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he 's as lost as we are .\nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , ca n't manage to look at home here .\n( i do n't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it ca n't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )\nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .\nwho is to blame ? is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?\nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .\nis it the actors ?\nfor god 's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .\ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who should n't have been given the task to begin with .\nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .\nadd to that a lack of experience in big - budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .\nif the avengers has a saving grace , it 's the set design .\nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .\ni like the final set - piece , on de wynter 's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense .\ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr .\npeel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .\ni also enjoyed michael kamen 's music score , particularly in the opening credits .\nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but\nthere 's a lot more that needs to be here .\ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .\nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . or a sense of purpose .\nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles .\ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance .",

while bruno may have studied under cameron 's wing for years and years , i 'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him .\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ;\nthe fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z - grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z - grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .\nthe film seems to not only borrow it 's plot from last year 's similarly - fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b - movie from the ' 8Ns called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter 's twisted remake of \" the thing .\n\" \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water .\nthey get on .\nthey break up into pairs and investigate .\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) .\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond - ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential - romantic - interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper .\nand it 's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus - side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just do n't give a damn .\ni almost do n't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub - par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he 's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance - of - which - he - should - be - ashamed\n.\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo 'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) .\nor peter o'toole in \" caligula .\n\" great actor , horrific performance .\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland 's career that\nno one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film .\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone 's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar - nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it 's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . .\nif , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them .\n\" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it 's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable .\n\"\nand if you do n't believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there 's even one shot where we see godzilla\neither a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him\n( well , you do n't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) .\nbut all of this does n't matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie .\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i 've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean - extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure could n't figure it out when i saw it ) .\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that 's basically the whole of \" virus \" :\none horribly - directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget\nthat saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members .\nand my god , it 's a long damn sit .\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it 's a wonder that it even got made .\nwe already know that big movie studios ' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool .\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light .\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face .\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i 'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr .\nbruno for making a movie that could be this bad .\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" are not only justifiable , but encouraged .",

'\n\" then there 's the tone of the movie .\nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .\nthen it could be an adventure movie .\nthey 're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) was n't a good enough actor to carry it off .\nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .\njust because a movie is tame enough for kids does n't mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who 's the center of a family .\nmany quality family films have been made with a non - traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .\nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .\nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys .\nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .\nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .\nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .\nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism .\nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2N56 .\nwhy ?\nwhy bother saying what year this is .\njust tell us it 's the future .\ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .\nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it wo n't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .\nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .\nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny 's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers have n't learned a thing about ergonomics .\none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .\nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .\nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .\nbut if that 's the best part of the movie , i ca n't in good conscience recommend it .\nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards .",

            "input": "capsule :\nthe much anticipated re - adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver 's travels and treat it as an action film .\nthat makes it a film without much center . , N ( -4 to +4 )\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver 's travels .\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift 's island of the houyhnhnms .\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling - ish .\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history .\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series .\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non - ape - speaking .\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .\nbut serling never tackles the all - important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith 's best if not his best .\nwhen the film 's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well - intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 196Ns and 197Ns .\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton 's new version is even less faithful .\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .\nin 2N29 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world 's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard - of - oz - fashion and drops him on an alien planet .\n( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .\nand the language they talk is earth- english .\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently did n't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human - animal relationships and more one of the master - slave relationships .\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .\nshe is bent on making the world a better place .\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil - ari .\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material .\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each 's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .\nwe can not see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i did n't like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup .\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 .\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw - dropper .\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker 's visualization is really an improvement .\nthese visuals work nicely .\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .\napes spring incredible distances .\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air\nthe effect is lost .\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close - up . since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make - up .\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .\nbut he delivers them very well .\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .\nas the ape - trader limbo he over - emotes to overcome his ape make - up , but does it very well .\nin doing\nso he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov 's performance in spartacus .\nas an in - joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .\ndanny elfman 's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith 's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2NN1 film is forgotten .\ni rate the remake 4 on the N to 1N scale and a N on the -4 to +4 scale .",

year - old boy is autistic .\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it .\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him .\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising .\n\"\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon 's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost .\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he 's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people .\nit 's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he is n't playing like he 's autistic .\nunlike dustin hoffman 's performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio 's in \" what 's eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting .\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character 's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid .\nhell , he does n't even have to be shy .\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis ' arm .\nwillis ' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything .\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon 's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide .\nof course , we know that is n't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square - jawed government hitman with a mean - looking crew - cut knock off the parents .\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked .\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon .\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon 's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes .\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop .\nof all the hard - to - believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst .\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey 's character is far too accommodating .\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent .\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point .\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" does n't rise to the challenge .\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and\n3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were .\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it 's more suspenseful that way .\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor .\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious .\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts .\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it 's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .",

dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner 's . as an example of this film 's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that 's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum .\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature .\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to .\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .\nchildren are not muppets . and spawn unapologetically targets children .",

consequently , so was the film .\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane 's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness ,\nan idealistic do - gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .\nthis tacked - on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .\nthey fail on both counts .\nultimately , _ 54\n_ 's failure comes down to three letters : f - u - n . as in , there is n't any to be had for the audience .\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment does n't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film 's conclusion\n( one of the last - minute reshoots ) . strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there -- two of them , in fact --\nbut _ 54 _ is not one of them .\nthey 're on cable tv :\na couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings - on within it show that there 's still a great disco movie to be made .\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _ 54 _ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .",

gebrecht ) and her self - absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) .\nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst .\nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin .\nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but ca n't locate them now due to all the changes in the city .\nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents ' apartment building , mr .\napfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about .\nthe hasidics are ultra - orthodox : they do n't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws .\nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs .\nkalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year - old named simcha ( monty ) who does n't talk .\nthe stern mr .\nkalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .\nto hammer home the point of how anti - semitism has n't gone away\nthere 's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator .\nthe film is done in by its ham - fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman 's book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .\nit starts off telling chaja 's story of how she 's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that ca n't be forgotten .\nthe effort seemed heavy - handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters .\nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring\n: chaja 's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one - dimensional and falsely acted .\nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith .\ntopol 's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .\nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it ca n't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja 's loving care he 's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying ' quack , quack ' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder .\nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy 's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done\n.\ni felt i did n't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 1NN minutes of this serious but unappetizing story .\nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily -- the message it keeps sending was already received .\nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past .\nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . unless i was mistaken and the film 's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .",

michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second .\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator .\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator 's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves .\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator 's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave .\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film .\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on .\nmore time needed to be spent on white 's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings .\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over - the - top , obnoxious , evil general wynn .\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it 's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ;

protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others .\n\"\n54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that 's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it .\nthis is a definite plus .\nhere 's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 8Ns when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening .\nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let 's look at how it all affected the people .\nbut this film does n't let that happen .\nit gives us a half - assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who 's\nchief character trait is the fact that he 's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) .\nhe 's dim - witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he 's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars .\n. .\na bit like \" saturday night fever , \" ' cept no travolta and no real interest put into him .\npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but\nall he is a half - assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been .\nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame .\nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that 's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film\n.\nthe film 's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all - too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) .\nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that .\nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who 've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails .\nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he 's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much .\nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .\nit 's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route .\nthe studio 's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough .\nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film 's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini 's \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i did n't particularly want to stay .",

' in actuality , he 's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it 's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) .\nafter seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else .\no'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured ` the bachelor ' , and are hunting him down for revenge .",

boiled tarantino - esque dialogue .\nthey evince little chemistry , with rock\nconstantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that 's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) .\ni think rock is a great comic\nyet he has n't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it 's like he 's doing the damn chris rock show .\nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks .\nthat wide - open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty - year - old body .\nit 's the best work she 's ever done .\nfreeman is effective as always , though\nhis performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it .\nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty 's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality .\nthat 's interesting but the movie does n't do anything with it other than\ncrash land the sub - theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle .\nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie 's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it 's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing\n.\nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if\nit falls as flat as diet coke .\nbetty 's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty would n't make any progress in the film .\nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim 's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim 's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ?\na little too tidy , don'tcha think .\nbetty has an interesting theme , though it does n't even seem aware of this .\nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way .\nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real - life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) .\ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the ' 8Ns than the ' NNs ) , the film simply uses betty 's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b .\nno progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .",

he 's working from an atrocious script .\nonly during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in \" 2NN1 \" ) where the rescue team 's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does \" mission to mars \" come to life .\na scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger / more danger / attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it 's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes .\ntake it out , and the plot is n't affected in any way .\nthe sequence also suffers from a few plot holes\n( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship 's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , \" 2NN1 \" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ?\nwhy did tim robbins ' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ?\nshould n't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ?\nwhy are the characters such idiots ?\nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them .\nall the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it 's too bad you ca n't go on this mission because you were determined ' psychologically inadequate ' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together\n\" -- does anyone really talk like this ?\nca n't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ?\nthe whole film is like that .\nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what 's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we 're looking at * every * time .\nsample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut\na : \" look , there 's mars \" astronaut b :\n\" you sure that 's mars ?\n\" astronaut a :\n\" yeah , that 's mars all right .\n\" astronaut c :\n\" hey , are you guys looking at mars ?\n\" that exchange is n't actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i would n't be surprised if it were .\nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film have n't learned to do something all those directors did very well :\nshow and do n't tell .\nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten .\nthis is mentally - challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience wo n't get what 's going on , so they explain everything five times over .\nfourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted .\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i 'm just here to get a paycheck \" attitude .\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines .\narmin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo .\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . and sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - less - than - three - movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then .\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2NN1 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world .\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going .\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters .\nsupposedly we 're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one - character - decides - not - to - return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning .\nme , i alternated between the two .\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars\n\" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .",

the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from \" dawson 's creek \" ) , who 's chief personality\ntrait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from \" the man without a face \" ) , who 's the most interesting because he 's the only character who 's given some dimension .\nin the film 's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one 's fetishes and hang - ups , and it 's the best scene in the movie because it 's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film is n't .\ngavin suspects there 's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he 's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff .\nhere , we have another case of \" the idiot plot , \" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor .\nthe only other half - interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . .\nbut really , we do n't care anyway .\ni probably should n't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who 's works for \" the x - files , \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation .\nlike the show , he 's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel .\nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works .\nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff .\nhe keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just do n't get the hell out of there .\ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there 's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom .\nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier .\nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain .\nif he 's so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who could n't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ?\nthe film , which runs about 8N or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy .\nat such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it 's pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one 's mouth , especially mine .",

full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot\n.\nit 's easy to watch meet\njoe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani ,\nbut it 's even easier to sleep right through it\n( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .\n( it 's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )\nit should n't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr .\npitt .\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing - room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see\nmeet joe black immediately .\nanyway , the deceased lawyer 's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .\nif this were n't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is ,\nwe get scene after scene of fish - out - of - water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who 's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and does n't know how to act in our society .\nit also does n't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .\nand as played by brad pitt , he 's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing\n, he 's just there .\nit 's as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty .\n\"\nit 's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .\ni 've used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt 's performance with this year 's best angel performance , nicolas cage 's in city of angels .\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co - star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani 's character is so shallow that she ca n't see beyond pitt 's good looks .\nthe movie 's other top name is a much better actor , but that does n't save meet joe black .\nsir anthony hopkins is n't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .\nhe plays one of these good - hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .\n( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins 's character more realistically evil . )\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i 'm sure .\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i 'm asking myself why .\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i 'm going to do now .\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .\ndo n't go see\nmeet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .\n-- curtis edmonds \" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .\n\"\n-- sideshow bob",
