    "Definition": [
        "In this task you are given a list of triplets of the form [subject, predicate, object] and the output should be a question based on the triplets but with the subject and/or object replaced with blanks (represented using two or more consecutive underscores). Triplet values encompassed in [*] are special tokens that can be replaced with synonyms. The objective is to construct a question in a manner that (a) captures the facts specified in at least one of the triplets, and (b) ideally contains a limited number of blanks such that it is a well-formed question that is easy to answer. A blank can represent a single word or a phrase."
