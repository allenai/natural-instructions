    "Definition": [
        "This task is about using the specified Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets consisting of [subject, predicate, object] and converting them to a valid fill-the-slots question that utilizes one or more of these triplets. Triplet values encompassed in [*] are special tokens useful that can be replaced with synonyms. The objective is to construct a question in a manner that (a) captures the facts specified in at least one of the RDF triplets, and (b) ideally contains a limited number of slots such that it is a well-formed question that is easy to answer. A slot can represent a single word or a phrase. The input is a list of triplets of the form [subject, predicate, object] and the output is a question based on the triplets but with the subject and/or object replaced with slots (represented using two or more consecutive underscores)."
