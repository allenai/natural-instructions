    "Definition": "In this task, you're give the beginning and the ending of an incomplete three-part story. Your job is to complete the short story by writing a probable middle of the story that explains why the ending follows after the beginning and justify the created middle by describing the central message/theme of the story. Input sentences must be short, have fewer than 10 words, and be simple as if narrating to a child. Avoid using any irrelevant extra information when creating the middle, and use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. The central message must be expressed as a general rule of thumb. For example: people don't like wearing soiled clothes.",
