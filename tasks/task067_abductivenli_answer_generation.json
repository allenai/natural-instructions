        "In this task, you're given the beginning and the ending of a three-part story. Your job is to complete the short story by writing a middle sentence that seamlessly connects  the first and last sentence. Generated sentences must be short, have fewer than 10 words, and be simple as if narrating to a child. Avoid using any irrelevant extra information when creating the middle sentence, and use names (e.g. Jack, Barbara,...) instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible."
