    "Definition": "In this task, you're give the middle and ending of an incomplete three-part story. Your job is to complete the short story by writing a probable beginning of the story that explains why the middle and ending follow, and justify the created beginning by describing the central message/theme of the story. Input sentences must be short, have fewer than 10 words, and be simple as if narrating to a child. Avoid using any irrelevant extra information when creating the beginning, and use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. The central message must be expressed as a general rule of thumb. For example: people don't like wearing soiled clothes.",
