I contacted the seller again and they apologized and sent me a replacement, again assuring me that I was getting bath bombs with Pokemon toys. Again, same weird cat toy, one had a Pokemon, and the last another weird cat toy in another color. I contacted them again and explained that I wanted to have a chance to make the situation right before I left a review. After a few days I received a reply of now they need my address and phone number to send me a new one. At this point I just wanted them to acknowledge their mistake and fix their posting because it is misleading.

A week later I got an email from them saying something along the lines of \"We're not going to replace the hard drive because when we received it, we observed a small dent on the outside which voids your warranty, have a nice day.\" It was completely fine before shipping and adequately protected, I wouldn't put it past them to have made the dent themselves. Unfortunately I didn't have photographic evidence to dispute so I angrily purchased a replacement. Fast forward a few months, when everything on my PC starts to lag like crazy. Take it into a shop for a diagnostic and behold, the DVI port for the graphics card has gone bad. I'm currently stuck in RMA hell with them trying to get that replaced as well. I've had to physically print out multiple forms and go through several departments trying to get them to accept my return. All I can say is that I am never purchasing anything from this retailer ever again. TLDR: Cheap parts, multiple things broken, poor service, all around overpriced. Look elsewhere and stay away from CyberpowerPC. \n Summary: Cheap parts, bad service, never ordering from Cyberpower again",

The back side has a flathead screwdriver slot, but the front end is just a smooth surface (ostensibly to eliminate any friction when buckling). However, since there is no way to grip the smooth front side, it’s impossible to break the glue lock and unscrew the pieces without damaging the belt. The comments tell you to grip the smooth front end with needle-nose pliers and then warns you to be careful not to damage the belt. But since that part is flush with the belt surface, the only way to grip it with needle-nose pliers is to dig into the leather to get the pliers around it. Some damage is almost assured if you do this. Poor design on an otherwise high quality belt. They could easily make the smooth front end with a flathead screwdriver slot just deep enough to get purchase to crack the glue. Then you'd just need two screwdrivers and no damage would occur.

Now for the bad it has tons of bugs. I've been really frustrated with the unit because I wanted to mount it out of sight. I placed it under my dash and used the extension cable. Okay that worked great until I tried to use it. Every time I hooked it up and tried to transmit it would just beep. On other cb's it would have a pulse noise. So I could receive great but can't transmit. If I don't use the extension cable it works but the cord is soooo short. I have tried 3 cables and they all do it. I wish uniden actually had good customer service to help. So the fact is if you only use the unit without the extension cable it is good. I'm very disappointed 😞 \n Summary: Receives well but does not transmit. Great in concept but not in reality",

It also appears that one of the ribbon cables was already damaged and attempted to be fixed by being painted over by a Sharpie. Severely disappointed with the quality control of this screen. Full Review: Once I had received this iPhone 6 Replacement Screen, I promptly went to install it on my old cracked iPhone 6. I placed all the ribbon connectors in the correct place, screwed back on the protector plates and attempted to turn the phone on, and all that greeted me was a black screen instead of the Apple Logo. After looking further into it, it seems as though the backlight turns on, but the display doesn't turn on, and attempting to reinstall this occasionally shows the boot-up sequence normally, but attempting to screw back on the protector plates with screws and turning on the phone ends up with the same issue - Backlight turns on but the Display doesn't. Even then, when the display does turn on when the phone boots up, if I was to put the phone to sleep (locking it) and attempting to wake it up just greets me with the black screen again. I tested the connectors on the board with the old, cracked screen and the display still seems to come on 100% of the time, being usable still despite being cracked, and doesn't go to a black screen when attempting to wake it out of sleep mode or attempting to unlock it (or turning it on). After looking closer on the ribbon cables on the screen itself, it looks as though some of the ribbon cables have been shipped already being damaged. What's even more absurd is that the damage on the ribbon cables seems to have been covered by a permanent marker, leaving a shine as you can see on one of the pictures. Provided are also 2 more pictures, the one with the bluish tint on screen is when the screen is \"on,\" only showing the backlight turns on but the display doesn't. The other picture shows when the screen is off, for comparison. Severely disappointed in this product, will definitely be sending it back and asking for a refund. \n Summary: iPhone 6 Screen - Backlight turns on but Display does not.",

Had to file a claim with Amazon, who, fortunately, is working to assist and make it right. TL; DR: Seller sent a COMPLETELY different item than ordered, the tried to charge me to package/send said 7-8 foot item back to them in order to get a refund. My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake. I strongly caution you against buying anything from this company. \n Summary: Seller sent COMPLETELY different item, then tried to charge me to package/sent 7-8 foot item back.",

I determined the cause to be a necessary software update, which then wouldn't process due to an incompatibility with a new version of iOS. Two weeks later, I got my mug updated and got to use it. My first experience was putting coffee into the mug, lid closed. I kept the liquid under the \"Fill Line\" as instructed, and when my drink reached temperature and I went to open it to drink, the lid \"popped\" violently, and sprayed liquid everywhere. If you travel with this lid and use it in the closed position, expect to have to force the lid open and have liquid spray out in all directions. It's not a rare occurrence with regular use. The experience, upon using the mug, was nothing exceptional. It would keep drinks warm for about two hours, set to a specific temperature. But, unless it's plugged into its charging pad, I've found it will occasionally \"forget\" to keep the drink warm. I'll tap the logo, the mug will light up and inform me my drink has dropped twenty degrees from where I had it set, and it has to try to warm it up. Not quite the experience I expected, but it's not a major issue. Then, the lid broke. The lid is a ring in the center of the mug, and you have to depress it, where it latches and stays open to allow you to drink. My lid broke such that the lid would no longer latch into place, and would rock off to one side or the other, so that I could either get no liquid out at all, if the lid were centered, or I could get a sporadic and slow trickle of liquid out by getting the lid stuck inside itself. I contacted them and was summarily shipped a replacement lid, and I thought perhaps it would be a fluke. I got the lid, and continued as normal. In this time, the mug would often (probably 8 times out of 10) refuse to turn on without first being touched to the charger. Again, not a great experience for a $150 coffee mug. Then, just now, my second lid broke. I'm going to have to contact customer support again, and see if they'll ship me another lid. All this has occurred since September 2017, a five-month period. Not the level of quality I would presume to get from such an expensive luxury product, but I'll have to consider this a lesson learned. I had high hopes for this product, but it would seem the Kickstarter Curse is as present as ever. It has been a considerable waste of money, energy, and time, and I do not recommend anyone buy this product, or any other product from Ember. \n Summary: Lids will break, mug doesn't always work as you would think",

The little mask is for a toddler so it was way too small for my 13 year old and the large mask was so big that part of the mask was almost touching his eyes. It served its purpose but it was annoying to readjust constantly. The manufacturer should really make some adjustments on this mask. Tubing was sturdy and no problem. Chamber that holds medication was easy to clean. The masks need to be changed. The connection from the mask to the nebulizer needs to have a tighter fit and not be so easy to disconnect and the mask itself has sizing issues. I will not be purchasing this again I am sorry to say. \n Summary: Mask needs to be redesigned and connection tighter.",

I emailed Suncast and have yet to hear a response after over 2 months so that was not a mark in their favor either.

The wheels will catch debris, and unless they are maintained consistently, will end up scratching the flood. 2. The wheels only have one point of contact with the floor, while traditional casters have two. While this decreases friction and helps them move easier, it could leave indentations in some flooring surfaces. 3. When moving while seated, the wheels can bind when changing directions, which was annoying. 4. This last issue seems a little silly, but these wheels move too well. I found myself gliding away from my desk unless I had my feet firmly planted on the floor. So, unless you are interested in some racing wheels for your office chair (which these would be fantastic for), I can't recommend them as a substitute for a good chair mat. \n Summary: Why did the color change when I only carry it in my bag?",

Was on phone with customer service for an hour having to literally ARGUE with an agent -- who refused for a long time to transfer me to a supervisor -- and then with a supervisor. After all that, no resolution. All they offered to do was pick up the machine and send it for repairs...but we'd have to stay home, waiting for pick-up, for a 2-3 day period -- which could not even be scheduled for a particular week. (We're leaving for vacation in a couple of days.) Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee. I've cleaned and re-settled all the external parts every way I can think of, to no avail. I'd expect better of a machine that cost half of much.

The neckline should be adjustable 2) it doesn’t seem all that strong. I did see some reviews prior to purchasing about the harness getting damaged by the dog pulling but I still wanted to see for myself. My dog doesn’t pull often but when he does I’m sure that this harness would not hold up. He’d definitely tear it apart My neighbors also have a pitbull but he is a lot smaller than mine so I gave the harness to them.

I don't think the snaps that keep the cups in place will last anytime at all and omg the smell! I have gotten things from China in the past that smell just like this, like diesel fuel. Unfortunately in my experience this doesn't go away as it is a chemical compound used in the making of the item. I tried using my very good smelling leather milk cleaner, it worked for a few minutes and then once the cleaner was dry it once again smelled like diesel. I will keep it since the flask and cups work as I want them to and two collapsible cups allows for a dirty and a clean paint water but I am disappointed in both the quality and most of all the smell of this item so I wouldn't buy it again. \n Summary: Worse quality then what I've purchased at the Dollar Tree",

And I am inclined to believe that. They come with a leather (possibly real) carrying bag, a comically long straight cord, and an annoyingly sized spiral cord. The spiral cord went down to my knees with my music player in my pocket, making it not ideal for commuting. I purchased a much shorter cord for my commute for around $10. Very impressed overall. However, these broke on me after 3 and a half months of use. I took them off and SNAP, a piece of the hinge on my left side snapped, leaving wires exposed and the headphones unwearable (they still work). Throughout my ownership of these cans, whenever I moved the ear cups, there was a cracking sound, like the plastic was screaming for help. I thought that this was just an odd feature, but I now believe it to be a design or manufacturing flaw. I am unsure if Audio Technica and/or Amazon would cover this under a warranty or not. I do not have the budget to pay them to fix it, buy new headphones, or waste money shipping the headphones back and forth to possibly get a free repair done. So, I will probably have to do a crappy epoxy or tape job to fix these, as I absolutely cannot stand to listen to dollar store ear buds anymore. I bought these headphones not only because of the sound, but because I was led to believe that these were extremely durable headphones that would last me years to come. That is perfect, because I used these on my daily commute, brought them camping, took them halfway across the US with me, and I used them for practicing my instruments. But alas, they did not last, so I cannot recommend these headphones with their current build quality, unless you are to only use them at your desk. And at that point, you might as well buy more expensive, better sounding headphones (not that these sound bad, because they don't). I am impressed, but at the same time thoroughly disappointed in this product. I cannot recommend these to your average consumer.

I bought this as a first crossbow gift to my sister and purchased everything, the crossbow target block, extra lube wax, extra arrows and the Barnett crossbow case that came recommended to fit this model (which it did not and I am also returning, but this is a different issue all together). I contacted the seller and I got an email back saying their customer service is closed until Sunday because of Jewish Shabbat. So what am I supposed to give her as a gift now? The extra items I purchased to go with her crossbow, without the actual crossbow?! 'Happy birthday sister, I got you a crossbow, but it was missing items and I had to send it back, so here is the accessories to it.' Yeah, that's going to go over well. I don't often write bad reviews, but had I not checked it thoroughly and put it together myself (or at least tried to), I would have given her an item that could have seriously injured her because it was not bolted down properly from lack of missing items.

The one thing it has going for it is its appearance, and I don't think that's enough reason to deal with its shortcomings. The section with the stars pops out slightly and maybe there's a reason for that, but it ends up picking up additional gunk and is extremely difficult to clean, in part due to all the star cutouts. Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous. For the price of this band, you can do much better. The stars may make it unique (and I love almost everything with stars on it) but it doesn't make up for everything else. \n Summary: A massive disappointment with some misogyny added for good measure",

While on the surface the heroine has an \"in your face\" persona, behind that is just another big woman who doesn't like what she sees in the mirror and doesn't understand why the Hero would either. To Madam Butterfly: while BBW is something I don't enjoy, I do understand that for every reader who does not enjoy that genre, you must have twice that many asking for them. I appreciate you honestly labeling your novel BBW, it was my error thinking I could ignore the weight and size references. BTW, I also want to thank you for explaining how authors get paid on Amazon. Because of your thorough and honest accounting, I have changed to buying your books instead of renting them through my Kindle Unlimited account. You deserve to be paid for your talent.

            "input": "Reviews: Calling this game mediocre is generous. I bought this game primarily to play the multiplayer with friends, but played through the campaign to get a feel for the game. Graphics are okay, no better than par for the course at this point (Battlefield's are slightly better). Frequent display glitches where the top 25% of the screen would lag or break pretty consistently during cutscenes. Story is unimpressive and the overly aggressive CO gets old extremely quick. Gameplay was choppy at best, seems there's a cutscene or a change of perspective every time you start to build any momentum. The health pack system made the play very frustrating - most levels are played something like: pop two shots, find cover, use health pack, repeat. Simply not very satisfying completing the campaign. Multiplayer is as bad as others have described. If you have someone else living with you who does not appreciate you yelling at the screen constantly, for their sake, do not buy this game. Laggy, inconsistent, and frustrating. As I mentioned earlier, I bought the game to play multiplayer with friends. The party system is an absolute mess. It's nearly impossible to play with friends. First, you have to change default settings to join parties at all, and if you're lucky enough to successfully create or join a party, you're likely to end up in entirely different games. I'd estimate I've successfully played the same match as my friends no more than 20% of the time. Please save your money until these issues are fixed, I promise you it's not worth your time in the current state the game is in. \n Summary: Why is the passenger flag backwards on the window?",

Steps are clear...do not plug the battery in to the charger first. First you plug the charger into the wall. CHECK! Then when it is solid Red you plug the battery into the charger. CHECK! This is where it should blink green indicating its charging, but of course mine just stays solid red and doesn't do anything. It doesn't even recognize the battery is connected. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the battery to make sure the connection was tight and good. Tried the steps all over again on a different wall outlet....nothing. I've only used the remote control car maybe 6-7 times total and that was using the provided car charger to charge the battery. This thing has been nothing but a pain, and this charger did not do its job.

I have been exercising regularly for a few years now and I decided to treat myself to this item as a birthday present: BIG MISTAKE. When I work out, I exercise vigorously. I go to the gym to get a good, intense workout in and usually come out sweating. I do both cardio and weights, but this device runs into the most problems when it comes to cardio. The heart rate tracker literally cannot read through my sweat. Yes you read that correctly - A FITNESS TRACKER CANNOT READ YOUR HEART RATE THROUGH SWEAT. How ironic. My heart rate will jump (during intense, steady-state cardio) from 165 to 110 to a blank screen (as you can see in the photo attached) to 150, then 98, etc. I contacted Fitbit customer service and was sent a replacement device. It also didn't work. Then, they sent me a SECOND replacement device. It also fails to accurately track my fitness stats. Given that this is the third device that has failed to record my stats, it clearly is their technology that is faulty. They refuse to reimburse me for their faulty product. If you actually care about exercising and want to do so with anything more than moderate intensity, don't even waste your money on this device. I'd recommend spending the extra $100-$300 on a Polar Watch or Apple Watch to get a product that will actually work for years at a time. I am so incredibly disappointed with this product and the Fitbit customer service team who, despite acknowledging the problem with their faulty technology, refuses to correct the situation with me. \n Summary: DO NOT PURCHASE if you actually want to track fitness stats",

And it never fails that when they do they ruin it. (Maybe the issue is that what's \"broken\" is their profit margins.) I had been using this product for maybe 15 years with great success. When I ran out of my last jug, I came here to Amazon to buy another and saw there were some negative reviews about the smell. Since I always found the smell very pleasant, I wasn't sure why people were leaving these reviews; I thought maybe they just didn't like it. Then, I saw there was an \"old formula\" being sold. Figuring they made a change, I decided to play it safe and get the \"old\" one. I didn't receive the old formula. (The seller was \"Washington Blvd Sales\".) Instead, I received what I'm positive must be the new formula -- which is awful. It has a headache-inducing perfume, reminiscent of what I remember lice shampoo smelling like. Not only does it not deter my cats peeing in the same spot, it doesn't seem to get rid of the urine smell anymore. I made the mistake of not trying it on a surface before using it. In my defense, I bought the \"old formula\" and assumed it was the same product I've been purchasing for years. Well, I sprayed my couch with it and now it smells like pee and this dreadful perfume. Thanks, Spectrum Brands. Your \"new formula\" has wasted my money and possibly ruined my couch. :( \n Summary: Yet another manufacturer who has ruined an amazing product",

The entire tops of these shoe is a mesh type of material that breaths very well. No soo good when dealing with winter weather though. I love the slip on aspect of the shoe due to the nature of my work. However that backs of the shoe likes to bunch up when putting them on and it's not exactly easy to fix once your foot is in the shoe. You have to take measures to prevent that as your foot slides into the show. This is the reason behind my low rating of these shoes: First off the tread collects everything due to the small gaps in the tread. If you are out in the rain, snow, or mud you will carry that stuff on the bottom of your shoe for a very long time once you come in doors. Water doesn't even clean out very well. So tracking even water becomes an issue. These are also worthless in the snow or ice. Very slick and absolutely no traction. I fell at work due to this problem. Wet floors is even a problem. My biggest issue with these shoes is a manufacturer defect. There is some sort of seam right next to my big toe witch that had caused me to stop wearing the shoes. It hurts and causes me to walk in a way to try and avoid it. This causes a tremendous amount of pain in my feed by the end of the day.

We were scared. Though generator was off... it was leaking few drops where generator usually is. So, we moved 15 ft away and filled into a tall glass and noticed the leak again. We cleaned up carefully, moved further and now, other friends tried... same result. Open/close lid, check twice, try again, same result. We figured this is unusable... Gas leak is Hazardous... fumes themselves are highly flammable. Guess what, returns not accepted on this product because... Gas cans shipping has certain constraints. It is not as simple as put in same box and ship. Safety, liability constraints makes returns more expensive than product itself. When Amazon was not allowing returns online, I could not figure why there is a no-return policy - I thought $ 35+ gone down the drain.

First off, the quality of the clock isn’t really there. It’s light-weight and the material feels rather cheap. The power cord easily disconnects from the clock with every small movement. Also the buttons on mine were misplaced. The “M” button was suppose to be where the “-“ button is. I figured that out after struggling to set up the clock with the directions. The time display is pretty bright, even on the lowest setting so if you prefer sleeping with minimum amounts of light, I would not recommend this clock. The best thing about this clock is the large time display. It's easy to read from far distances. The alarm function wasn’t bad, just your typical alarm beeping sound. The alarm worked fine.

The components are great, good graphics, good memory, good battery; an all around good laptop for work and light gaming. The problem is the case. The case is a piece of crap. It’s made of a brittle plastic, and all of the screw mounts in the screen joints begin to rip out of the plastic simply by the wear and tear of opening and closing the laptop. The screen is only mounted to the mainframe on the right side; the left side is simply screwed into the plastic. I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn’t working properly. I know this laptop has tons of good ratings, and I bought it because of that, but I would stay away from this model if you want a laptop that will last you two years or more. \n Summary: Good laptop, terrible case breaks after less than 2 years",

I gave it a try for a month and after becoming accustomed to how to angle the blade and graduating to a sharper blade even, I cant say I would recommend this razor unless you want to devote A LOT of time to your shaving regimen. It does nothing special that any other razor wouldnt do. You cannot do a quick shave so if you're in a hurry forget about it unless you want deep lacerations lol. The best part about this razor is it's good for the environment. I'm trying to cut down on waste but unfortunately will be going back to my old razor until I find another alternative. The blades that come with this razor did not make for a smooth shaven I had bumps and razor burn immediately after shave. My legs and other private areas were not smooth as they usually are with other razors. Even after purchasing a higher quality blade, I could not achieve a close shave. I also tried various creams and lotions and exfoliating prior to my shave, etc. You will cut yourself the first time so be prepared. Unfortunately just as I learned how to use this razor I am outside of the return window and am now stuck with a $40 loss. I wouldnt recommend this over any other safety razor. Also the handle is very short. I have shaved my entire body with this thing and while I did so safely, it took twice as long and the shave was not close. Also I did multiple passes with the highest quality razor and still did not get all the hair or bumps. \n Summary: Nothing special and plan on doubling your shaving time.",

Thank goodness I am pretty good at fixing things and devising solutions to problems. Basically, fixing other people's/companies' poor/cheap designs. After figuring out the right way to assemble this pump, I used it on the first new filter. All I got was a lot of air mixed with some water. I thought at first that this was just the air contained in the new filter element that was being \"expelled\" and replaced by water. After a time, I realized this was not right and looked for the problem. About this time, the plastic tube between the plastic filter adapter and the one-way inlet valve came off of the valve and would not reseal. To fix this, I resorted to a small spring clamp, that you operate with pliers, to fit around and seal the tube to the valve. On the next try, I was still sucking air, so I looked for another problem. This time, after completely submerging the filter in water past the plastic adapter, I discovered that it was the adapter leaking air around the threads. No matter how tight I got the fitting, It still sucked air. I solved this by wrapping some teflon tape around the threads on the filter and the problem was solved. My take away....this is a high priced, poorly designed device and Berkey should redesign and upgrade it. How??? Pre-assemble these using longer tubes and spring clamps on the one-way valves. OUT of space to continue!!! \n Summary: Extremely overpriced for what is! Needs redesign and price drop. Seems to be a common problem",

Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together. \n Summary: We were very disappointed with this product and plan to return it",

I'll start with the worst part: the lumbar support. I have to wonder if the reviewers who spoke positively about spent any time sitting in the chair. It's hard and not near tapered enough, meaning it basically stabs me in the back as I sit. There's no way to disable the lumbar support -- even if I retract it all the way, it still pokes me. The adjustable height lets me choose exactly where I'll hurt later, but there's no comfortable spot and no way to remove the support altogether. The armrests are another problem. The ergonomic recommendations are to have the armrests support your elbows when they're loose at your sides. For me, the armrests don't go low enough -- that is, even the lowest armrest position still forces me to hunch my shoulders. While I paid for the 3D armrests, that was a waste of money. If I try to tilt them inward to comfortably use a keyboard, it makes the back of the armrests so far apart that my elbows can no longer hit them. Perhaps this chair is really great for someone much larger than I am.

It does flex, so you must affix the mounts to the ceiling or it will sag. I contacted manufacturer about the missing parts and they asked me to take a picture of the missing parts, which I find to be both disturbing and humorous. I replied with further detail about the set screw inside one of the channels and lack of mounting hardware. It is now day 3 and I have not heard from them with the exception of an offer to have professional installation for $120. I don't need a pro installer. I need two, 3-inch hangar bolts with an M4 thread. Update: I was able to pop off the channel and retrieve the threaded set screw. I will go to a hardware store and purchase two 4M hangar bolts and hope for the best.

There is no good place to wind the cord, and the hose frequently pulls out its insert slot on the back.

It feels cheap and will be impossible to properly clean in my dog has an accident. I’m working on returning the product right now. I rarely write negative reviews, but it’s upsetting getting ripped off like this. Save your money!

Unfortunately because of the way the straps are designed it doesn’t work all that well for that part. The chest buckle is way too low which I didn’t notice when I was ordering it. If you were to actually try to use this on a child as a harness it’s not very secure and slips way up if they’re tugging on it at all. It would have been much better if the chest strap had been adjustable up and down. One idea I had was adding a strap all the way across that attaches to the pack instead of the shoulder pads and comes across under his armpits. But that’s a lot of work to make it useable. It’s possible maybe he’ll grow into it a little better eventually but that doesn’t really help me now. It really is cute on him though so if you don’t care about the harness it might be worth getting. One other negative is the adjustable part on the shoulder pads isn’t hemmed, so when you loosen it, it can come all the way out and you have to rethread it. It’s a pretty easy fix to just fold over the fabric and sew it, but it’s something that should have already been done. \n Summary: Do not use in sunlight. Writing faded away within a month.",

The adhesive on the base appears to be good only for one application. This product is really good (fantastic even, for Android users - more on that later.) It has two mounting options out of the box: Dash mount and vent mount. The dash mount option is surprisingly excellent - it comes with a really sticky adhesive that really does grip most dash materials, making for a great alternative to hogging an A/C vent in warmer climates. The clamping solution is great: Its electronic, and thus, automatically opens when your vehicle provides power or when you touch the bottom of the device. It automatically closes when your phone is placed against the back plate, touching the aforementioned bottom piece from within. My only \"complaint\" is that the device doesn't automatically open when power is cut to the mount. When I pull the key out of the ignition, power is cut to the mount, leaving me to have to \"extract\" my phone by \"pushing/sliding\" it up and out of the clamp surface. When power is restored next, the device opens up again. \n Summary: Broke after a couple months! Stable mounting options. Innovative clamps.",

Cons: Terrible suction for a brand new vacuum! It picked up dust and what not, but only if you went real slow, and kept the floor attachment tool angled as flat as possible to the surface being vacuumed. If you tilt it up as you moved it back and forth, it just doesn't have much suction to pick up anything - requiring you to go over and over the same area several times. Then you still end up picking up small objects left behind, by hand. This brand- new vacuum would not pick up some small pieces of broken glass; nor even small wood chips; let alone small metal shavings the weight of a paperclip. Note: The suction was poor even even after I emptied, and cleaned the filter. (I went and got my Hoover house vacuum, and found it had no problem picking this glass, wood & metal debris this vacuum couldn't suck up.) Not impressed with suction, and will be contacting Craftsman on this matter. Con's: For a wall mount vacuum, I found it to be a clumsy, poor design - as it required repeatedly removing vacuum off from wall bracket, just to dump out debris into garbage (and clean filter), each & every time it kept losing suction. (Which seemed to happen right away when vacuuming up any fine particle debris. So you either need to just take the vacuum of the wall and drag it behind you - or keep remounting vacuum back onto wall bracket (& plug cord back in) just to use it again. (My intent was to leave the vacuum on the wall, and use it. I had a prior wall mounted vacuum that allowed you to just remove just the dust-bin container that needs dumped - and not have to remove the entire heavy motor assembly.) If you are buying this shop vacuum to drag behind you...and then put back into the wall storage bracket between use, then you may find this design adequate. But, if your intent was to leave the vacuum hanging on the wall, and use the long hose to reach around the entire shop to vacuum - think twice about this product. \n Summary: Don’t buy from Amazon!

Also worth noting is that I got this desk almost exactly a year ago, and for $65, so do with that info what you will. Pros: Cheap, especially for what I paid, and lots of surface area. Cons: I knew this going in, but wow this is my first time owning a fully MDF product. I'm sure there's varying levels of quality in the stuff, but in this desk it's basically reinforced cardboard. I've already had an entire chunk of the desk break off (the wall piece on the back, behind the bigger portion of the L) Also, there's a major technical error: if you use the longer and deeper side of the desk (which I suspect most will), any chair with armrests that's wider than 23\" can not be under the desk due to the shelves, without bringing the left armrest under the smaller left side of the L completely. Other thoughts: Assembly took me about 2-3 hours by myself. Honestly, if you just want an extra desk for more room to put things or something, knock yourself out. But for everyday use, there seems to be much better options for around the same price. \n Summary: They don’t stay on long enough to put your shoes on.",

But the ending is where I rolled my eyes and cringed, They came off as if they were pushing that message, That u need to believe all victims without evidence.

His GF came off to be an idiot throughout the movie. He goes missing and she worries about him, Finally hears from him but learns he been kidnapped. Instead of trying to help him through this, She hears once that he was going to cheat. And instead of asking questions like a normal person, She leaves and apologizes to the one who put him through it. Mountains of evidence would have shown his innocence, So the smartest thing he said was wanting a lawyer. And when he told the cop to F herself. I gave a 2 star, Cause it was somewhat entertaining. So, in my opinion, it seems like they tried to reverse roles and make it be a man getting raped and no one believes him. But if that was the case they already killed that part of the message.

What you get is hex head bolts without the hex head cores cut Update: I went to Home Depot and after 15 minutes of searching the hardware aisle, found a specialty bolt with fine thread that would do the trick. Got home, went to put it in and then found the seat frame was defective too. There’s no threaded place drilled on that side for the bolt. I guess I could try and drill all the way through the seat frame, pick a longer bolt and cap it with a washer and nut. But this frame is so small it would be almost impossible to drill it perfectly straight and not completely damage the integrity of the chair. At this point, my best course of action may be to spend another 45 minutes disassembling and repackaging something that is 95% complete, wasting more time taking it to the UPS store, and get my money back. I’ll only be out the cost of gas, a new bolt and way too much of my time.

I have the Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogger that was a gift, but it is way too big to use as an everyday stroller. After comparing, contrasting, and praying for weeks and weeks, I decided on this J is for Jeep double stroller. Price definitely played a part in my decision, as a mom of twins, when you have to buy two of everything, you want to make the most economical choice possible. My first impression was that it was very cheap looking and flimsy. It is described as burgundy, but it looked way more purple to me. I wasn't happy about this, but I let it go after many people told me it didn't look purple to them. It is lightweight, which I love. It also does not take up much space, an important factor for a mom of 3. But the wheels are plastic, which doesn't make for the most smooth ride. The middle tires twist while the side tires to straight, which makes it wobble from time to time. In addition, it is not the easiest to close. You should be able to use your foot to kick the lever to close the stroller, but many times I find myself in the middle of the parking lot stooped down and pressing the lever by hand just to get it to close. My biggest complaint of all is that the harness does not secure my boys, no matter how tight I pull the straps. They are always able to wiggle their arms out of the chest part of the harness, then they lean forward, which propels their whole body forward, allowing them to drag their feet on the ground. They are also able to lean over and touch the wheels at this point, and there has been an occasion where one of their fingers was smashed. I am returning this stroller and plan to purchase something with better quality wheels and harnesses, or possibly even a belly bar. I like the thought of a side by side stroller so that both of my boys are able to see what's going on, and they seem to take up less space, but I may have to go with the other type. This stroller was a disappointment. The only good thing is that I don't have to use it much because we don't go out a lot where I would need it. Lately i try to go to stores where I know they have double buggies or make sure someone is with me so that we can each but one of my boys in a buggy. \n Summary: Will hold up during physical actions to it but won’t hold",

However they changed it to some cheaply incorporated top that is non adjustable. When you turn the top to grind the spices, they just come out in full crystal form, no grinding at all. The product inside is still amazing, maybe too much garlic now actually, but I love garlic so don't mind that. However there is no way to remove the top without breaking the container. So now I have to buy a spice grinder separate and carefully break this thing as to not fill it with plastic shards or lose half the bottle to transfer it to a new grinder. The only reason I will go through this hassle is the fact that no other spice company compares. I have looked far and wide for a garlic sea salt grinder to replace my empty one from olde Thompson.

I have also taken a full C# course on Udemy that was about 18 hrs long and have been writing code for about 2 years consistently (nearly daily) as a hobby... NOW.. The Good: I think that this entire book series is GREAT for SUPPLEMENTAL learning. It's really nicely structured and provides a lot of great code examples and you know exactly what your looking at. It's so good in fact, that I would probably buy the second and third books in the series (mainly the third) again just for reference. The Bad: My two biggest criticisms of this book are its redundancy and not beginner friendly (which is in the title)... This book is far more code than explanations. This is not a problem in itself, however, There is often little to no deep explanation along with each example and it commonly repeats the phrase \"this will be discussed in more detail later\". Most of the code shows you how to write things, but no real explanation on how to use what you would have learned. A large portion of the book is spent repeating itself in explaining how the code would look if you used another data type (basically changing out 1 word). So for people who haven't written a line of code before, the best way I could explain is, if the author was describing a ball: If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later. This is a ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a blue ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a blue ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a red ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a red ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a green ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a green ball If you don't understand this, don't worry. It will be discussed in more detail later.This is a purple ball and what it looks like: // Some block of code that shows a purple ball ...Anyways that's pretty much what this book is.

It's kind of awkward when writing in portrait, and slightly less awkward in landscape, but still weird. The S-Pen feels really nice but also has some drawbacks. The pen's accuracy is greatest in Samsung Notes, which personally, has a long way to go. Squid is the second best app for writing, but other than that, there are no other writing apps that work well with the tablet. The latency in other apps are bad enough to not even bother using the S-Pen. The button on the the S-Pen is ill placed and I accidently press it more than I'd like. I honestly should've returned it but I was past the return date. If you want a tablet to watch movies on and occasionally jot down a few things, this is it.

When the battery is running low I might get a quick static feedback like the range is too far from my shorts pocket to the headphones on my ear but it's extremely brief. Sound quality and noise isolation is great, with the volume up I can't hear the generic workout radio they have on or much of the weights clinking together.

Both my wife and I felt extremely optimistic given the high reviews. However, we are now promptly returning it and will buy from a different brand. First, the crevice tool was never included in the box. If the vacuum actually worked as described, this would not have been a huge issue. As you can probably already infer, the vacuum's functionality (in addition to the missing part) WAS a disappointment. After using it twice (both times fully charged), we realized that our old, much cheaper handheld still worked better. With the brush or extension tube attachment connected, it seemed essentially worthless with regard to suction. Further, even without an attachment, the vacuum literally had no true suction power. It struggled to pick up even the smallest and lightest weight particles on the floor, stairs, counter, etc. Again, given the positive reviews, we were very hopeful that it would be a great replacement. Unfortunately, it's boxed up and will be dropped off at UPS tomorrow. \n Summary: the vacuum's functionality (in addition to the missing part) WAS a disappointment.

I just contacted Amazon customer service and was put through some ridiculous \"reset\" which would have accomplished nothing to fix the problem then was informed I would need to contact the manufacturer as the return window has closed. REALLY? Amazon refuses to, on their own, take care of this very evident fire and safety issue where they certainly would have born some responsibility had my house burned down and is forcing me to \"fix\" the problem on my own. Had I purchased this from target or another store I simply would have returned it for a new one, which is exactly what Amazon should be doing right now. The agent clearly did NOT understand what the real issue is and has caused me to rethink every purchase I make through them. I strongly suggest any reader seeing this to do the same. They could care less when they clearly are selling defective merchandise, they take zero responsibility and the consumer is on their own. Buyer beware, your house could easily burn down and they don't care! **UPDATE** I just posted this the day before yesterday and got no help from Amazon at all, and now the kettle won't shut off at all. You have to unplug it to get it to immediately start boiling water, it WILL NOT stop boiling until you unplug this extreme fire hazard. I'm handicapped and had this put on my bedside table as I do nothing except drink tea all day, so I have watched this piece of garbage go from working well to a complete disaster in less than six weeks.

However, after just over 6 months I started losing the AM radio signal. (YES, the Sirius radio was OFF!). After about 5-10 minutes the AM signal would be back. This would happen about once per month. Quite annoying when you're listening to something interesting on the radio. Today, it got worse. When it happened the AM signal was restored about 20 minutes later.

The personal opinion parts come out every chapter so far. For example, the author says not to wear big bright logos because they draw attention which makes sense. But then he goes on and on about how he didn’t wear logos because he doesn’t believe in free advertising for companies that aren’t compensating him. I could argue that having logos can help hide you in certain backgrounds. Like if you go to a skater park it helps to be wearing a pair of puffy skate sneakers.

However, it's been not barely past two months and suddenly I look over and see a LOT of stickers peeling and falling off (the kids don't touch this- it's high up). This is so frustrating. The only thing I can think of doing is finding some clear glue to press each and every little sticker back on- what a headache. I had to call each grandma up and warn them this might happen to theirs. I even helped press each sticker on tightly and accurately with my daughter so I know it's not because we didn't put it on right.

The sex scenes were a bit too descriptive, but I would not want to read a romance without one or two. I am also getting tired of the single H's who have so many flings and one night stands that they are too numerous to count yet the h's have one or two lovers, haven't had sex for years or they are still virgins. To manage those statistics they have to be discriminating and have standards. A heroine like this wouldn't want to be with a man who has had his dipstick dipped into so many vehicles, it's near ready to retire for a new one. Just saying, it would be nice to read about a discriminating hero for a change.

The other reviews and questions associated with this listing are for other products--not sure what's up with that... Anyway, I have waited quite a while before reviewing this product hoping that my problems were just my imagination and that it would eventually work. Alas no. The dongle had issues from the get-go--if I plugged both an audio cable and a power cable into my phone at the same time, it would seem to work for a short while and then the iPhone volume would drop to zero. I could move the volume slider back up, but it would then drop back to zero making it impossible to listen to anything. It works fine if I just use either the power cable side or the audio cable side, but not both at the same time. This kinda defeats the purpose of it. Recently it just stopped working altogether and I would have to unplug the audio cable and plug it back in before it would start again. Recommendation?
