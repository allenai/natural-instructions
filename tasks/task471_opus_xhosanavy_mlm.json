All entities within a cell must have unrestricted broadcast of datagram messages to all other entities within the cell. By definition, the entities in a cell are homogeneous, and at the same security classification level. For example, a set of interconnected SIMNET simulators using the same terrain database constitute a cell. A cell is usually located on a single local network, but it is possible to distribute one over a wide area network if sufficient bandwidth is available and latency is low enough to maintain coherency. If any type of interface is required to network with a remote site, the two sites are different cells.
