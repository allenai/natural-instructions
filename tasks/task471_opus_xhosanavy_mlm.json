The directive force of a gyroscope, while 100 times more powerful than that of the magnetic needle, is still further amplified by an auxiliary electric motor sufficiently powerful to operate the compass card in azimuth. Repeater compasses, installed wherever desired about the ship, are operated by the master compass containing the gyroscopes by a simple electric follow-up system. The gyroscopic compass is not affected by magnetism from any source. It points to the true north, not the magnetic pole, and hence required no calculations for corrections. It is not affected by cargo or any type of magnetic field which may surround it and it is not disturbed by jars. It has become standard equipment in navies and is coming into more general use on commercial vessels."]}, {"input": "The Queen's Regulations state that the Officer of the Watch is primarily responsible that orders are given to prevent any person going on to the weather decks when the weather is such as to make it dangerous.", "output": ["The Queen's Regulations state that the Officer of the Watch is primarily responsible that orders are [MASK] to prevent any person going on to the weather decks when the weather is such as to make it dangerous."]}, {"input": "Some of the ballast is arranged to be readily portable so that adjustments can be made to the vessel's trim to compensate for changes in weight and moment arising from modifications during refit.", "output": ["Some of the ballast is arranged to be readily portable so that adjustments can be made to the vessel's trim to [MASK] for changes in weight and moment arising from modifications during refit."]}, {"input": "The warning cry to those below if something above them is about to be let fall, or may be accidentally falling, is ' Stand from under!' or ' Under below!'
