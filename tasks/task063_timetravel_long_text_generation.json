    "Definition": "In this study, we first provide an original story consisting of exactly 5 sentences. We then provide a new 2nd sentence which makes the original subsequent stoyline (i.e., 3rd, 4th, & 5th sentences) no longer coherent or logical. You need to edit the 3rd, 4th, and/or 5th sentences if necessary to make sure the new storyline is coherent. Please make sure that: You only make minimum edits on the 3rd, 4th, and/or 5th sentences, respectively. If nothing needs to be changed for a sentence, then just copy the original sentence. With your edited sentences, the whole new 5-sentence story is coherent and logical. \n Things to avoid: . \n Emphasis & Caution: Sometimes you only need to edit one of the three subsequent sentences, or change only a few words in the subsequent sentences.",
