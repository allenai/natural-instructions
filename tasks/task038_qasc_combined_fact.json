    "Definition": "Combine the given two facts to write a concluding fact. Note that, there should be some parts of the first and second fact which are not mentioned in this conclusion fact. Your combined fact should be the result of a chain between the two facts. Chains form when two facts connect together to produce a concluding fact. An example of a chain is: \"pesticides cause pollution\" (fact1) + \"pollution can harm animals\" (fact2) \u2192 \"pesticides can harm animals\" (conclusion fact)\nThings to avoid: -\nEmphasis & Caution: Parts of the concluding fact overlaps with the first and the second fact. To construct such a  concluding fact, a useful way is to borrow the subject from one fact and the ending conclusions from another fact. ",
