        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: obscene and non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

Trump is also profoundly ignorant, but he is not a \"decent guy;\" he is a deeply disturbed and unfit individual. We can be thankful that, on many issues, he seems to be backing down or tempering his actions. But there is no guarantee that will continue. The next time Americans elect a President it could be someone who is much smarter, has a much stronger set of destructive principles and ideology, and who is, as a result, an even greater threat to the world.

The idea is to connect the high tech sector of waterloo, with that of toronto... but to also connect the more manufacturing and rising tech sector of london. We all know the fucking via train sucks from london to toronto. It takes forever, is probably comparable to flying in price, and you can drive there faster. This is a project that could potentially revitalize the niagara peninsula and take a lot of traffic off the 401.",

I was tying to explain how the Confederate Flag symbolizes being \"Southern\" for white and some (not many) black Southerners without them having to be racists.

We saw what happened when the government guaranteed home loans to anyone with a pulse.  \n\nSenator Cruz's addition to the bill returns a small portion of the free choice Americans used to enjoy. The insurance companies would have to compete for business and have lower profit margins. Is it any surprise that they want Uncle Sam paying bills for an ever expanding captive market?  \n\nJust repeal this stinking Socialist boondoggle.",

Obama was beholden to Wall Street since he was a Senator. The media made Obama for the illusion of change; but the establishment does not want progressive change. It wants elitist business as usual, which is exactly what Obama delivered.\n  Americans like Obama as a cool, classy black man who doesn't make them feel guilty about racism, poverty, classism, war, American imperialism, the culture of gun violence, police occupation of inner cities, American exceptionalism.\n   He's much like Jimmy Carter. After the Vietnam War, folks invested much hope in President Carter for big progressive changes, but Carter, like Obama failed to deliver. That's the way the American system is rigged.\n   One more failure - Obama should have endorsed progressive Bernie Sanders.",

Like management has the right to direct the workforce. Unions specifically don't have comanagement rights. Like how to clean toilets. What stands out in the article above is how the Hawaii public worker collective bargaining law rules out any negotiations on working conditions. A standard feature of pretty much all collective bargaining agreements. An example, AC in the schools. When you get to the heat levels in some of Hawaii classrooms it becomes a health and safety issue. Yet teachers could niether file a grievance, nor even negotiate it.

WW1 and the Russian Revolution changed the status quo far more considerably than WW2 (In 1914 \"the lights went out all over Europe\", a whole way of life ended for ever). The bishops of the time saw no reason to reassess our relations with Protestants, Jews and atheists, the door was always open to them. There were no complaints from ordinary Catholics about the liturgy either.\nAfter WW2 Pope John surprised the most of the Church by calling a Council, I was in Rome at the time and it was like a bombshell. Everyone was waiting for the next pope and expecting him to be Cardinal Siri who certainly would not have called a Council.\nThe defections came about not because people were conscience stricken but because they were lured away from the path of virtue by liberalism, consumerism and hedonism and the Church stopped preaching against such things. The same happened in Eastern Europe since the Wall came down and the modern Church still ignores it.",

They haven't... so I conclude this is a witch-hunt...and not a realistic assessment of any widespread problem.\"\n\nTo describe Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse as an unrealistic \"witch-hunt\" addressing a manufactured problem sounds bizarre to me.

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA.

I've been in tough spots where I've had to frequent food banks because I \"made too much\" for food stamps, but wasn't making enough to afford rent, bills, bus fare, and groceries. Not all homeless act out of violence. Yes, some homeless do drink or take drugs, but for the most part, they keep to themselves and get just as annoyed at the other homeless who abuse substances as some of the people speaking on here do.

We see that the Lubac-inspired \"Lumen gentium\" might have looked radical with its talk of the \"people of God\" and the dignity of the laity, but it's hardly a manifesto of revolution; and in fact it seems easily to have supported JPII's empowerment of the conservatives, including the hierarchalism and arch-sacerdotalism of Benedict XVI and even Raymond Burke (mein Gott!).\n\nI was only suggesting something, but don't claim to know.

Or when they won't hire people from a particular group .  At one time, many of these Christians also refused to provide their services to non-Caucasian people and they believed it was moral and right.  There was a time it was perfectly legal for an ad for a job to note:  Catholics need not apply.  What is different in attitude if the issue is LGBT people?\n\nI grew up in the segregated South during the 1950s and 1960s.  I have seen and lived with how a majority can band together and make life miserable for a minority.  This is the same song, just a different verse.",

The scientists who showed that atmospheric CO2 was not, in fact, the Earth's' thermostat, would be the Newton or Einstein of our age. She or he would redefine our knowledge of the universe.

Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

You presume two hugely presumptuous precepts in your argument.  The first is that the being that created the universe could not control physical conditions on Earth, including flora and fauna, if he chooses to and the second that man has a right to God's continued protections though rejecting him.  \n\nScientifically your comment is naive.  The second law of physics states that all closed systems will move toward decay (entropy), not order.  We have rejected God and our \"closed system\" is moving to decay without his intervention.",

As you do that, you are doing the same thing, lumping people together, and assigning blame. \n\nWe in this country are divided enough without this common process, from both sides, of lumping people together and false labeling.

They also made it near impossible to get an MM card, and if you did, you were subject to a courtesy check to make sure you were in compliance with the law, which is vague at best. Very few Doctors were willing to stick their neck out to give you a MM card. It is still that way today. They are treating recreational about the same. Dragging their feet, kicking and screaming \"Marijauna is the Devils weed!\" the whole way. A few places are finally getting somewhat of a green light. But, don't hold your breath.

Horgan and Weaver should stop acting like they are the new Kings of BC - it is silly and appears arrogant. \n\nI'm not a fan of Clark, but the alternative is a bunch of economy destroying incompetents. Clark should step down as leader, then the Libs  will easily win the next election.",

Jews hate Samaritans; Samaritans hate Jews.” \n\nExactly, Bishop Tom!  The first miracle in this story is that these two are even meeting.  According to the religious/social rules of their day there is no way they should even be talking with each other.  Yet again, Jesus ignores rules that are a burden and barrier to Grace.  He converts this Samaritan woman, and she in turn converts her whole village.  There are so many religious and social lessons here it is hard to absorb all of them.  Perhaps the first one is do not put up barriers between yourself and others based on religion or ethnicity.",

They're so racist they're willing to collude with foreigners to damage the United States. They're disgusting traitors.

AKA raise the price.\n\nAnd stop listing to self interest groups who always have a great way to spend the taxpayers money on their pet projects, while ensuring that their funding continues to flow.

The slurs the Nazis and KKK were using moved from racial slurs to gay slurs to anti-Semitic slurs with frightening regularity. They wanted to make sure they terrorized certain groups of people and they did just that. Jewish folks, LGBTQ and people of color are now feeling trepidation when walking home alone at night in Charlottesville (and many other areas of this country). \nI only mention this because Trump has already broken his word on \"supporting LGBTQ people\" and it makes me wonder if that's who he'll hit next in order to rally his base AGAIN. Since the Nazi's were very vocal in their gay hate rhetoric in Charlottesville, I think it's a subject that should be discussed openly and honestly before something bad happens and Catholics wish they had spoken against the homophobic rhetoric being spewed by the Nazis.   \nMy two cents worth.",

In Bedford, Virginia, a memorial to the invasion will be unveiled with statues of western Allied leaders, including President Franklin D.

The memorial will also include a bust of dictator Joseph Stalin.\"\n\nIt certainly is puzzling why one of the greatest monsters of the 20th century would be so honored.

This level of taxation will in no way allow the gov't to reach it's 2030 targets. Even assuming it did, it would make literally no difference (zero) to the amount of co2 in the atmosphere by that date.

It says that he was staying in the Anchorage hostel as a monthly resident when this story makes it clear he was paying $30 a night.\n\nIt says \"agents,\" implying agents of the FBI, gave him his gun back, when that obviously wasn't the case.\n\nTwo of the more scary parts of this is that he was identified as being nuts in Puerto Rico, years ago, and his gun was taken away by police, only to have it given back there, as happened in Anchorage. Also, thanks to the NRA, its is quite difficult for the police to take guns away from psychotic people in many jurisdictions, especially Alaska.

Either they don’t really intend to do anything substantial about abortion laws or there isn’t much they can do.

It found that easy forgiveness in confession encouraged recidivism. The Commission recognized that the Catholic Church is not the only religion that has this problem, but the evidence mainly came from Catholic case studies and those who treated such priests. A civil reporting law and a canonical prohibition of absolution can work together to discourage this use (or abuse) of the sacrament.  A civil reporting law is useless if the confessor doesn’t know who the penitent is. A canonical prohibition, if widely publicized, will be much more effective because the abuser will know that it is pointless going to confession if he knows that absolution will be refused until he hands himself in.

The prices of those homes skyrocket to well over one million dollars from overseas money.\nStep 3. Local workers there give up trying to get mortgages for dozens of times their annual salary.\nStep 4. A massive drop in mortgage debt occurs because overseas money buys houses all cash down.\nStep 5. Local workers, now relegated to renting, compete for expensive and rare available units.\nStep 6. The high rents and very long commutes and lousy wages necessitate borrowing from banks.\n\nOr wait a minute, is that model really far-out, zany and ridiculous?",

There was a similar complex built in the West end of the city, but I don't think they had the fenced yards we had.    There were enough kids in the complex to have teams to play hockey or volleyball or whatever game we wanted to play.\n\nWhen I was small, an older kid carefully built a rink at one end of a yard so he and his friends could play hockey at night.   Not only were the younger kids able to skate during the day, but he also helped us build an ice slide beside it, complete with steps!  And there were no bullies in our neighbourhood - because they weren't tolerated.   These were not highrises.  The population was small enough that everybody knew each other.

There is plenty of evidence of racism - some of it systematic and fairly obvious throughout our history too - in many cases WORSE than in the U.S.      Eg:   The treatment of Canadians of Japanese descent was a clear black mark on Canada vs the way the U.S. handled the internment of Americans of Japanese descent.",

But when your political beliefs take on the characteristics of religious values, and you start using the Bible to support those values, the distinction is pretty tough to see and maintain. \n\nThis dangerous proclivity is conservative in the sense that political powers tend to stamp out religion as a source of legitimate authority and/or invoke religious symbols to reinforce their values. Those who seek radical transformation sound quite liberal until they have succeeded. Then they become quite repressive and conservative when the roots and fruits of what they have planted are threatened. \n\nDoes anyone think for a second that, if liberals were in charge of the G.C. non-ordination of women would be an policy option anywhere in the world church?

I opposed bringing into the military a class of individuals with mental disorders and then providing them taxpayer-funded sex reassignment surgery and mental health care.  I have modified my position slightly.  I think transgenders should be allowed to join the military if they can convince military psychiatrists that they are not suffering from or have a history of stress, anxiety or depression or other mental disorders.   That sets the bar high, making it difficult or impossible for most transgenders to join, but it would be fair because the mental standards would apply to everyone.",

You neglected to consider the casualties of two world wars and the Civil War, predominantly fought among Christians, and the catastrophic wars in Iraq and Vietnam, initiated by Christians. It's nearly meaningless to refer to \"Christians,\" as you can believe almost anything, from having sex with minor children to handling snakes and speaking gibberish, and claim to be a Christian. It's the world's all-purpose religion, and allows you to do anything. It started among the followers of an other-worldly mage who denounced material wealth, temporal power, the bonds of consanguinity, in order to pursue the kingdom of god. It is now the religion of well-off, family-oriented, politically active nationalists. Magic!",

They want true drug addicts addicted to these new medications that are VERY expensive. I have found a natural herb that is amazing, non habit forming - and, OF COURSE, the DEA is out for that.

I'm glad that he's not giving in to your devious attempts to change him. I'm glad he's sticking to his priorities which he made perfectly clear to you.",

Biases are learned implicitly within cultural contexts. People may develop biases toward or against an individual, an ethnic group, a nation, a religion, a social class, a political party, theoretical paradigms and ideologies within academic domains, or a species.[1] Biased means one-sided, lacking a neutral viewpoint, or not having an open mind. Bias can come in many forms and is related to prejudice and intuition.[2]\"\n\nIf you dislike Trump, it's likely based on an assessment of his values, not your personal bias.   regards, Gary",

There is no reason to keep more than two or three years of pension obligations invested in fixed income assets. There is also zero justification to invest in foreign stocks. That diversification argument was destroyed years ago. If the US stock market catches a cold, the rest of the world will be coming down with double pneumonia.

Right? Our Constitution isn't a roadmap or an operators manual giving specific instructions about how to do everything. Nobody in 1788 had any idea, for instance, that we would need regulation of radio spectra. Our Constitution sets broad goals and divides powers among the federal government and the states, and defines broadly the establishment of an Executive, a Legislative body, and a Judicial hierarchy. If our Constitution didn't need daily interpretation we would have no need for the Judicial. Without the Judicial the Executive would usurp all powers, and we don't want that, do we. Right now we are seeing that check and balance impeding the raw will of our president. It's a great show and we need to pay less attention to Trump's absurd theatrics and keep our eyes on the real show.",

Well the chickens are coming home to roost and they are asking how is it going to be paid for.  Problem is that nothing is free and someone has to pay the bill for all these \"great\" programs.  So the middle class has to pay more taxes like the \"Cadillac Tax\" on their \"overly generous\" health benefits.  Young people who had no insurance were suppose to buy the cheap Obamacare premiums and those with fat stock portfolios were suppose to cough up as well.  In the end, none of this happened.  So who pays for the deficit created by Obamacare?  The State of Hawaii?  Certainly not the Federal Government who only prints the money to fund the deficit spending.  Tax the Rich?

Trump was rightly excoriated pre-election for refusing to say that he would accept the results of the election, and now post-election it is Democrats who are refusing to accept the results.  Democrats messed up.  They probably did not anoint the best candidate to begin with (although I reject 90% of the B.S. that Republicans have labeled her with), they did not adequately address the economic concerns of the voting public (although I have serious reservations about Trump being any better).  Many voters were too apathetic to bother to vote.  Democrats need to stand aside and let Trump take his swing.

He didn't get there by being stupid and over the years he has developed a keen skill for evaluating people for their leadership abilities and putting them in positions where they can develop and deliver both growth and profits. So it will be interesting seeing how quickly and severely his management style conflicts with the entrenched bureaucracy and how much change he is actually able to drive.

Again trying to make himself out to be a hero. \nYou're just a Lyin, Leakin, Dimwit Comey. Lock him and his buddies at the FBI Up!",

They were rigid, & not much room for reflection or self-expression; But the academic, ruler and yardstick discipline - and no girls - did help me learn to focus academically.  \nHowever, I've no empathy for this decision - and I might feel differently if the sexual misbehavior of so many priests hadn't put the Church in the position of the child-molesting pot calling the homosexual-lesbian kettle black.\nThe Juneau Chapel is a locals & tourists quiet spot of beauty and tranquility. If they don't want Alaskans or visitors of other faiths or of non-heterosexual preferences to use the Catholic Chapel itself for ceremonies - I can understand that - to a degree.. \nBut the grounds could certainly accommodate a roofed/open deck for others to engage in positive spiritual sharing on occasion. The Bishop's stance would be quietly clear, yet the Shrine still be spiritually welcoming place to all.",

A vote to approve requires only 51.  Neither of Obama’s appointees faced a filibuster. Nor did President Bush’s first nominee, John Roberts.  Seven of the eight justices currently on the Court, prior to Gorsuch, did not face cloture votes, meaning they were not subject to the 60-vote threshold to which Democrats are insisting nominees are consistently held. \nThe only nominees to face filibusters along ideological lines were filibustered by Democrats. Gorsuch wasn't going to be filibustered for any other reason than that he was Trump's nominee.\nWhat's weakening our Democracy is fanatical progressivism.",

The fact that the City doesn't have funds to pay for the basic services of a city, including the creation and maintenance of infrastructure, means that the budget isn't allocating funds properly or primarily, that the province is not paying its fair share of gas taxes to Toronto.  Gas taxes should go to transit and infrastructure, period.  It'll only get worse thanks to Tory's stubbornness toward rebuilding the east Gardner and above all, sticking with subway rather than LRT in Scarborough.  Lots of money there.  Regardless, I think this is an issue of the province underfunding Toronto.  No tolls needed, gas taxes are already collected by the province.  Where are they going?",

The only thing that happened in Canada is that the Bank of Canada purchased CMHC secured mortgages from the Banks and other Financial institutions.

Otherwise the only other route was to turn off the access to credit especially to the commercial sector. \n\nWhen some idiot states that this was a sweetheart deal for the banks, I remind them that the banks never took up to the available limit. That was because they were giving up the interest rate return on solid investments. \n\nThe Government of Canada made good money on that deal.",

No free expression, no free press, no freedom of association, and a constitutional amendment that would give Erdogan the powers of a Sultan.

Those coal miners and their families (including their ill parents, or ill children) had often gone uninsured before the ACA.  They still supported Trump, but not on the repeal of Obamacare.  Amazing how afraid they were, justifiably so, and that is became clear to them at just how unjust Trump could be in such vital areas.

Most of the shrines there are connected to the quarry. It is the main feature at the summit and runs seven and one half miles. ... adzes in various stages of production, chips, refuse from the production. When I first saw it I thought it was a 20 th century mining operation because of the refuse. The positioning of the shrines around the quarry indicate that the spiritual activity on Mauna Kea was related to the quarry. Workers homes, and garbage dumps (middens) are there. Indicating it was commoners doing the mining and manufacture. ... native Hawaiians placed the largest mine and adze factory in ... a sacred precinct and operated it for a thousand years.\"  Give it up Thomas.

In Utah, campus rape increased nearly 50 percent between 2012 and 2013. By contrast, sexual assaults nationwide have been decreasing each year by approximately 3 percent. To be sure, this data doesn’t prove that allowing guns at universities and colleges in Utah and Colorado caused those crime increases.

He'd threaten, draw a red line and when somebody crossed it, he moved the line.  Isis didn't start losing  in Syria until Russia started hitting them. The rebels that Hillary gave only lip service to, were weakening Syria's ability to fight off a much greater threat in Isis.  Today we are in Syria, with Russia,  fighting a common enemy. An enemy that would enslave all people everywhere and simply execute those they couldn't.  I would hope defeating Isis  is your goal as well?",

Essentially,  these abused children grew up and moved home where the abuse they learned and internalized was passed on to the next generation, and so on.  If it wasn't for the settlers creating this horrible circumstance with their social meddling, there never would have been a problem, as many Native families were quite successful prior to the residential school period.  One always hears stories about mutual respect for persons and property in the early part of the 20th century, to a major sea change in the latter half of the century.  clearly, that is what the combined residential school experience and subsequant scoop created.",

Elway doesn't have a clue on building a offensive line and the defense without Wade looked soft.

Afraid to be different than our peers.  Afraid of speaking our minds.  Afraid of being unfriended of Facebook, Twitter, whatever.  Afraid of finding ourselves on a no fly list, a terrorist watch list, or under suspicion for home-schooling our own children.

Immediately institute an export tax on softwood lumber exports to the US, high enough to quadruple the cost of lumber.

Stipulate that all material to be used in the building of the new US - Canada bridge at Detroit be Canadian.

I'm  in favor of seeing the PFD restructured but not until SB21 is revised, the \"new oil\" clause is struck and the subsidies  permanently repealed. The Governor presented a balanced plan of revenue increases and substantial spending cuts that were ignored by the legislature.

It was so quaint that there was an outcry for the Council to repeal it, which the Trads fought off and ultimately Ottoviani scuttled.

Perhaps that  will happen but I would not hold my breath. I believe that the biggest change is that parents are today more aware of the dangers their children face with regard to sexual abuse. They are also more aware of the effects that sexual abuse has on a child. The work SNAP has done has helped to educate our society that children are not only in danger from strangers but also from priests, boy scout leaders, coaches, teachers etc.  When I was growing up back in the fifties and sixties, A common theory was that children are resilient. I believe we have learned that children are indeed resilient, but that resiliency has its limits.",

I, as I note in another post, have concerns with the treatment of non-Israelis by the Zionists, but separate that from my feelings about Judaism.

The governors and legislators went into emergency sessions to immediately pass the immunities while all other government business takes months and years to pass.  Within 6 months after the gift, Boeing moved 1000 jobs out of Washington to California.  So much for promises.  This was orchestrated by the same management team and board which had outsourced airplane parts manufacturing to Italy.  The defective parts had to be reconfigured in Seattle as none of them fit the plane's schematics.  The management retired with their golden parachutes in millions.  The cowardice of government at all levels against this defense contractor leading looter is insanity plus.  Until this One Party system is dismantled, the looting will continue.",

That agreement led to BEE, which created the environment that exists today, without which the Guptas would not have found the fertile ground to promote their special brand of favours. \nBEE is legalised bribery. Terreblanche and Mbeki were scathing of it, Mbeki particularly of a top ANC member who went into business and became an overnight multi-millionaire (hint: he would be king). \nIt is not about enriching the black population - poverty is increasing - but the black, ANC elite. Like apartheid where one group benefits above others, conditions for immorality and corruption are created. So BEE and the many who are willing to benefit from it are the main casual agents that led to the rampant corruption we have, and it started with big business, including those BLSA today represent. It's not history, as you incorrectly believe. You're naive if you think otherwise. Those who forget history will repeat it.",
