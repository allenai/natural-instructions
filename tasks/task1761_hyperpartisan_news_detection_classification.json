            "input": "Only seven months into his puzzling presidency,Donald Trump has accomplished an odd achievement:He's made Sigmund Freud relevant again.Although the father of psychoanalysis is no longer fashionable, the Freudian concept of psychological projection is alive and well.  I think he's crazy,  said Sen. Jack Reed, a RhodeIsland Democrat, speaking into an open microphoneabout Trump. J. Brien Comey, father of fired FBI director Jim Comey, thinks Trump belongs  in an institution.  Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin has questioned the president's  mental stability.  These aren'ti solated examples. Many prominent liberals,conservatives, moderates, and libertarians have concluded that the president is off his rocker.The tangible evidence for that proposition is thin, and Trump seems to be enjoying himself more and more. Maybe we're all just projecting.  Trump Derangement Syndrome  is the phrase used by those sympathetic to the president to explain liberals' hair-on-fire response to anything Trump says or does. TDS is also an occupational hazard of being a member of the Republicane stablishment or a movement conservative who caresabout such trite concepts as political principles. This became clear again last week in the hysteria over Trump's approacht o the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In response to the administration's original announcement rescinding DACA, liberalscame unglued. Not content to call the decision dumb and racist, which they did, they played the sanity card.  It is lunacy,  opined Minnesota's Democratic governor, MarkDayton. The president, added HBO comedic punditJohn Oliver, is out of his mind.  Utterinsanity,  proclaimed Susan Hay, a co-founder of a Florida-based pro-immigrant andrefugee nonprofit. That was then. A fewdays later, after dining on Chinese food (youcan't make this stuff up) at the White Housewith Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosiand Chuck Schumer, Trump reversed field on DACA.In the real world, such a development is calledprocessing new information. In modern U.S.politics, it's considered treason -- orinsanity. This time, it was conservatives whomelted down. Ann Coulter pronounced it the death of theGOP brand; Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, animmigration hardliner, claimed it would crack  Trump's core base ofsupport; various commenters on conservative newssites theorized that Trump had been taken over byaliens. Not the illegal kind, the kind from outerspace. Since before Trump'sinauguration, Democratic attorneys in thenation's capital have contemplated replacingTrump under the 25th Amendment's requirementthat the president is able to  discharge thepowers and duties of his office,  i.e.impeaching him on grounds he'sintellectually incapacitated. Althoughthis idea itself is bonkers, Coulter alluded toit\u2014not unfavorably\u2014Friday.  Atthis point,  she tweeted,  whoDOESN'T want Trump impeached?  Fellowconservative pundit Laura Ingraham, more measuredin her criticism, noted that MSNBC host JoeScarborough had spent most of the year speculatingthat Trump is  mentally unstable [but] ispraising him today.  Ordinarycivilians are getting into the psychology racket,too.  Jody,  an Arizona conservativewho dialed in to Ingraham's radio show, saidshe was suffering from a new strain of thedisease:  Pelosi Trump SchumerDisorder,  she called it.  I amdone if they don't build thewall.  Jody was kidding, or at leasthalf-kidding, but stressing out to this degreeover politics is becoming a national obsession. Itcan't be healthy. And as for labeling ascuckoo those with whom we disagree, well,that's an old KGB tactic. We can't letVladimir Putin do that to us. Unfortunately, thepsychology racket is full of those with no senseof history. A new book arrived,unsolicited, in the mail recently with a longtitle:  The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump:27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assessa President.  The cover gives the game away,but the publisher also included a foreword from91-year-old psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, whooffers the melodramatic view that clinicians whodon't warn the world about DonaldTrump's shortcomings are akin to Nazidoctors who worked at Auschwitz. At the risk ofpracticing medicine without a license, I'dsuggest that this historical comparison is defacto evidence of TDS -- and paranoidgrandiosity. A better title would havebeen  27 Angry Democrats With AdvancedDegrees Who Voted Against Trump and Say He'sCrazy Although They've Never Met Him. Lifton and others associated with this project arepart of something called the  Duty toWarn  project. The word  duty is a term of art, given that since 1973, theAmerican Psychiatric Association had cautioned itsmembers against diagnosing patients they'venot personally evaluated. Although this seems likecommon sense, it's more than that:It's a hard-earned lesson. It's calledthe  Goldwater Rule,  and it comesfrom the 1964 presidential campaign. InOctober of that year, when educated elites werejust as unhinged over the idea of a Republicanpopulist in the White House as they are today,provocative left-wing pamphleteer Ralph Ginzburgpublished an article in his  Fact magazine with an incendiaryheadline:  1,189 Psychiatrists SayGoldwater Is Psychologically Unfit to BePresident!  For those too young toremember, Barry Goldwater was a conservativeArizona senator and the Republican Party's1964 presidential nominee. Key in the creation ofthe U.S. Air Force Academy, Goldwater was also adecorated World War II pilot, a fiscalconservative, a fierce anti-communist, and friendsin the Senate with John F. Kennedy. AsDonald Trump would do 52 years later, Goldwaterwrested the GOP nomination away from theEstablishment, creating a fissure in Republicanpolitics that exists to this day. Unlike Trump,Goldwater did not become president. He lost toLyndon Johnson in a historic landslide. I'venever heard any political observer blame the Factmagazine article for that defeat, but it was sonasty and gratuitous that when the campaign wasover Goldwater filed a libel suit in federalcourt. Of the 12,356 psychiatrists queriedby Ginzburg, 2,417 responded \u2013 and only 657pronounced Goldwater psychologically fit to bepresident. Some 1,189 of these quacks diagnosedthe senator -- on the record, with their namesattached \u2013 as unfit, offering such dubiousdiagnoses as  megalomania,  paranoid personality,  emotionallyunstable,   immature,  grossly psychotic,   massmurderer,   immoral,  chronic schizophrenic,  dangerous lunatic  and \u2013stupidest of all --  cowardly. Goldwater won his case, despite the high barpublic officials face in such matters. When hetestified in federal court, he came across asrational, composed, normal, and emotionallyhealthy. His critics were the ones who wereunhinged. Is that happening again? DonaldTrump seemed almost happy last week. Sure, hewants good coverage in the New York Times.Doesn't everyone? And, yes, he'drather spend time with Chuck Schumer than MitchMcConnell. Who wouldn't? He wants to build awall to prevent future waves of illegalimmigration, but has a soft spot for Dreamers.  He was in his elementcomforting hurricane victims. These traits makehim crazy? He could be the sanest politician inWashington right now. Secret Message from GodFound in Human DNA (See What It Says)",

            "input": "The current political alliance betweenPresident Trump and Roy Moore isn't new their collusion goes back at least to2011. It was then that the two teamed upto promote the Birther Lie thatPresident Obama was not born in the USA. Theyserved as active and vocal leaders of this racistcause over the five-year period from 2011 to2016. President Obama's short formand long form birth certificates were released bythe Dept. of Health of the State of Hawaii, inJune 2008 and April 2011 respectively. The birthrecords show that Barack Hussein Obama II was bornat 7:24 pm on August 4, 1961, in the KapiolaniMaternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital inHonolulu, to Stanley Ann Dunham Obama and BarackHussein Obama. In the face of thisdocumentary evidence, many early Birthers  gave up the cause. But notTrump and Moore. They relentlessly promoted thelie, claiming in public speeches and interviewsthat they were privy to inside information thatthese birth certificates were forgeries.Moore, who began his involvement in the causein 2008, declared to World Net Daily in 2010 thatthere was  substantial evidence that Obamawas not born in our country.  Trump, whodidn't publicly join the cause until 2011,tweeted on August 6, 2012 that  an\u2018extremely credible source' has calledmy office and told me that Barack Obama'sbirth certificate is a fraud. Moore's  substantialevidence  and Trump's  extremelycredible source  never, of course,materialized. Moore combined his birtherclaims with the Islamophobic lie that Obama wassecretly a Muslim, while Trump cleverly used thelie in his Presidential campaigns of 2012 and 2016to solidify the nationalist, racist, anti-Obamacore of his base. The politicaleffectiveness of the Birther Lie can be seen inthe results of the NBC poll of September 2016. Inthe responses by registered Republicans only 28%agreed with the statement that  Barack Obamawas born in the United States.  Another 41%disagreed, and 31% stated that they didn'tknow one way or the other. The Birther Lie appearsto have sowed doubt about the President being bornin the U.S., and thus the legitimacy of hisPresidency, among nearly three-quarters ofregistered Republicans. Trump officiallygave up the  Birther Lie  on Sept. 16,2016, with Moore doing so 3 months later. WhenTrump gave up the lie, however, he replaced itwith another one \u2013 naming his opponentHillary Clinton as the originator of the wholebirther idea, again of course without anyevidence. And now, in late 2017, Trump hasapparently decided to revive the lie, lettingpeople around him know that he still believesit. The  Birther Lie  shows usthat Trump and Moore are inveterate liars. So whyshould we believe them when they completely denythe credible testimonies of the more than 21 womenwho accuse one or the other of these men of sexualmolesting them? Once again, these  birtherbuddies  would like us to ignore credibleevidence and believe more of their big fatlies. Guest author Tony Nugent is asymbologist, an expert in ancient symbols.

While Russian bots sowed division amongDemocratic voters, attackedpeople of color, attackedHillary Clinton, worked to suppress voters ofcolor then spread fake voterfraud claims, Fox News thinks this was acampaign in favor of Clinton's 2016 bid. Well, if it's really a big threatand we want to stop them from meddling in ourelections, why is it that during a three-year timespan the Obama administration really didn'tdo much to stop this from happening,  askedTown Hall editor Katie Pavlich. Shereferred to the 2012 election debate in which MittRomney cautioned that Russia was the greatestAmerican foe over radical ISIS or Talibanextremists. However, 2016 was the first electionRussia is known to have infiltrated.Pavlich and the host then turned to wonder why300 elected officials didn't show up for theclassified briefing held at the FBI involving the Gang of 8.  The 300 members likelydidn't have a high enough clearance level toview the classified documents. The  Gang of8  all have the proper security clearancelevel to have viewed the documents. TheFox host asked former Clinton staffer AdrienneElrod if the entire Russia scandal could have beenavoided if former President Barack Obama hadstopped Russia before they even started. Elrodexplained that there was a lot of work going onbehind the scenes. Given the security level,it's likely much of the informationavailable at the time could not be madepublic. She noted she wished Obama hadacted prior to the election but asked what Trumpis doing today to stop Russia from acting in the2018 election. The Fox host along withPavlich went on to claim that Clinton wascolluding with Russia because her campaignpartially paid the law firm that bought theopposition research dossier from ChristopherSteele. Another portion of the dossier was paidfor by Republicans hoping to discredit Trump priorto the general election. For that reason, Fox Newsbelieves Clinton colluded with Russia more thanTrump did. Fox Newshosts have also alleged that Clinton is behindthe meeting with the Russian lawyer at TrumpTower. Watch the full conversationbelow: 00:00",

' And Idon't know how else to start this interview, otherthan saying: What happened?! [audience laughter;Clinton laughs] What happened? CLINTON: Well,that's the question I try to answer. COLBERT:Okay. CLINTON: Yeah, because it was the question Iasked myself starting on election night. COLBERT:Mm-hmm. CLINTON: And I started\u2014 COLBERT:What time on election night? [audience laughter]CLINTON: Ugh! Well, as I write in the book:Midnight. [shrugs] Midnight. COLBERT: Yeah, Iremember. CLINTON: The dark time of the soul.Midnight. [audience laughter] COLBERT: Yeah, I'mwaiting for it to not be midnight soon. [audiencelaughter] CLINTON: Yeah, right. And so I Iwas asking it like you just said: What happened?!You know? And I figured, maybe I'd better try tofind out, to figure it out. So that's why I doveinto this book. It was, ah, very painful anddifficult, but, at the end, I really feel likeI've done my very best to lay out what happened sothat it doesn't happen again. I mean, that's myprimary goal here is so that it doesn't happenagain. [lengthy audience cheers and applause]COLBERT: Well, a lot of people have said,  'Oh, I,boy, I wish Hillary Clinton would just go away. 'CLINTON: Yeah. COLBERT:  'Just go away. ' CLINTON:Well, you know, if they take up a collection andsend me somewhere really nice\u2014 [audiencelaughter] COLBERT: Really? [chuckles] CLINTON: Imight consider it! COLBERT: Really? Yeah!

[massiveaudience applause] COLBERT: Well, I'm glad you'renot! CLINTON: So. [extended audience cheers andapplause; Clinton smiles and chuckles] COLBERT: Iagree. At first I could understand some of thosecalls people saying like,  'The Republicansare tearing themselves apart; don't give them, youknow, someone to rally around in opposition to, 'because you are a convenient figure for them tounite against. CLINTON: Right. COLBERT: But Iactually do not think that's how what's happeningto our government is going to be stopped. I thinkit's people who are willing to be civicallyengaged and believe in the promises and theprogress of the last fifty years that will savethis country. CLINTON: I agree completely\u2014COLBERT: So thank you so much for not going away.CLINTON: \u2014absolutely completely! COLBERT:But wait a second: It must not have been easy.CLINTON: No. COLBERT: It must not have been easyto write this book. CLINTON: It it wasn'teasy! I mean, it was painful. It was horriblereliving it, and, you know, being as candid, openas I could be about the mistakes I made andtalking about those. But also trying to come togrips, as I write in the book, about everythingfrom, you know, sexism and misogyny, to votersuppression, to the unusual behavior of the formerdirector of the FBI, and the Russians. And theRussians! and you have been sounding thealarm about this because I believe sostrongly that they think they succeeded in messingwith our democracy, and I just can't abide that,so\u2014 COLBERT: Do you think they succeeded inmessing with our democracy? CLINTON: Yes I do. Ido. I do. Because\u2014 COLBERT: To what degree?Like, influencing the vote? Or influencingopinion? CLINTON: Influencing voters, andtherefore influencing opinion, I think is becomingclearer and clearer. I don't know what theCongressional investigations and I don't know whatthe Special Counsel investigation are going tofind; I'm gonna wait for that. But I don't thinkanybody can with a straight face say that theRussians did not set out to influence ourelection, and they did so. This latest revelationabout the way they bought ads on Facebook andtargeted them we're gonna find out a lotmore, Stephen. And I am saying as clearly as I can\u2014 I feel like I'm a bit of a, you know, aPaula Revere; I'm trying to sound the alarm aboutthis [audience laughter and applause] isthat the\u2014 You know, you've gotta understandwhat Putin's strategy is. He really doesn't likedemocracy. He thinks it's an inconvenient, messyprocess. And he doesn't like us, and he wants todestabilize our country; sow doubt about ourdemocracy. I mean, these latest revelations, whereyou had Russians pretending to be Americans\u2014 so you had fake Americans, with fake news,and fake stories, and fake demonstrations \u2014that wasn't just because he's bored and hasnothing to do. He wants to undermine how we seeeach other, how we respect each other, how wesupport our institutions and our society. So, Ithink that they believe they had a good outing intwenty-sixteen, and I think that they will be backin twenty-eighteen and twenty-twenty, unless westop them. [audience applause] COLBERT: Now, youmentioned that he that Putin doesn't likedemocracy and he doesn't like America; part of thespeculation is that he specifically doesn't likeyou. Do you think this was personal on a certainlevel? CLINTON: I think it was mostly about therole I played as Secretary of State, which he didmorph into a grudge against me, because I wouldsay things like, you know,  'The Russian peopledeserve free and fair elections. They deserve tohave a democracy. ' COLBERT: Questioning thelegitimacy of his election in two-thousand eleven.CLINTON: The parliamentary elections, that'sright. And, so, our intelligence community andothers have said that he did have a personalgrudge against me\u2014 You know, I don't take itpersonally. I think it's part of his worldview,which is all tied up with his anger, hisdisappointment in the collapse of the SovietUnion, and his feeling that we're his number onerival he wants to really undermine theEuropean-American alliance. And so I see it as: Iwas doing my job I was honored to do myjob, to stand up and speak out on behalf ofAmerican values and our democracy and,partly because I'm a woman, which does seem to gethim a bit agitated\u2014 [audience cheers andapplause] And he actually has said that, um, somethings about that\u2014 COLBERT: Has he \u2014did he ever say anything to you personally thatdemonstrated his misogyny? CLINTON: Well, hedemonstrated\u2014 As I write in the book, youknow, there's an expression, we certainly know itin New York, called manspreading. [audiencelaughter] COLBERT: [chuckling] Yes. CLINTON: Andevery time I met with him, it would be\u2014[spreads her arms and flops back in her chair,taking up lots of space] Okay? [audience laughter]The whole deal! And, so, I'd go to meetings withhim\u2014 One in particular, we were in his dachaoutside of Moscow, and the press comes in, and hejust berates America about one of the many thingsthat annoys him about us, and then the pressleaves, and I've got four or five things we'retrying to deal with him and Russia on andI always came to my meetings with him trying tofind something that I could actually engage himabout. So, we went through the economy and humanrights and all these other things that arecritically important, and he was, you know\u2014[mimes staring off into space] Like, as PresidentObama once said, like the bored guy in the back ofthe room.

His habit of saying thingsthat nobody ever said before is forcing reportersto unleash their partisan views instead of justgiving the facts. Some of these chargesmay be true, but the one about Trump changingjournalism is demonstrably false. All the more sobecause it comes from the editor of the New YorkTimes, who happens to be the actual guiltyparty. Dean Baquet, the Gray Lady'sboss for two years, recently claimed thatTrump's campaign had forced the paper into anew way of covering politics.  Ithink that he's challenged ourlanguage,  Baquet told aninterviewer.  He will have changedjournalism, he really will have. The claim is presented as one of those chin-stroking insights about a new paradigm thatliberals spot around every corner. In fact, it isjust another example of the Times getting it allwrong. Trump didn't change the Times\u2014 Baquet did. He's the one whoauthorized reporters to abandon the paper'sstandards when covering Trump and express theirpersonal political opinions. Or, as Baquetsaid in the interview with NiemanLab's Ken Doctor, the struggle forfairness is over.  I think that Trump hasended that struggle,  Baquet boasted. I think we now say stuff. We fact-checkhim. We write it more powerfully that it'sfalse.  Fact-checking, of course, isoften in the eye of the beholder, and quicklymorphs into opinion when there is no restraint orneutral standard. The result is the paper'srelentless, daily assault on Trump, to theadvantage of Hillary Clinton. Opinions,all uniformly anti-Trump, now ooze from thepaper's every pore, with headlines on front-page  news  articles indistinguishablefrom daily denunciations on the editorial and op-ed pages. This is not a mere continuationof the old liberal bias that infected the Times,the Washington Post and the broadcast networks foryears. This is a malignant strain of conformitythat strips away any pretense of fairness in favorof strident partisanship. The signal thatthe Times abandoned its traditional church-stateseparation of news and opinion came in an articleby the paper's media reporter two monthsago. In his August piece, JimRutenberg declared that most reporters saw Trump as an abnormal and potentially dangerouscandidate,  and concluded they had a duty tobe  true to the facts, in a way that willstand up to history's judgment. Baquet, in the interview, cited the Rutenbergpiece, saying it  nailed  histhinking. He also said he started  down thistrack  years ago, during the dispute overweapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and made itclear he believed then-President George W. Bushand then-Secretary of State Colin Powell lied totake America to war. The Trump treatment, he said,was a logical extension:  I think hegave us courage, if you will. I think he made us\u2014 forced us, because he does it so often, toget comfortable with saying something isfalse.   This is not a merecontinuation of the old liberal bias that infectedthe Times, the Washington Post and the broadcastnetworks for years. This is a malignant strain ofconformity that strips away any pretense offairness in favor of strident partisanship. Baquet offered another example that gothim to this point. He accused Republicans of lyingin their  swift-boat  charges againstDemocratic nominee John Kerry in the 2004campaign. It is not incidental that hisexamples all involve allegedly dishonestRepublicans, and none involves dishonestDemocrats. Nothing better explains why the Timesfails to give Clinton the same scrutiny it givesTrump. More than 60 percent of voters regard heras fundamentally dishonest, but Baquet sees onlyRepublicans as liars. Simply put, hispolitical bias precludes fair journalism. And oncestandards are gone, they are gone forever, meaninganyone wanting to work at the Times will face apolitical litmus test. Baquet'sdefense of slanted coverage is reflected in thetrove of emails WikiLeaks released from Clintoncampaign chairman John Podesta. Timesreporters and columnists repeatedly show up inpartisan ways. Washington correspondent JohnHarwood sends Podesta his private approval ofHillary Clinton appearances, as if he's onthe team. Columnist Nicholas Kristof, in advanceof an interview with Bill Clinton, emails hisquestions, which Podesta's team passesaround to staffers to shape Clinton'sanswers. A Washington reporter givesHillary Clinton veto power over quotations he canuse from an interview. Another reporter is praisedas someone who has  neverdisappointed  in delivering stories thecampaign wants  teed up  for publicconsumption. As the editor, Baquet shouldbe outraged that his staff secretly compromisedthe paper's integrity. But as theeditor who eliminated the Times' standards,he's getting the biased paper he wanted.Questions for de Blasio  Mayor Bill de Blasiowon't take questionsfrom The Post these days, so here are questionsall City Hall reporters should insist heanswer.  No. 1: Hasthe mayor or his lawyer been informed that deBlasio is a target of federal and stateinvestigations? No. 2: Has the mayor beenordered to testify before a grand jury? Has hevoluntarily offered to do so? No. 3: Didthe mayor ask teachers union president MichaelMulgrew for the $350,000 contribution the uniongave to de Blasio's political slush fund,the Campaign for One New York, a month before theunion got a $9 billion contract? No. 4:Did de Blasio or his wife, Chirlane McCray,personally receive any money, gifts or otherthings of significant value from the consultantspaid millions of dollars by the Campaign for OneNew York? No. 5: Who is paying the legalfees of de Blasio and City Hall aides? How much,if any, taxpayer money has been spent representingthem? The public has a right to know whatthe mayor knows about the investigations,including the possibility he will face criminalcharges. The reporters in Room 9, thelegendary home of the City Hall press corps,should ask these questions every day until theyget answers. Hill corruption is e-asy to seeReading the emails hackedfrom John Podesta's account, I feltsqueamish. But two facts settled my stomach.First, the emails reveal the greed andbackstabbing among the Clinton clan. There is nohonor among those thieves. Second, theclaim that the messages are forged or a Russianplot illustrate how the family fudges facts itcan't deny. That means the emails offer theunvarnished truth, making them unique in Clintonland.  Dem's truthon voter fraud  Alan Schulkin will never eatlunch in New York again. The ManhattanDemocratic representative on the city'sBoard of Elections was caughttelling an inconvenient truth, saying, I think there is a lot of voterfraud.  Schulkin was being secretlytaped by an undercover journalist, so maybe hisparty will forgive him for saying what everybodyknows to be true. Otherwise, he'sgoing to be a very hungry man.",

She's trying to twist thepresidential race into a referendum on politicalcorrectness. Too embarrassed to run on herparty's economic record or her failed stintas secretary of state, she's positioningherself as top cop of the speech police.For example, Hillary is running an ad depictingpre-teen girls looking self-consciously in themirror, agonizing over their bodies. Sometimessuch young girls' worries turn into deadlyeating disorders, ultimately killing 10 percent ofthose affected. Clinton cynically exploits thepain and fear felt by thousands of families. Herad uses a voiceover of Trump saying things like she ate like a pig  and  doesshe have a fat ass?  Parentsstruggling with their child's eatingdisorder run to one doctor after anotherfrantically seeking answers. The causes arecomplex and still not entirely known butno one believes the cause is Donald Trump.Some experts blame Hollywood'sglorification of skinny women for at leastcontributing to the rash of eating disorders andyoung girls' body-image struggles. Insteadof trying to muzzle Trump and other men, whyisn't Hillary calling out her big supportersin the entertainment industry? The samequestion applies to Hillary's doublestandard in bashing Trump for lewdness butcelebrating it in popular music. Clinton'slatest super PAC ads condemn Trump's bawdy2005 remarks on a bus with show-biz journalistBilly Bush. Trump bragged to his buddy,  Imoved on her like a bitch.  Clinton claimsto have been outraged when she heard it, callingit  horrific.  ManhattanInstitute scholar Heather Mac Donald chuckles atClinton's hypocritical  sudden onsetof Victorian vapors.  After all,Clinton has no problem with the salacious lyricsof her pal and supporter Beyonc\u00e9. Even whenBeyonc\u00e9 sings:  I came to slay bitch .. . when he f\u2013k me good I take his ass toRed Lobster.  Clinton says,  I want tobe as good a president as Beyonc\u00e9 is aperformer.  Trump can't catcha break with Clinton, even when he's tryingto do the right thing. Another Clinton ad attacksTrump reaching out to inner-city African-Americanswith promises of more jobs and school choice.Reminding minority voters that Democraticpoliticians have failed to improve their economicopportunities, Trump asks for their vote, saying: What the hell do you have to lose? Clinton's ad says: Everything.  It follows herad featuring Ku Klux Klan members praising Trump.It's McCarthyite guilt by association. Trumphas no connection to the group. What's Trumpactually guilty of? Poaching on Hillary'sturf. Worse than tarring Trump,she's labeling cops, teachers and millionsof other Americans racists. Whenever she talks toblack audiences, she stokes racial resentment.She told the NAACP that whites  need torecognize our privilege and practicehumility.  All whites, she claims, have implicit bias,  and she wants biastraining for police and other professions.Implicit bias you're told you haveit even if you don't realize it, no matterhow colorblind you try to be, and denying yourbias just proves it. Implicit bias is PCdrivel. There's no solid data to support it,cautions social scientists Philip Tetlock of UPennand Gregory Mitchell of the University of Virginiaand experts from New York University and theUniversity of Connecticut. But if Clinton becomespresident, we'll all be undergoing re-education at school or work to cure our implicit bias.  To see whatPresident Hillary's America would be like,look at most college campuses today. Few on campusdare to question Black Lives Matter, militantmulticulturalism and  safe spaces  tospare students from challenging ideas.Hillary's dictating how Americans talkabout race, sex, even body shapes. Trump calls itlike he sees it. He doesn't stick tothe well-rehearsed rhetoric of a careerpolitician. But his supporters are sick and tiredof political correctness. He's notrunning for saint.

He began with hisstrongest argument that the politicalclass represented by her has failed us andit's time to look to a successful dealmakerfor leadership and kept to it pretty wellfor the first 20 minutes. Then due to thevanity and laziness that led him to think he couldwing the mostimportant 95 minutes of his life, he lost thethread of his argument, he lost control of histemper and he lost the perspective necessary tocorrect these mistakes as he went.Methodically and carefully, Hillary Clintontook over. Her purpose was to show she wasrational and policy-driven, the kind of person whocould be trusted to handle a careful and delicatejob with prudence and sobriety and that hewas none of these things. And shesucceeded. By the end of the 95 minutes, Trump wasreduced to a sputtering mess blathering aboutRosie O'Donnell and about how hehasn't yet said the mean things aboutHillary that he is thinking. Mostimportant, he set ticking time bombs for himselfover the next six weeks. As she hammeredhim on his tax returns, he handed her aninestimable gift by basically saying he pays nofederal taxes despite his billions andmoreover, that if he had done so, it would havebeen  squandered  anyway. By the end of the 95 minutes, Trump was reducedto a sputtering mess blathering about RosieO'Donnell and about how he hasn't yetsaid the mean things about Hillary that he isthinking.  That's not going togo away, nor is her suggestion that his refusal torelease his returns is the result of his eithernot being as rich as he says or not being ascharitable as he claims. Clinton quotedhim saying in 2006 that he hoped for a housingmeltdown because it would provide buyingopportunities and thereby goaded him into saying that's called business, by theway.  To which she quickly replied that 9million people lost their jobs and 5 million losttheir homes in the housing meltdown he was soexcited about. Blammo. His reply toHillary's recitation of the fact he'dbegun his career settling a Justice Departmentlawsuit about racial discrimination in Trumphousing was that there was  no admission ofguilt,  which is the sort of thing thevillain said at the end of  LA Law and sounded no better in real life. Evenwhen he could have taken her down, he was soincompetent he didn't go for it. A questionabout cybersecurity was the perfect opportunity tohammer Clinton on her outrageous mishandling ofclassified information. Instead, he wentinto a bizarre digression in which he alternatelywondered whether his son Barron might grow up tobecome a hacker and defended Vladimir Putin fromthe accusation Russia had tapped into theDemocratic National Committee's emails(which the FBI says almost certainly happened).That has to count as the biggest choke of hispolitical life. By the time the last 15minutes rolled around, he was reduced to yammeringabout Rosie O'Donnell being mean to him andHillary running mean commercials about him andpraising himself because there are some reallyterrible things he could have said about Hillarybut hasn't. By this point, even his smartclosing zinger  she has experiencebut it's bad experience  wasburied inside a weird word salad that reduced itseffectiveness to almost nil. Hissupporters should be furious with him, and soshould the public in general. By performing thisincompetently, by refusing to prepare properly forthis exchange, by not learning enough to put meaton the bones of his populist case against Clinton,he displayed nothing but contempt for the peoplewho have brought him this far and for theAmerican people who are going to make thismomentous decision on Nov. 8.",

Hillary Clinton boasts that herexperience traveling to 112 countries as secretaryof state qualifies her to be president.Don't believe it. Evidence shows sheleft the State Department in shambles and ournation weaker. Her record at Foggy Bottomdisqualifies her to be president. Herfailures go beyond leaving four Americans to diein Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the ridiculousRussian  reset  and the carnage inSyria that she and President Obama idly watchedunfold and that gets more horrificdaily. A string of investigative reportsfrom the Obama administration shows that shebotched key management jobs as secretary of state,threatening American lives and our diplomaticsecrets. Clinton's State Departmentrepeatedly rebuffed requests for additionalsecurity for the vulnerable compound at Benghazi,Libya. The result? Heavily armed terrorists wereable to storm the compound and kill AmbassadorChristopher Stevens and three other Americans.But Benghazi wasn't an isolated case.Clinton failed to secure diplomatic posts inPakistan, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and other globalhot spots. Internal State Department reports showthe posts lacked emergency plans in case ofattack. Guards assigned to them had no training inchemical or biological threats and, amazingly,some hadn't undergone background checks.Clinton tried to weasel out of taking the blamefor Benghazi, testifying to Congress that shewasn't personally involved in embassysecurity. But emails later revealed that wasfalse. Investigators also point toClinton's total neglect of cybersecurity.The Bush administration reeling from theattack on the World Trade Center had madeit a top priority to protect information flowamong embassies, the CIA and the FBI. ButClinton dropped the ball, creating what thedepartment's inspector general called undue risk in the management ofinformation.  In November 2013, theIG issued an alert to the State Department'stop executives about the urgent  recurringweaknesses  in cybersecurity that had beenred-flagged in six previous reports between 2011and 2013, almost all on Clinton's watch. The recurring weaknesses  had still notbeen addressed, including vulnerabilities tohackers. One of those previous reports\u2014 from July 2013 (shortly afterClinton's departure) described howmuch of the cybersecurity work was actually beingdone by contractors rather than department staff,contrary to government policy. JohnBentel, in charge of State's cybersecurityduring Clinton's tenure, is one of the fiveState Department staffers who demanded immunitybefore talking to FBI investigators aboutClinton's private-server scheme. Heapparently took his duties regardingClinton's secret server more seriously thanhis duties to safeguard national cybersecurity.According to an IG report, Bentel instructed his subordinates not to discussthe secretary's email.  RudyGiuliani said on Saturday Clinton's use of aprivate email service for official business waslike taking  all our top-secret material andthrowing it out on Fifth Avenue. Outrageous, but still a lesser offense thanClinton's neglect of the entiredepartment's digital security \u2014exposing communications between thousands ofagents and diplomats across the globe. Even afterWikiLeaks released 250,000 confidential StateDepartment documents in 2010, Clinton didn'tplug the obvious holes in State's cybersetup. Yet during Monday's debate,Clinton had the nerve to claim that she takesthreats to the nation's cybersecurity veryseriously. That's a laugh.Hillary's management of finances at Statewas also slipshod, according to inspector generalreports that point to a whopping $6 billionunaccounted for during her tenure. Clinton'schaotic mismanagement created  conditionsconducive to fraud,  the IG warned, and madeit harder  to punish and deter criminalbehavior.  She must have felt right athome. True to Clinton's instinct tocover up problems rather than fix them, shethwarted several investigations of sexualmisconduct and prostitution at State.Investigators complained of  an appearanceof undue influence and favoritism. So what are the odds Hillary would run thefederal government with integrity, keep the nationsafe and get taxpayers more for their money?Zero.

In hisroom on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel,he had 23 guns, some of which were outfitted withbump stocks (devices which allow semi-automaticweapons the capability to mimic the gunfire ofautomatic weapons). He killed 58 people andinjured 527 before being discovered, killinghimself before police could apprehend him. In thewake of the worst mass shooting in modern UnitedStates history, the NRACEO's response to the Las Vegas shooting wasdefiant, belligerent, and utterly tone deaf.Romper has reached out to the NRA and isawaiting a reply. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre,normally a man who keeps a low profile, offered arare interview with Fox News on Thursday. While hedid call the Las Vegas shooting an  'unimaginabletragedy ' during his interview, LaPierre insistedthat stricter gun laws would notchange mass shootings:   If legislationworked, Boston massacre wouldn't haveworked, San Bernardino where California has everygun law on the books, that wouldn't havehappened.  LaPierre went on to quicklyaccuse the  'other side ' of the tragedy; notablyDemocrats and celebrities who have been vehementlycalling for gun control legislation. The NRA CEOlashed out and accused them of trying topoliticize a tragedy, and attempting  topiggyback their whole agenda to ban guns, restrictlaw abiding people for the last 20 years, thiscircus, on the back of this tragedy. The CEO became especially agitated whendiscussing what he believes to be the doublestandard coming out of Hollywood:   Wespend millions of dollars every year, teachingpeople safety and responsibility, and thisHollywood crowd makes billions teaching gunirresponsibility to the American public. Thehypocrisy is beyond belief.  Of course,LaPierre doesn't have actual facts to back upthose claims, and it's important to remember thathe is talking about fictional depictions in actionmovies. When LaPierre accused those unnamed 'Hollywood elites ' of  'protecting themselves withguns, ' while supposedly wanting to get rid ofguns, he has clearly forgotten that few people whohave weighed in on stricter gun control have notcalled for an outright ban of firearms, accordingto Salon. His interview with Fox News' SeanHannity was terribly off the mark, focused onHollywood, rather than the  'unimaginable tragedy 'he referenced at first and then appeared toquickly forget. Movies in Hollywood do depictdeaths, but not actual deaths caused by realguns. Here are a few real-life statisticsabout gun use in America: According to Vox,the United States fares poorly when compared togun violence in countries of similar socio-economic success. There are six times as manyhomicides by  firearmsin the United Statescompared to neighboringCanada, and 16 times as many as Germany. Americansown nearly half of the  civilian-owned firearmsin theworld, according to CNN, 310 million of the 650million civilian-owned firearms worldwide.  Americans own more guns percapita than any other country on the planet,according to a PEW Center study. There are morepublic mass shootings in the United States thanany other country in the world, according to thesame study by the PEW Center.  However badlyLaPierre would like to shift the focus from theLas Vegas shooting victims to his personalvendetta against Hollywood action films, it can'thappen. The reality is, the families of thosevictims need a real, informed, empathetic responseto the mass shooting. Not a distraction.Because they are real people who lost realloved ones at the hands of a man with realguns. This isn't a movie. It's reallife.",

I haven't read it in along, long time. It used to be approved reading bythe intellectual right. My memory was that it wasvaluable here and there. It had some decentinsight. But they're gone. Look at this: The Economist explains how DonaldTrump may be making life easier for MS-13, thestreet gang. This is very long, typically long.The Economist's argument, the point is Trump'stough talk is encouraging and emboldening thestreet gang MS-13. That's right! Tough talk at theNorth Korean lunatic dictator? That's just makinghim bigger! That's just making him tougher. That'sjust steeling his resolve. Now Trump isdoing the same thing -- he's talking tough onMS-13 -- and what's happening? He's making thembigger! Let me ask you a question: What is thestatus of illegal immigration in the country todayversus when Trump was inaugurated? In fact, let'sjust measure it year over year. Illegalimmigration is way down, is it not? I mean, it'sdown by a factor of millions, is it not? It is,folks. Don't doubt me. Have we had any significantchanges in the law? Has there been anycomprehensive or otherwise immigration reform ornew legislation? The answer is, no. There hasn'tbeen any substantive change whatsoever. How hasDonald Trump been approaching the issue? Well,since the middle of 2015, he's been talkin' toughon it, and he's been tellin' people we're going tobuild a wall -- and he's been telling people thatif they come in illegally, we're going to trackthem down and we're going to deport them. He'sbeen telling people if they're here illegally andwe find them we're going to deport them. The pointis Donald Trump has been talking tough on illegalimmigration, and what has happened? It's way down.The number of people trying to get into thecountry illegally is way, way down. Now if youlisten to the left, Donald Trump's tough talk onillegal immigration should have them pouring overthe border. Donald Trump's tough talk on illegalimmigration should be making these illegalimmigrants and their coyotes and their supporterstwice or three times as committed to get in here.But it's not working out that way. Just theenforcement of existing law -- the promise toenforce existing law, the threat to enforceexisting law, the commitment to build the wall,the tough talk, the committed talk on the policy-- is actually working. It is causing there to bea massive, major reduction in the numbers ofpeople attempting to get into the countryillegally. There's documented evidence that toughtalk is working. Honest, tough talk is working.Yet, tough talk with Kim Jong-un?  'Oh, no! It'sgoing to lead to nuclear war! Oh my God, we'regoing to die! ' Same thing with MS-13, according toThe Economist.

I actually felt bad for MGMwhen this tragedy first happened. Butcould it have happened to any Vegas resort? Orwere there factors at play that led to thisproperty being chosen for this terrible massmurder? Murren was appointed by BarackObama to the Homeland Security Council. From thatperch, Murren had insider access to the detailedthreats aimed at Vegas.

One ex-MGM security guardcalled to say Murren's first act in takingover Luxor and Mandalay Bay was to disarm most ofthe guards and declare MGM hotels  gun-free  zones. Maybe that's why theshooter chose Mandalay Bay. Why has thetimeline involving Mandalay Bay guard Jesus Camposchanged so many times? Did he approach theshooter's room before or after the massmurder started? If it was before, whyweren't the police called? Did theshooter choose a MGM property because VIP highroller clients were free to use service elevators,thereby avoiding scrutiny? Finally, wasthe CEO of MGM focused on his properties? Was thesecurity of his customers a main priority? Or washe distracted? SEC records for Septemberreveal more than $200 million in stock selloffsfrom MGM officers and directors.

Or was he too busy selling off hisshares, at the right price, into the open market,without Wall Street noticing? MGM'stop executives and key board members also soldhuge amounts of stock in September. Howabout this eye-popping number? In the past threemonths, according to SEC Form 4, MGM insiders soldoff 6,387,163 shares. Guess how many those sameinsiders bought? Zero. Also in September,while MGM's CEO and insiders were sellingoff huge amounts of their own company stock, MGMannounced a billion-dollar stock buyback program.In other words, they used  otherpeople's money  to buy back MGM stockon the open market to prop up the price.Talk about the world's worst conflict ofinterest. Shareholders were forced to spend $1billion to buy  undervalued MGM stock at the same time the CEO and his teamcouldn't wait to get out. Question:What if MGM had used that same $1 billion toupgrade security or hire twice as many securitystaff instead of to prop up its stock price whilethe CEO was selling? Lastly, did Murrensign for a special  terrorism rider on MGM's liability insurance policy? Will adesignation of  terrorism  vs.criminal mass murder affect the payout from theinsurance policy? Could declaring this a terroract change MGM's bottom line by billions ofdollars? Inquiring minds want to know.Contact Wayne Allyn Root atWayne@ROOTforAmerica.com.

President Trump has made clear since thecampaign that he does not like Iran, and spentmuch of his recent trip to the Middle East pushinghostility toward Iran, as well as portraying Iranas being to blame for most of the terrorism in theregion. That ISIS is the world'sbiggest terrorist organization, and that Iran hasbeen heavily supporting both Iraq and Syria infighting ISIS, doesn't fit intoTrump's narrative, and the fact that ISISjust launched terrorist attacks in Tehran isparticularly unwelcome to the US agenda of tryingto spin everything wrong in the Middle East asbeing Iran's fault. PresidentTrump's answer to this, then, is to remindeveryone that Iran is a  state sponsor ofterrorism,  an official designation by theUS government which means effectively nothing, andonly currently applies to three countries that theUS doesn't like, none of whom has anythingto do with ISIS, al-Qaeda, or other majorinternational terrorist groups.

Marine GeneralJohn Kelly, set to retire later this month, says that these smallnumbers of ISIS supporters are a particular risk,because in small nations like Trinidad and Tobago,they don't have anything comparable to theUS military or the TSA to combat ISIS.Gen. Kelly declared that  just a few ofthese nuts can cause an awful lot of trouble downin the Caribbean,  complaining many of theislands don't even have proper militaries,let alone something like the US military, aleviathan that intervenes globally and rivals thescope off any in human history. ISISissued a video for Trinidadian recruitment wayback in 2015, showing a recruit from the islandand his three young children calling on theisland's Muslim population to join thefight. About 5per of the island's populationis Muslim, or about 60,000 people. The indicationsare that Caribbean-wide ISIS recruitment wasaround 150 people, up from 100 the prior year.In reality, the  threat  here ismuch less about Trinidad not having a globe-hopping military, than that ISIS isn'tmaking such a big deal about recruits coming toSyria anymore, and is instead pressing them tolaunch attacks at home. This is particularlyproblematic for the US because many Caribbeanislands are popular tourist destinations, andAmerican tourists are a likely target. Last 5posts by Jason Ditz",

FromFriday's broadcast of CNN Tonight:   DONLEMON, CNN: So we're back now with my panel. Iwant to bring them back in. Scott Jennings, VanJones and David Swerdlick. Scott, I read thosenumbers differently than you read them. Because itshows that -- I think that most people think thatthe players have the right to do it. They have theright, that they're doing the right thing or thatthey had the right to do it, not that they'redoing the right thing. But I think that I readthat differently, that poll differently than youdid. Van, I'm not sure if that is what you wantedto comment on. VAN JONES, CNN: Well, what I wantto say is what's surprising -- it's not surprisingthat the majority of Americans look down on thisprotest. If you look at the 1960s, 1963, 67, 70percent of white Americans said, hey, stop thisblack protesting. This freedom rights, you'rehurting your cause, the sit-in movement, you'rehurting your cause. Cut it out, it's bad. Hugenumbers of people in the '60s with Dr. King saidstop these black protests. When you look at thesenumbers, these are some of the most popular blackprotests in American history. If you look atcontextually, what they're doing are some of themost popular protests in American history withwhite folks, because in general the white publichas not liked to see black folks protesting. So Isee it differently.    LEMON: I see itdifferently because everyone, listen, when takinga knee, that is in reverence. But even the playerI had on Michael Thomas of the Miami Dolphins saidto me the other night, he said, everybody wouldlike to stand. I think most people would like tostand. What the issue is that -- in that poll, 60percent of Americans think that President Trumpdid the wrong thing by criticizing the athletes.This doesn't necessarily that they agree with whatthey did, but they think he should not haveinserted himself. If you ask someone should youstand up for the flag? Of course they say youshould stand up for the flag. But did he do theright thing in calling them sons of bitches andsaying they should be fired, the majority ofpeople saying, no, he shouldn't have done that.Van, I was talking to you, because I interruptedyou. JONES: I mean Donald Trump never misses anopportunity to miss an opportunity. Here's anissue where his concern is this line with publicopinion, but the way he deals with it is actually,you know, puts him in a super minority in terms ofpeople who are able to somehow bring himself tosupport his language and demeanor. I want to saythis as clearly as I can say it. In this country,African- Americans, no matter what we do -- whenwe sit in, when we freedom ride, when we kneel in,whatever it is, the initial response from thepublic tends to be overwhelmingly negative,because basically we're kind of raining on folks'parades, I don't want to hear this stuff. As timegoes on, the Muhammad Ali's and all the peoplethat raised those issues, they then become heroeslater. They're never heroes in the moment. They'reheroes later on when people reflect on the couragethey showed and the issues that they raised. Andthat is really where we are. Colin Kaepernick, asthe years go on, will be a more and more reveredfigure and frankly, Donald Trump is in danger ofbeing a more and more reviled figure as the yearsgo on. LEMON: Another message, David, from thePresident seems to be that he gets to define whatpatriotism is and who is patriotic. SWERDLICK:That is right, Don. And I think he is made themistake here kind of along the lines of what Vanis saying by casting his view in the way that hedid. There was a point just a week ago where theowners and management in the NFL were a lot closerto the position of the President by castigatingthe players in this way, he has driven the ownerscloser to the players because they -- I think beenable to see that, ok, now when you have theplayers versus the President of the United States,you can see more clearly what the players aretrying to do. The players have said ColinKaepernick has said, his former teammate Eric Reedsaid in  'The New York Times ' this week that theychose kneeling specifically, because they wantedto do a protest in the most respectful waypossible. They didn't stay in the locker room.They didn't turn their backs on the flag. Theycame out for the anthem, but knelt to underscorewhat is the underlying issue here, which is policeviolence and the tension between communities ofcolor and police. But, no, no, go ahead. LEMON:Not to rush you guys along but I want to get totwo things. Why do we play the national anthem ata ball game anyway? Why is that such a big deal?JENNINGS: We play it at a lot of events. I view itas one of the rituals that we all go throughtogether that reminds us that we're all in thistogether. We're all Americans and we're all inthis experience together. But there's an importantset of rituals we go through that sort of give usthat every now and then reminder that, hey, we'reall Americans and what does it mean to be anAmerican? It means we're all in this countrytogether and we're all fighting for the samething, the same freedom, and the same liberty. Ithink when people see what they perceive asdisrespect of those rituals, they have a visceralreaction. Trump has a visceral reaction, a lot ofhis supporters do. According to a CNN poll 90percent of his supporters had the same reactionthat he did. There's a population that don't liketo see people disrespecting the rituals thatreminds us, hey, we're all in this together.LEMON: That is been my whole point. Is that thisPresident has had the chance to elevate andeducate people to realize that just by drapingyourself in the flag is not necessarilypatriotism. That is just a ritual and rituals canbe hollow. Van, when you step back and think aboutall the President has said about the NFL players,and I know that -- is this a white lash againstthe players and the supporters that is what'sresulted here? JONES: If you take a big step back,there's something happening throughout the westthat this politics of resentment, this politics ofkind of finding these dog whistle issues isbecoming a playbook for a certain set ofpoliticians. You saw that happening in Germany,very far right people who made it to parliament inGermany. Playing us against each other. And Ithink the President of the United States is alltoo often guilty of those same kinds of tactics. Ithink that we have forgotten -- we've got of lostthe plot here. Those NFL players, the African-American ones, they say well, they're rich. Theyshould just be grateful. They shouldn't complain.Rich celebrities shouldn't complain. Donald Trumpis a rich celebrity -- LEMON: All the time. JONES:-- and he is been complaining all the time.Apparently it's ok to be a rich celebrity andcomplain. Ask the President. That is how he gotwhere he is. They say they shouldn't raise theseissues, a lot of these guys are two or three yearsout of the hood. Their families still live there.They're getting text messages from cousins. Theygo home to thanksgiving to neighborhoods where ifit was mine or yours or Donald Trump'sneighborhood, they would be screaming and yellingsomething is going terribly wrong. The streetviolence and the police violence. Too muchviolence, too many funerals. They're doing a goodthing for American racist issues. ",

Videosposted on social media show Aldean, one of thebiggest names in the genre, singing as very rapidgunfire begins in the background. He canbe seen running from stage as he, and thethousands in the crowd who came to see him,realized the horror of what was happening.No matter how often these tragedies occur (andit is far too often), one never goes into an eventthinking it will happen then or there. Theterror is unimaginable. In this case, itwas also protracted. A gunmancontinued to rain bullets on the audience forup to two terrifying hours, reports indicate.Victims ran to safety, according to NBC News,during momentary breaks in the violence, at whichpoint the shooter presumably reloaded.  Many were trapped in the venuefor what must have felt like an eternity, butpolice SWAT officers eventually found and killedthe shooter.  He was found on the 32nd floor ofthe Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas MetropolitanPolice Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said, and shotdead.  Right now we believeit's a solo act, a lone wolfattacker,  Lombardo told reporters. We are pretty confident there is no longera threat.  The gunman has not yetbeen identified. Aldean said he was safein an Instagram post early Monday, sharing animage of the city and asking for prayers for thevictims:  Tonight has been beyondhorrific. I still dont know what to say but wantedto let everyone know that Me and my Crew aresafe. '   'My Thoughtsand prayers go out to everyone involvedtonight,  he wrote, clearly as stunned andtraumatized as anyone else.

'Just horrific. Praying foreveryone.  Witness accounts are whatyou would expect - unable to fully do justice towhat happened as you read this, but terrifyingnonetheless. Country star Jake Owen wasone of the witnesses, having just finished his setand was still on stage when the shootingstarted.   I wascrouched down behind a cop car, ' he said.

Authorities, meanwhile,are searching for a 62-year-old woman namedMarylou Danley, whom they believe is thegunman's roommate. Police havesearched a home in Mesquite, Nevada, 85 miles fromLas Vegas, where it is believed the gunman livedwith Danley. She is considered a person ofinterest in the case. UPDATE: Police have identified the assailant asStephen Paddock, 64. He is shown above with hiscompanion, Danley. Paddock is believed tohave begun his attack around 10:00 pm local timeand to have continued shooting for two hours.Police were reportedly able to locate Paddockquickly due to the smoke from his weapon settingoff hotel fire detectors. Paddock'smotives for the shooting remain unclear. Earlyreports indicate that he was not a member of anymilitant group. He was not known to holdextremist political or religious beliefs, thoughthe investigation into the matter is just hoursold. Danley was apprehended forquestioning at 3:40 a.m.  It is not currently known if she's beingtreated as an accomplice in the attack, or whetherlaw enforcement simply wants to learn more.

Email us atTurtleboysports@gmail.com for moreinformation.  Yesterday Worcester CityCouncilor Michael Gaffney wrote a letter toTurtleboy about his disgust towards WorcesterMagazine Editor Walter Bird for the way Bird sexually harasses and tries tohook up with women who he has businessdealings with. But why did CouncilorGaffney wait until now to release this damninginformation? Well, he was probably mad thatButtmunch Billy Shaner, his newest minimum wagereporter, insinuated in the recent copy of theirfree newspaper that Councilor Gaffney subscribed towhite nationalist ideology: YIKES:Quoting a white supremacist is not the best look,especially after one of them rammed a car into agroup of people, killing one and injuring 19. Withthat in mind, I bring you arecent article in the Worcester IndependentLeader by City Councilor At-Large Mike Gaffneyblasting city leadership for policies that favorbig business and development. While I felt thearticle did a fine job portraying his perspective,a friend pointed out something worrying toward thebottom. Just before the last sentence,there's a quote overlaying an imageattributed to Voltaire. The quote reads:  Tolearn who rules over you, simply find out who youare not allowed to criticize.  It is oftenattributed to Voltaire, although it has been disputed as to whether he, in fact, saidit. A prominent and supremely controversialwhite supremacist named Kevin Alfred Strom did,however.. Among other things, Strom has denied theHolocaust, advocated for a Neo-Nazi party andpleaded guilty to child pornography possessioncharge. The quote kind of takes a differentmeaning in proper context, I think. So letme get this straight. Gaffney gives a completelyapplicable quote about the dangers of censoringfree speech, which he and most other peopleattribute to Voltaire \u2013 the philosopherwhose writings most historians agree was a drivingforce in the American Revolution. And what doesBilly do? He goes out of his way to turn this intoGaffney quoting a white supremacist. For therecord, even the far left attributes this quote toVoltaire: So did people in the aftermath ofthe Charlie Hebdo murders:   Voltaire:  'Tolearn who rules over you, simply find out who youare not allowed to criticise ' #JeSuisCharliepic.twitter.com/uAK8KF3C6i\u2014 Sam Sussex (@SamSussex) January 8,2015  So do Palestinians who wantto criticize Israel:  To learn whorules over you, simply find out who you are notallowed to criticize.-Voltaire #GazaUnderAttack pic.twitter.com/k3yt6jzHNH\u2014 Persia (\u0631) (@persiatx) August13, 2014  So did Trump'slucky sperm:  To find out who rulesover you, simply find out who you are not allowedto criticize.Voltaire Donald TrumpJr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) April 25,2013  This is what you get whenyou Google image that quote: In otherwords, everyone thinks Voltaire said this. No oneknows for sure if he did or didn't. All wedo know is that a random white supremacist fromWest Virginia also wrote it here 25 years ago. Soobviously Councilor Gaffney has been brushing upon his 25 year old West Virginia white supremacistliterature. Either that or he, just like manyprogressives and conservatives before him, believethis is a Voltaire quote. Anyone with abrain could see what Buttmunch Billy was trying todo here. He doesn't like Gaffney becausehe's a social justice warrior. He tries toplay if off like he's just  reportingthe news  but he doesn't do a verygood job hiding it. Keep in mind that theTurtlegram and Gazette calledGaffney a  slave master  two yearsago for investigating a fraudulent non-profit thatjust so happened to be run by a black woman. Theyact like it's harmless to throw these labelsout there. It's not. And what I love aboutGaffney is that he's not afraid to fire backat these frauds, which is exactly what he did onhis Facebook page last night: Juicy!!!Walter Bird didn't write the blurb, but hisnewest employee did. I'm sure Walterappreciates Buttmunch Billy dragging him into aworld of shit that is Turtleboy blowback. But whatchoice did Gaffney have? We're the onlymedia outlet in town that tells the truth. Therest are clearly against him, so why should heplace nice with them any longer? Either way,Walter is the editor. He approved of this. Heallowed his newest employee to insinuate that theVice Chairman of the City Council quotes whitesupremacists. Buttmunch Billy quicklyobjected on Gaffney's Facebook page:Yea Mike. He didn't actually call you aracist. He just insinuated that you are inspiredby white supremacist literature and freely quotethem in order to push your agenda in Worcester.What's the harm? YIKES!! Instead ofjust apologizing and admitting he fucked up,Buttmunch Billy doubled down and said that he wasNOT insinuating any racism on his part:Yea dude, no one believes you. You're notgood at lying. You don't go out of your wayto research a meme's origins, and thenattribute it solely to a white supremacist, unlessyou're trying to tie Gaffney to thatparticular white supremacist. We're not asstupid as you are. Plus, who cares?Yea, there's no consequences to beingtied to a controversial white supremacist just acouple days after one of them murdered a womanwith his car. It's not like Joe Petty andhis mindless followers will use that against him.Oh wait\u2026..  Councilor Gaffneyquotes white supremacist. That's the story now. That's how itwill be told from this point forward. ButtmunchBilly knew this, which is why he wrote it in thefirst place. But it's not his fault: It's not on me the way partisanschoose to use my reporting.  See? Hewas just reporting the facts by going out of hisway to suggest that Gaffney quoted a Nazi. Not hisfault how people react to that. Kind of like howpeople like Billy don't blame Trump when hissupporters do fucked up shit. Many accusedhim of racebaiting, but Buttmunch Billy once againdisagreed: Yea, totally not race-baiting.White supremacy has nothing do with race.Then things got even juicier: Busted!!!Apparently Billy was texting Gaffney wanting toknow why a post from one of his trolls named EricMalouin was deleted: Notice the face heforgot to crop out after he screenshotted:That would be fellow Worcester Magazine minimumwage employee  Oh I see now \u2013 it was agroup effort from Worcester Magazine. No wonderGaffney wanted to spill the bins on their boss\u2013 they conspire to make him look bad andthey got caught in the act. Nice going Billy. Sothat means Lyford was watching this all go down,started screenshotting his boy Eric's trollcomments, and then cried about it to ButtmunchBilly when Gaffney blocked him. Because Josh wastoo much of a pussy to confront Gaffney himself.Sad. It looks as if the local African-American community was not impressed with theirrace baiting: Boom. Roasted. OnceGaffney threatened to spill the bins onWalter's sexting scandal, Billy realized hefucked up. He's only been on the job acouple months and his childish vendetta was aboutto lead to the public humiliation of his boss. Sohe was all like,  Why not focus on mybehavior?  Because Walter allowedthis to happen. What you write reflects upon him.When South Shore Turtlegirl offends large groupsof people they go after the brand, not theblogger. We all own it together.It's OK though, because Worcesteria  is irreverent.  Yea, it'sjust a joke Mike!! So I called you a whitesupremacist. Big deal snowflake!!

Email us at [email protected] for moreinformation.  Screen Shot 2015-12-01 at10.29.56 AM  Obviously the big story of the dayis the massacre that occurred in Las Vegas lastnight at a Country Music concert, where at least50 people were killed by a man from a 32nd floorhotel room at Mandalay Bay casino. Naturally thishas already been politicized, with people arguingabout immigration, gun control, and all thingsTrump. Oh and Hillary said this:  Thecrowd fled at the sound of gunshots.Imagine the deaths if the shooter had asilencer, which the NRA wants to make easier toget. Hillary Clinton(@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017 But yea, Trump is the only one who tweetsdumb things. Good thing the democrats gave us aviable alternative in 2016 that we could reallyget behind. Those machine gun silencers are a realkiller. Anyway, we have no interest ingoing all political about this. Maybe Jay Dubwill. Just not my cup of tea. What we do is alwaysfind the worst people on the Internet and see whatthey have to say about this tragedy. Today'swinner is an illiterate drug dealer from Hartfordnamed Allen Lozada, AKA AP El Titere. Here'shis initial reaction to the mass shooting:He might not have finished his GED, but hebasically sees the world the same exact way 99% ofemployees at CNN do \u2013 everything isTrump's fault. And those crackas who werepeacefully watching a concert in Vegas? Theydeserved it. The whole thing was a big setup todraw attention away from hurricane relief inPuerto Rico. He was just getting startedthough: But he's one of the goodguys because he admits to donating his profitsfrom drug transactions towards disasterrelief: Oh yea, he's a winner. Andyou'll never guess who his favorite bouncingball team is\u2026.. There's gonnabe a lot of talk in the days and weeks ahead aboutbanning whatever guns were used in Las Vegas. ButI think we can all agree that what REALLY needs tobe banned are flat brimmed Chicago Bulls hats andanyone who is inclined to wear them. There areplenty of responsible, law abiding gun owners outthere. But there has never, ever, ever been adecent, law-abiding person who has chosen to wearthat thing on their head. If you know anyone thatowns that hat, disassociate with them immediately.They will only bring you down. He evenrocks the Chicago Bulls winter hat when he'spouring out some Henny for the homeys in theJanuary: Easy on the Henny Allen \u2013it's not good for your bowels: Iknow when I die I want people to come to myheadstone and drink copious amounts of Red Bulland Henny, the nectar of the hoodrats. Hereally misses his boy, who I'm sure lived anoble and worthwhile life, because now that Sitoisn't around, he doesn't have anyoneto come scoop him up to he can  turn up onthese fuck n words : You can alsofind Allen Lozada on Deadbeatdirectory.com, withhis own profile: Oh good, he's acokehead deadbeat  dad,  who allegedlythreatened to choke his baby until she turnedblue. Shocking. Especially considering his overallphilosophy on women: When he eventuallygets killed by a cop and SJWs pretend like hisdeath is an actual loss to the community, he wantsyou to commemorate him by burning Hartford to theground: He's very familiar with theinside of a courthouse: He lives the goodlife by cashing in his SSI check for stays at theMarriott: Last year things were beginningto look up for Allen. He was trying to stay out ofthe police logs, and gave himself one Internetcookie for going a full month without stabbing,shooting, or running over someone with a car:He gets another Internet cookie for going fourdays sober: And he's going legitbecause the  feds out here snatchingeverybody : Also this: Ihave no idea what that means, but it soundsimportant. VERY important. Anyway, it isgonna be interesting to see what thekiller's motivation was in Las Vegas. Heshot at a country music festival. A place thatmore than likely was filled with people who votedfor Donald Trump. Not saying that's hismotive, but he could've shot up any largegroup of people and he chose this one. Justsayin. Either way, Allen Lozada is auseless sack of gutterpubes, and the 50+ who diedin Las Vegas are much, much bigger losses tosociety than he could ever be.

For the first time evertoday two junkboxes messaged the Turtleboybusiness page to ask if we hadXanax for sale.One of them was Jessica Kane,who according to her Facebook page lives inPawtucket, but she insists she lives inSmithfield, RI. Odds are she knows her way aroundthe Bucket though, and could probably tell youwhich corners yield the highest dividends. Justsayin. Anyway, she reached out to us looking forzannies: But Jessica Kane was just warmingup. Because it wasn't enough to message ablog that frequently shames junkboxes andratchets, looking for drugs, she had to take onturtle riders too\u2026\u2026. I'll beat ur ass corn. That's a new one. As you can seeshe is alleging that we are the ones who solicitedher to see if she wanted to buy drugs off us. Yagot that? This is what Turtleboys do every day. Wescour the Internet looking for junkboxes to sellour excess zannies to. Definitely.Anyway, turns out she doesn't have a drugproblem, her  job  just doesn'toffer health insurance. Naturally then her onlyrecourse was to message Turtleboy and see what hewas charging. She can't affordhealth insurance, but cash money sure ain'ta problem: That right there is a lot ofmushroom tip participation trophies!! Asyou can see, she's sticking to her storythat we messaged her first, which obviously makesTONS of sense. She kept posting ascreenshot showing what appears to be uscontacting her first, asking if she was lookingfor zannies. She just forgot that in the very blogshe was commenting on anyone could clearly seethat she was the one who initiated contact:Oops!! After that it was time to bustout the CAPS LOCK!! Thirteen years is along time to be prescribed Xanax. And by prescribed  she means,  treatedDiego to a basket lunch in exchange for illegalnarcotics.  Up next was the I'll fuck everyone up  portionof the Gospel of Ratchet: Yea guys,she's totally not a junkie. She just sohappens to message random community Facebook pageslooking to score drugs. And occasionally she getsbusted with crackcocaine: Besides that she'stotally NOT a junkie. But it's all good inthe hood because she got that shit dismissed!!Therefore she never got caught with crackcocaine. (P.S. turtle riders are savage)Next up in the ratchet script was the threat tocall the cops: So if you're keepingscore at home, this woman approached us aboutbuying drugs, admitted to the cops that she didso, and the cops responded by turning their focuson cyberbullying. Because NOTHING IS MORE SERIOUSTHAN CYBERBULLYING, EVEN ADDICTION!! Youcan't make this stuff up. Only on Turtleboy.This is why we are the greatest blog that'sever existed. Good luck finding this sort ofentertainment at Barstool. But her storychecks out because her uncle is the chief ofpolice: We just don't know what townhe's the chief of police in. Wherever he is,I'm sure her imaginary uncle would bethrilled to find his junkie niece name droppinghim on Turtleboy. But wait, it getsbetter. Last year she made headlines whenshe was getting her biweekly free ambulance rideto the ER when she claimed she was abused by oneof the first responders. And in one of thegreatest MSM fails of all time, NCB Investigative  Team fell for her act hook,line, and sinker: That interview wasamazing. She literally puts on a blazer and somenon-prescription glasses and the schmucks on this I-Team  just assume she's alaw-abiding non-ratchet member of society.A local woman turned to the NBC 10 I-Team foranswers after she captured a confrontation insidea North Providence ambulance on cell phone video.The video shows an EMT lashing out at her,appearing to slap her in the face and swearing ather several times.  He then smackedme across my face,  Jessica Kane said of theJuly 30 incident. North Providenceofficers were responding to a domestic disturbancecall when they came into contact with Kane, who isepileptic. A police report obtained by NBC 10shows the officers saw her have a seizure and loseconsciousness. They called the North ProvidenceFire Department for medical aid, and an ambulancearrived a short time later.  As soonas I was put into the rescue, I was called a drugaddict, which I am not,  she said.  Iwas just belittled so much. It made me feel likethe people here to treat me were there to justaccuse me.  Oh yea, she'sTOTALLY not a drug addict. She's just beenarrested for crack cocaine and messages randomFacebook pages with 99,000 followers to see ifthey can sell her Xanax. Oh, and her raspy life kicked the shit out of me andI'm only 26  voice wasn't a deadgiveaway or anything like that. The videoshows the EMT appear to slap Kane in the face,causing her to drop her phone. That's assault!  she screamson the tape.  I'll give youassault!  the man responds. Watchthe video if you haven't already.She's all fucked up and aggressive and istaping the guy who probably knows her middle name,date of birth, and blood type because he dealswith her so often. She won't shut the fuckup and approaches him while taping. She gets tooclose. He pushes her away from him.Assault. That's how stupid theNBC 10  I-Team  is. Theunidentified EMT can also be heard telling Kane to shut the (expletive) up.  She saidthe verbal abuse continued once she arrived at thehospital, moments not captured in the video. He said, \u2018If you don't get theF up off this stretcher, I'm going to ripyou by your hair,'  Kane told NBC10. Funny that none of that is on thetape. Guess we'll just have to take thiscrackbunny's word for it. NBC 10also reviewed the police report from officers whoarrived that day. They noted that Kane wasdifficult to deal with, writing that, Jessica was yelling and screaming in themiddle of the road  and was  extremelybelligerent.  The police report continues,saying that Kane  became hostile, trying tounbuckle herself and get off thestretcher.  Boom. Mysterysolved. Kane was released after spendingabout five hours at Fatima Hospital, and her cellphone was returned. That's when she said shefound the video she recorded in the ambulance inher iPhone's  Recently Deleted folder. She believes someone tried to erase itwhile the phone was out of her control.  Iactually received my phone back and I saw thatthey tried to delete the video,  shesaid. Oh yea, I'm sure that'swhat happened. Why would she lie? She'swearing a blazer and glasses!! Kane hiredan attorney and said she plans to file an assaultcomplaint with Rhode Island State Police. As ofWednesday, state police said they had not yetreceived the complaint or been contacted by Kaneabout the incident. Translation \u2013she called up Dick N. Vulva, never paid him, gothigh, and never followed through with her massivelawsuit. Anyway, we were still confusedhow the hell Jessica Kane got the impression thatwe were zanny salesmen. Turns out there was awhole background story: You can'tmake this shit up. In August we blogged about thisLawrence ghettopoon sellingXanax on Facebook: Evidently JessicaKane read the headline of this blog, assumed thatwe were the ones selling zannies, waited until shegot her check on the first of the month, and thenhit us up for the hookup. Just another dayat Turtleboy. Shit like this never gets old. Ilove my job way too much. One guy suggested thatit was a slow week: Dude, not one, but twojunkbunnies messaged us assuming we sell Xanaxfrom our Facebook page. If you don't thinkthat's getting blogged about then youdon't know Turtleboy. Exactly!!Someone gets it! From now on I think thisis what you people should start doing:Brilliant.

Email us atTurtleboysports@gmail.com for moreinformation.  Trashlive: Hours after a32-year-old woman from Western Massachusettsfatally overdosed in Rhode Island on Monday, herfather and brother were arrested in what policeare calling a kidnapping and attack on hersuspected heroin hookup. Police arrived on BaldwinHill Road in the small Berkshire County town ofEgremont around 4:15 p.m. to find the latewoman's father allegedly choking andstriking a struggling man while his son helpedhold down his arms. Both father and son were screaming different versions of \u2018youkilled my [expletive] daughter' and\u2018you killed my [expletive] sister,' according to a report by Egremont Police OfficerHans Carlson, obtained Friday by MassLive.The man was able to escape the slow-moving vanon Baldwin Hill Road, whereupon both Lombardisallegedly followed him out and continued theattack, which residents of the street observed andreported to police, who intervened in a quickresponse. I don't normally condonevigilantism, but at the same time, we'reliving in a state filled to the brim with DevalPatrick judges that let scumbags out onto thestreet time and time again. Some times you justgotta do what you gotta do. Nah mean? Big shoutoutto this father and son duo who realized that thiswas the only way they were going to receive anysort of satisfaction. There's no waythe idiot they kidnapped ever saw it comingeither. There's a reason it was just the sonthat was supposed to show up. The Dad looks likehe done killed 4-5 people before. Plus hisname is Ralph. I don't fuck with guys namedRalph who wear shirts like that. That's justcommon sense. Meanwhile the son appears tobe your average Berkshire hippie jock who is nostranger to craft beer festivals: Never ina million years did the  victim  thinkthat guy right there was gonna kidnap him in a vanand waterboard him to kingdom come until he namednames. I've said it before andI'll say it again \u2013 there is no onemore gutless than a heroin dealer. Pot dealers aregreat, and coke dealers I don't have strongopinions on. Know why? Because they do their ownproduct. Heroin dealers don't. Becausethey'd be dead pretty quickly. If youcan't stand by your product thenyou're a piece of shit. People who sellheroin are choad monkeys because they KNOWthey're profiting off of the self-destruction of another person. There has never,ever, ever been a positive affect of heroin. Ever.You are selling poison to stupid and vulnerablepeople who don't know any better. You arethe lowest of the low. Granted the guythey kicked the shit out of wasn't theactual dealer. But he knew who the dealer was andit was time to name names. This is the only way toget that information. Big props for doing it mafiastyle too by using a van, and telling the idiotthey picked up that they were gonna magically fixhis debt problems. The only surprisingpart about this story is that they got caught inEgremont. Egremont is easily top 5 places to dumpa body in Massachusetts. Ever been there before?It's a real trip. Nestled next to Alford,Mount Washington (there's a town calledMount Washington), New York state, and themetropolis of Great Barrington, there's noreason for anyone to ever go to Egremont. Ever.The fact that this nudnik jumped out of the vanand people were actually there to see it isnothing less than a statistical miracle. Idon't wanna say that father and son areheroes, but they kind of just revolutionized theopiate epidemic. If you sell heroin, you no longerget a free pass from some SJW judge. You get oldschool punishment from the family. At least thatmight present a detriment for potential dealersdown the road. We urge you to support thefollowing local businesses.

Email us atTurtleboysports@gmail.com for moreinformation.  Earlier today we bloggedabout the Uxbridge Fresh Princeof Bad Hair, who thought it would be wise toshoot a cop car with a BB gun, and then shoot anautistic man the next day. Wecouldn't find his Facebook page, but withinan hour we had a million people pointing us to hisUxbridge street name \u2013 Tre Patterson: As youcan see, we're dealing with a real winnerhere. Turns out this 19 year old is STILLIN HIGH SCHOOL!! I shit you not. That's whythe two others he was with aren't havingtheir names released \u2013 because they'rehis minor friends from high school. He tells kidsin his peer group what things were like back in my day.  This yearTre, who recently moved here from  downsouth,  and claims to have enrolled atUxbridge High School because the coach at UConntold him it would help him get recruited, wassuspended multiple times. One of the incidentshappened when he got the school put on lock downbecause he had beef with kids from another schoolon snapchat, and he claimed he had a gun onsnapchat, DURING SCHOOL HOURS, and the other kidswere coming to UHS with more guns. After beinguncooperative with the principals AND the copsabout it, he was escorted off the premises andsuspended. Not expelled- just suspended. BecauseI'm sure when he came back he had a newfoundthirst for knowledge and a desire to follow schoolrules. He also was on the basketball andfootball teams, but hardly ever played because hisgrades weren't good enough. It's hardpassing college prep math when you're only19 years old. So much for UConn. Here heis all dolled up for the first of many juniorproms to come for Tre-Tre: Of coursehe's the cool kid because he can legally buybooze in Canada and no one else can:Don't worry though, the fam is holding itdown on Facebook and has gone full free myboi! Apparently his response to the copsafter he shot the autistic man was that he didn't know he had autism. Because it's OK to shoot people with BB gunsin public as long as they're not autistic.Oh, and autistic people all have tattoos on theirforehead that let them know they'reautistic. That's literally the thoughprocess of this nudnik. Anyway, this isyet another example of the failed educationalpolicies from our state and federal government.This is what happens when administrators valuetheir graduation rates more than the well-being ofthe entire school \u2013 they keep shitheads likethis in school instead of expelling them. Becauseit looks better on a chart if they have lessdropouts. Oh, and don't forget that schoolsall have mandates from the federal government, dueto Arne Duncan's reign of terror, to reducesuspension rates, particularly for students ofcolor. So now schools like Uxbridge are forced tokeep morons like this, who obviously have nointention of learning, enrolled in schools. Theymake it impossible for teachers to do their joband they poison the rest of the student body withtheir bullshit. Uxbridge High School lost anentire day of learning because of him. If somehowhe graduates this year he'll be 20 when hedoes so. And it will only be the result of socialpromotion, fueled by a desire for bettercharts.

According to data releasedby the Florida Department of State'sDivision of Elections, 6.4 million Floridiansvoted early this year. In the end, the Democratswere able to come away from early voting with theadvantage. A total of 2,558,000 votes were cast byregistered Democrats, and 2,471,000 votes werecast by registered Republicans. This translatesinto 39.85 percent of the vote going to theDemocrats, and 38.49 percent of it going to theRepublicans. In total, 49.7 percent of thestate's entire population of registeredvoters have already voted. This turnout of 6.4million voters is a significant increase comparedto four years ago, when only 4.4 million votes werecast early. The Democrats hold a leadgoing into Election Day, but their lead issignificantly smaller than it was four years ago.In 2012, Democrats scored 43 percent of the earlyvote in Florida, and Republicans scored 40percent. In the end, Barack Obama won Florida, butit was a tight race, with the president defeatingMitt Romney by a margin of just 0.88 percentagepoints. Democratic turnout tends to be high inearly voting, and Republican turnout tends to behigh on Election Day. So the fact that theDemocrats don't have as large a lead as theydid four years ago may spell trouble for HillaryClinton. This year, about 1.2 million ofthe ballots cast came from those not affiliatedwith any of the two major parties. This translatesinto 19.2 percent of the early vote. It'sunclear who these voters selected, but many pollshave suggested that they tend to gravitate towardsDonald Trump. In a recentCBS News poll, independent voters favoredDonald Trump over Hillary Clinton, 47 percent to34 percent, and another RemingtonResearch survey showed Trump winning amongunaffiliated voters 49 percent to 36 percent.Although the number of votes cast by Democratsis down, good news for Hillary Clinton is the factthat Hispanic turnout in Florida is up this year.According to TheWall Street Journal, about twice as manyFlorida Hispanics have voted early compared to2012. However, African American turnout was down11 percent this year, according to McClatchy DC.Join over 240,000 people who get the mostimportant news stories and the best shopping dealsfrom Heavy \u2013 Delivered right to yourinbox.",

Donald Trumpwent into this election night being seen as havingno real shot at the White House, with manyDemocrats not even expecting the race to beremotely close. Trump has pulled off what willlikely go down as the most shocking politicalupset in history, and the election result provednearly every single poll and electoral projectionwrong. In fact, it seemed for a while thateven Donald Trump himself wasn't sure thathe was going to win the election. After all, whenhe was asked during the presidential debatewhether he would concede to Hillary Clinton if heloses, Trump refused to committo doing so, saying,  I'll keepyou in suspense  seemingly because part ofhim doubted he could pull this thing off.Obviously, conceding to Hillary Clinton is nolonger an issue. So what will Trump say inhis speech tonight? Both supporters and detractorsalike are hoping for the new president to start toheal the divide after an incredibly heated andcontentious election cycle. It's alsounknown how Donald Trump may address HillaryClinton, his opponent who he has repeatedly saidshould be in jail.

However, journalist JoanWalsh cautioned Americans to take a long, hardlook at Trump's would-be successor MikePence before we get excited about Pence beingbehind the Resolute desk in place of Trump.Wrote Walsh in an article bluntly titled Why Mike Pence is Worse than DonaldTrump  in The Nation,  You probablyhave these debates with your friends, too: Do wewant Donald Trump to resign, or be impeached,which would leave us with Vice President MikePence in charge?\u2026Would the low-charismaPence, who looks like a B-movie producer'sidea of a president, be easier to defeat,especially given the GOP fratricide that wouldcommence with Trump's departure, however itcame about?  She continued,  I trynever to care about the political implications ofwhether Trump should stay or go. He should go,because he's a racist authoritarian who gothelp from a foreign adversary to become president.He should go, because he's more likely tostumble into war than Pence is. But I never letthat obscure the truth, either: Pence is a farworse person, because of his creepyHandmaid's Tale patriarchal approach towomen's equality. But also because heusually knows he's lying about Trump, andtheir administration's agenda, and he liesanyway.  Walsh then brought updisturbing comments the vice president made thispast week during an appearance on the Today show.Said Pence, protesting the removal of Confederatemonuments,  When I walked, back in 2010,across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis,arm in arm, and we remembered Bloody Sunday, andthe extraordinary progress of the civil rightsmovement, I can't help but think that ratherthan pulling down monuments, as some are wont todo, rather than tearing down monuments that havegraced our cities all across this country foryears, we ought to be building moremonuments. Commented Joan about Pence, I don't think he gives a damn aboutthe folks who protest these shameful statues. Whatwas most galling about Pence's comment,though, was that he used his bond with Lewis toclean up Trump's despicable equation ofNazis and white supremacists with their opponents,who are the modern-day incarnation of JohnLewis.

He said that  Thisis a great opportunity to step back and remindourselves and the American people of the oath wetake as members of the military. Goldfein said that the oath they too and theyalways retake every time they were promoted was todefend and support the American Constitutionagainst any enemy both in the domestic and foreignarena. By design, these military officers do notpledge to defend or support any leader or partybecause they are apolitical. The military is nottoo friendly with the president according toGoldfein, one day; the military may be protectingthe people from Trump. Goldfein indirectlycriticized the disastrous raid in Yemen authorizedby Trump, the assurance of Trump that the SEAL wasgoing to have a field only pointed out that he wasa local fish without the experience of swimming inthe international waters. One of thethings that Goldfein is proud of is the fact thatthe military cannot lose sight that they go to warwith their values. People who are critical of theefforts that the military undertakes each day tostop causalities are not aware of who the militaryare. Indeed, Goldfein is a true patriot whodefends the real values of American. We are happywith the service that he is offering passionatelyto our country to ensure that our ideals aremaintained.

However, space, plenty ofcuddles, and an excess of love have resulted inB.B. slowly understanding that her life before wasanything but normal.   She runsaround the house,  said Tortoreo. She's eating like crazy shewas originally about 3 and a half pounds, but Ithink she's maybe about 10 pounds now. Sheloves the grass now, and she loves playing withthe other dogs in the backyard.

Ina television interview broadcast onIreland's \u2018'Late LateShow'', former Secretary of State andDemocratic presidential candidate, HillaryClinton, opened up on the unfolding of events onelection night 2016. Promoting hercampaign memoir, \u2018What Happened',Clinton described the night and its aftermath as\u2018'painful'' and\u2018'so terrible''.\u2018'I would have to go lie downbecause it was so excruciating'', shejoked to interviewer Ryan Tubridy in a candidconversation, filmed near her home in Chappaqua,New York.  I was in a state ofshock. I had not prepared a concessionspeech,  the former presidential candidaterevealed, explaining that whilst expecting a closeresult, her campaign remained confident of victoryup until early election night returns began tosuggest otherwise. Following a final rallyin Philadelphia, appearing with then president,Barack Obama, husband Bill Clinton and celebritiesincluding Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, Clintonrecalled that on the eve of polling day\u2018'everyone was soconfident.'' [Donald Trump,meanwhile, was predicting a \u2018'greatvictory'' as he campaigned inScranton, PA on the same day.\u2018'We are just one day away from thechange you've been waiting for, for yourentire life'', he told supporters onhis final day of campaigning]. Whilstdiscussing the inauguration of President Trump,asked if she wanted to scream, Clinton toldRT\u00c9,  Oh, I did. But that was a commonoccurrence in those days. You know, scream intothe pillow when I saw what washappening.   I would have beendisappointed and really unhappy if I had lost to anormal Republican. But to lose to someone who Ibelieved profoundly was not ready for the job, wastemperamentally unqualified for the job \u2013was such a burden. \u2018'I justthought, \u2018I've let everybody down,I've let my country down, I've let theworld down. How did this happen?  Clintonrecalled. Acknowledging the role of theemail scandal and various shortcomings in hercampaign, Clinton also blamed Russian president,Vladimir Putin, and the propagation of\u2018'fake news'' as factorsin the election of President Trump. I knew there were these other forces atwork that needed to be unpacked and analyzed.It's not only about what happened,it's about preventing it from happeningagain,  she added. With links toIreland since her involvement in the NorthernIreland peace process of the 1990s, Clinton, who\u2018'segued from imposingpolitical figure to slightly wackygrandma'' according to onereviewer, told Ireland's RT\u00c9 Televisionthat she was not going to let the experience turnher \u2018'bitter and cynical''and that she would use her platform to fightagainst what she saw as \u2018'politicallydamaging'' trends emerging in theUS.

The statement,released by his representative, continued, Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed thatthere were never any acts of retaliation againstany women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinsteinobviously can't speak to anonymousallegations, but with respect to any women whohave made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinsteinbelieves that all of these relationships wereconsensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling,has listened to the community and is pursuing abetter path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if hemakes enough progress, he will be given a secondchance. ",

Hollywood's politics havealways been a self-serving charade, a liberalmasquerade for a rapacious and lubriciouslifestyle. But now, thanks to the Weinsteinscandal, we see it more clearly than ever. And itcouldn't be more repellent. (I had always thoughtBill Clinton would have made the greatest studioexecutive of all time. Now I'm convinced ofit.) If conservative investors had anycourage, this would be the time to make a hostiletakeover of the movie business. Unfortunately,they don't. I know this from bitter personalexperience. Wealthy conservatives are delighted tosupport the Philharmonic, but when it comes topopular culture they turn away, as if afraid toget their hands dirty. That this is a hugemistake should be obvious. They have abandoned theculture -- and our children -- to the creepiestpeople imaginable. What is going on in Hollywoodis far from being just about Harvey. It'sapproaching a pandemic. So many previously silentassaulted or raped women are coming out of thewoodwork, it seems like a long-belated remake of Cheaper by the Dozen.  No one knowswho will be next or if it will stop at Harvey.The rot is everywhere, even, perhapsespecially, in the precincts of  highart.  Gwyneth Paltrow says now is the timeto put an end to these attacks on women. But wherewas she years ago when Harvey got handsy  with her? Looking the otherway while earning millions and garnering Oscars.Meryl Streep claimed she was clueless aboutWeinstein's repulsive antics. Time to awardher her greatest Oscar yet -- for playing someonedeaf, dumb, and blind while living as a troglodytein the Gobi desert. Either the woman's aliar or an utter nincompoop. I'll go withthe former. As for the great feministGeorge Clooney -- the first male star out of thebox to condemn Weinstein's behavior --let's give him the Nobel Prize in virtuesignaling. By coming forward, he was able to aceout his competition -- Howard Zinn-loving MattDamon, who disgraced himself forever by coveringup for Harvey a decade ago. (For those who mayhave missed it in the onslaught of sleazy details,Damon assured then New York Times reporter SharonWaxman that Miramax's high-paid Italianrepresentative was a genuine  creative filmexecutive  and not Harvey's Europeanprocurer, as was, evidently correctly, rumored.Damon is the same  progressive  moviestar who makes films opposing school choice forthe masses while living in a thirty million dollarhouse and sending his kids to private school.

CNNhas an estimate just for the planealone:  According to the Air Force,flying a C-32, the model of plane used for AirForce 2, for one hour costs about $30,000. Pence'sflight from Las Vegas to Indianapolis Saturdaytook about three hours and 20 minutes, so it costabout $100,000. Pence then flew fromIndianapolis to Los Angeles on Sunday, which tookabout four hours and 45 minutes, costing about$142,500. The grand total: about$242,500.  Keep in mind this is justfor the plane. It does not include any of theancillary costs that accrue anytime the vicepresident travels anywhere. There were increasedsecurity costs to local police once Pence was onthe ground in Indianapolis. Costs to locals stuckin traffic as roads were likely closed for hismotorcade. Costs to the Colts to increase securityat the stadium. And so on. All so Pencecould release a statement that was the equivalentof his infamous stern gazeacross the Demilitarized Zone at North Korea: I left today's Colts game because PresidentTrump and I will not dignify any event thatdisrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or ourNational Anthem. At a time when so many Americansare inspiring our nation with their courage,resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, weshould rally around our Flag and everything thatunites us. While everyone is entitled to their ownopinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFLplayers to respect the Flag and our NationalAnthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand withour soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flagand our National Anthem.  Pence'soffice would like you to think this was just aspontaneous reaction by a man proud of his flagand his nation. This is belied by the fact thathis reporters traveling with him were not allowed out of theirvans when they arrived at the Colts' stadium butwere told ahead of time that  there may bean early departure from the game byVPOTUS.  It is also belied by thistweet sent Sunday afternoon by Donald Trump: I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium ifany players kneeled, disrespecting our country. Iam proud of him and @SecondLady Karen. The Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers,the former team of Colin Kaepernick, who startedthe kneeling protests a year ago. The chances thatMike Pence would see players kneeling wereapproximately 100 percent. He knew thisahead of time, yet he still chose to fly from LasVegas to Indianapolis despite the fact that he hadto fly back to California immediately afterwardsfor fundraisers, just so he could get a picture ofhimself holding his hand over his heart (a picturehis staff immediately made the header photo on hisTwitter page) before theatrically storming out andscolding the NFL players for offending him.A real leader might have tried to find outexactly why the players startedkneeling in the first place, which was toprotest police brutality and racism, and then spoken withthem and tried to figure out ways to address theirconcerns. Mike Pence did the exactopposite. As of Monday morning, he has yetto make a peep about the white nationalistsreturning to Charlottesville, Virginia, onSaturday night to once again rally around theRobert E. Lee statue there. That he is seeminglyfar more concerned with staging a political stuntslapping down African-American players protestingsystemic racism tells you all you need to knowabout him.
