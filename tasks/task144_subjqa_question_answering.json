My friend wasn't too excited by the chicken but the sauce was too yummy to complain about. We topped the meal off with the mango and sticky rice which was absolutely divine.

The decor is fun, old-fashioned and trendy all at the same time. Breakfast in Cafe Andree downstairs was tasty and the service was fast. Great location, convenient to Union Square and whatever city amenities you need. Valet parking was responsive to whenever we needed our car. Best of all was the pug dog Max, who lounged on one of the chairs in the reception area while his owner worked the desk.

Ms Flynn has a terrific ability for description and development of very interesting characters.  She puts you right there in the middle of the story. I couldn't put it down.  It has twists and turns and a double ending. As much as I enjoyed this book, there was much dark and depressing elements of the story that I cannot forget.  I'll wait awhile before I read Dark Places, the only other novel I have left to read that she has written. It's not that I don't want to read it. I just want go save it and let the novel just finished digest a bit.  Actually looking forward to Dark Places. Hoping she will have another novel published soon. She is one writer that I intend to keep reading. I did read Gone Girl last year and loved it. But somehow it did not have the same kind of experience for me. It was a great novel but very different . Highly recommend this if you like real psychological thrillers. And some parts require a strong stomach. But so filled with dysfunction and disordered lives that are wonderfully written, no matter how difficult it may be to read. It is a unique kind of book. Not for children and adolescents in my opinion. Some very heavy material and necessary but ugly descriptions of things better left for mature adults.

I only wish the restaurant was slightly less popular so that it wouldn't be so hard to get a seat! House wine (red or white) is just $1 per ounce, and you can order at any increments. The alcoholic demon inside of me is leaping in excitement!Now onto the food!Polipo ($14.50) - Grilled octopus, chimichurri, olive tapenade, piquillo puree, arugula and fried capers. I'm not always a fan of grilled octopus, but this one was done well. The exterior was marvelously charred in the most delicious way, and the octopus itself was quite tender. Bruschetta Guanciale e Taleggio ($10.95). Overall, I found this bruschetta to be a little salty, and I needed something to offset that salt.Arancini ($9.95) - wild mushroom risotto, fontina cheese, tomato sauce. These risotto balls are practically $5 each so I found that a little pricey. Aside from that, I did enjoy the arancini a lot, especially when they were served piping hot.Lasagne ($17.95) heirloom tomato, wild mushroom, italian eggplant, yellow zucchini, kale butter. We visited on a Sunday and luckily for us, lasgane was the special for the day! This was a very solid effort- the pasta layers were thin and delicate, so overall the dish didn't feel overly heavy, as lasagne often do. The sauce was also delectable and there were no complaints at the table. Mushroom fettuccine ai funghi ($17.50) - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle paste,  light cream sauce. Hands down, one of my favourite pastas in town. I am particularly fond of mushroom pasta, but this was one of the best I've had! The al dente pasta was perfect for soaking up all the deep, earthy flavours of the mushrooms. This is a must try!Overall, the food was amazing, the atmosphere is lovely and you really can't beat $1 per ounce wine on tap! I will be back for sure.\nquestion: How amazing was the patio?",

Good vibe, neon décor, online reservations, delicious tapa style dishes and a menu of tequila tastings.What we ate (after the complimentary bucket of corn chips): Food:1. Guacamole dip - $11 for a regular (6/10)  - hard to do guac wrong but nothing to write home about, get it if you want an excuse to eat more corn chips2. Sopes de tinga $15 (5/10)- this appetizer was unique but the fried, breaded cheese tart overpowered the taste of the chicken3. Tuna Ceviche $11 (7/10) - fresh ahi tuna in a fantastic fusion of mango and cilantro, wanted another one because the portion size was not meant to be shared4. Pulpo carnita $16 (8/10) - well cooked confit of octopus, not too chewy or dry, exactly what you expect from a well cooked octopus5. Carrillera en mole negro $15 (6/10)- extremely tender, 24 hour braised beef cheek - however the tar looking sauce definitely requires an appreciative pallet Drinks: 1. Mojito Reposada $10 glass  -perfect concoction of Milagro Resposado, muddled mint, and fresh lime - not usually a mojito drinker as I find they're often too sweet or the tequila is overpowering, but this was simply delicious2. Tequilla tasting: Vertical Flight 1.3 oz - $19 -  Avion Silver / Avion Reposado / Avion Anejo - fun addition to the meal, however I'm by no means refined in the art of tequila tasting - all I can say is that they were smooth and worth the order3. Tequilla tasting #2 - Barrel Aged Horizontal Flight - $22 - Tromba Anejo / Avion Anejo / Cazadores Anejo- ditto to my comment above - although I enjoyed this tasting a bit more as I found the tequila to be bolder and the neutralizing sides added some spiceRating Summary: Food: Average of 7/10 for the main courses as noted aboveAtmosphere: 9/10. Fun, posh Mexican vibe - definitely feeling the vibrant décor and music Service: 9/10. The Spanish speaking servers add to the atmosphere. Our server had his corn chip service in check; our chip bucket was never empty. Service was difficult at times to wave down and we would've liked the staff to be more educated in the tequila being served. Pulling out my phone to take photos would have been a date faux pas, hence no photos to share in this post. Will definitely come back during patio season!\nquestion: Would you say that the decoration is gorgeous?",

            "input": "review: Miku has been floating around in my bookmarks for years. It was always a combination of too expensive and too inconvenient that made it a faraway dream. But I took advantage of Winterlicious 2018 to finally give in. Ok. I get it now. I finally see the light.I was surprised to find out that Miku was as fusion-y as it was. You don't get a lot of quality Asian fusion places, especially ones that do sushi/sashimi with the same high standards as really good Japanese restaurants in the city. They've got an extensive alcohol list and unique cocktails for the adventurous. I got the non-alcoholic Ginger Basil Smash, which was a little sour, a little sweet, and very smashing indeed. Despite the higher end dinner price tag of $53, I still believe Miku is one of the best Winterlicious offers out there. Firstly, $53 for a QUALITY 3-course meal is pretty damn good. Don't believe me? Let's break it down: 1) Aburi Sampler Platter - (6 pcs, originally $18) - How special can torched sushi be? Apparently, really special when it comes to Miku. The flavour was stronger than any other Aburi sushi I've had. I contemplated getting more of the torched salmon at regular prices, but I was too full by the end. 2) Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin and Pan Seared Foie Gras Rouge - Not from the regular menu, this was a piece of Winterlicious originality. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, even the brussel sprouts. I can say for certain though that my first bite into the foie gras was the best, most orgasmic bite of the entire meal. It's also pure fatty goose liver goodness so even though you only get 3 small medallions of beef tenderloin, everything together made me quite full. 3) Green Tea Opera - (originally $14.5) - I was more than happy to see their signature dessert on the menu. It's really something special. Rich green tea mousse with crunchy hazelnuts. Served with a tiny scoop of fragrant house-made green tea ice cream. My fiancé had the Japanese Tiramisu. Tasty, but we both agreed the opera was better. Given the prices of the appetizer and dessert, that puts the beef and foie gras dish at $20! Sometimes, you can't even get a liver pâté dish at that price, let alone a whole piece of foie gras. On top of that, everything was cooked and flavoured to perfection. The prices might be high, but I think the talent behind the cooking justifies it. Quality over quantity makes Miku my Winterlicious winner. Now if only I could get a reservation at Canoe...(10/100) - 2018\nquestion: Was the decoration good?",

We wanted to get a place around here and come here all the time. Then we broke up. Now there are way too many memories and I haven't been coming around as much. I also don't live as close.It is totally full on a Friday or Saturday night; anticipate a 20 minute wait after 8pm. Made my ex try poutine here. He didn't like it, and thought gravy was terrible too mix with cheese curds and fries but it was a solid, savoury, melty poutine and not too drenched in gravy. However, its not really a thick-cut like Poutini's.Drink prices have gone up by 50cents or a dollar, but that's concurrent with price inflation all over the world. This is a reliable location for wifi, as Green Beanery doesn't have it and a sign on their door says they have a regular thief right now. (and still. REALLY, Toronto?)It's nice to come here for working on your laptop or to throw a drink back before ambling over to Altima for an ominous dental cleaning. It's also great for a friends date and one drink easily turns into two. Because of how close the cubby lounge chair-table units are... you will overhear a lot of OKCupid dates going on and that can be quite hilarious.Now onto the good: coffee and alcohol. The coffee is always strong, they make a firm cappuccino. The craft cocktails are an economic and easy buzz. Ask for the secret hidden vintage cocktail menu that's only on 15 menus in the whole place. These drinks are both potent and delicious... But not too sweet. If you like bitter I recommend the sazerac or corpse reviver#2, if you like sour then paper airplane or pisco sour.

We like watching Top Chef and we're super foodies - so we thought why not!WHAT A MISTAKE! We got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday and the host looked like someone had threatened him with a sawed off shot gun! We realized it's probably a busy place but it seemed even worse than that. We knew we had no chance of getting a table so we hit the bar for some cocktails and appetizers. The place only got more zoo crazy after that - it was like watching a horror film.LOADS of people crammed in trying to get a table - the host often all together DISAPPEARING! (This was funny to watch from the bar in a sick way) From chic to geek tons of people tried to jam in there. I was glad we had a little bar table and thinking this was a genius move! We had beer and champagne by the glass cause the cocktails were just outright ridiculously priced. The decor was unique and cool- very east meets west. And to my surprise Susur Lee was there darting in and out of the kitchen, greeting tables, and SEEMINGLY terrorizing the staff! We watched as staff would go out of their way to not get near him - go around the whole dining room almost in a way just to avoid him. He smiled when meeting guests and taking pictures but at all other times seemed pissed. I thought it might be cool to try and get a photo with him before we left BUT then we had some of the appetizers and I decided IT WAS A WASTE OF ANYMORE TIME - CAUSE THE FOOD WAS AWFUL!We tried SUSUR'S FAVORITES PEDESTAL which consisted of:EDAMAME = Always tasty YET I could make this at home  WHIPPED CHICKPEA DIP = Flavorful but could have easily been surpased by a gourmet store dip SALMON CEVICHE = only OK - not memorable or unique PEKING DUCK ROLLS = only good thing on the plate (probably cause it's fried?!)  HUNAN CHICKEN WINGS = a total joke CHEESEBURGER SPRING ROLLS = HORRIBLE! Tasted strange and as if one too many herbs were in the mix.After having a Cheeseburger Springroll I didn't want to order anything else ( even though I had already asked for a Singapore Slaw) I was officially turned off.I had just had enough of the whole experience. I was turned off that the great Susur Lee seems to be pandering to the masses. THIS WAS NO MORIMOTO'S! Maybe it was an extremely busy night but the place just seemed chaotic. Like the computers were down BUT THEY WEREN'T!I'm glad we didn't get a table - I'm glad I didn't spend lavishly on a whole meal there cause the dessert from my hotels room service was amazing that night compared to everything at LEE RESTAURANT!\nquestion: How cute is the decor?",

They're supposed to call you if you're next in line but we just showed up.2. It was PACKED, looud, crammed, full of happy laughing people. 3.

We had a bunch of the tacos, and all were perfect. A big standout for me was their shrimp taco. The shrimp inside was breaded and fried, which made me nervous that it would only taste like batter and oil. I was so wrong. It had a wonderful shrimp flavor that was perfectly complemented by the sauce. The beef cheek was also a highlight.

Extensive menu with a huge pizza selection and daily specials. Average to higher prices but excellent service. Ordered the special ravioli di malale (with braised pork) and pesto. It wasn't amazing, the pesto tasted a bit bland and could have used a bit more garlic. The ravioli was pretty standard and slightly chewy. But the Tonnarelli alla Norine was delicious! Generously covered in black truffles, it was filling and flavorful with each bite. The pastas are generally more chewy which was perfect to my friend's liking. Tiramisu was not special, probably wouldn't order again but the hazelnut gelato was amazing. So rich and creamy, immediately regretted ordering my go to Tiramisu.

There is a lounge area that has beautiful couches and throw pillows where you can enjoy drinks with friends in a great ambiance. All in all, a great dining experience with great service.

When I first entered Byblos I was endeared by their lovely decor and ambience, you could tell that great thought was put into the design, flow and layout of this place. The place fills up real quick during the nights and the night I came had many tables reserved. The food portions are adequate and fills you up without leaving too heavy of an after taste. The flavor pairings of the dishes were very well though out beginning with waitress' recommendation of fig salad; the herbs and leafs in this was so fresh I almost felt like I was eating it straight from the plant. The sauces and seasoning was so eloquently used that everything balanced out so well, not ashamed to say that I quickly chowed down the entire plate in mere seconds. Next I had the crispy squid, similar to calamari but a little lighter and smaller tentacles. Also had the steak tartare paired with greek yogurt (they call it labneh) which melted in your mouth, albeit being a little plain. The lamb rib felt a little stingy; each bone was probably one bite-size, nothing special.Probably the best dish tonight was the oxtail basmati rice, a little on the heavy size, it was aromatic, creamy and rich. The flavour of the oxtail was imbued into each scoop of the yellow golden rice, while the kale offered a variation in texture with every mouthful. This I am definitely coming back for.To finish had the chocolate mousse and burnt honey ice cream. Mousse was typical, but the ice cream was interesting - I actually don't know how they got that flavour so on point! Must try (and it's only $3).An amazing discovery I had tonight was dukkah: crushed hazelnuts, coriander seeds, sesame seeds, cumin. The texture and aroma of this garnish is addictive, and Byblos isn't afraid to abuse their dukkah. I left craving for more, and now I'm in the search for making some at home.\nquestion: How ambient is the light in this place?",

Had to guess it'll just be dividing the cost of 3 tacos and add 2 in there.  When the Fish Tacos came, it came with an added bonus of a piece of hair, you can tell that it's not Hair on your head.  we don't want to get into details about it, but after waiting yet another 10 minutes to spot Laura, we told her what happened and she did apologize (at least she did this right).

I ask for water a second time, didn't happen.Spotting her refilling water with a jug nearby, we ordered food a second time after all the dishes came out, she took our orders and left an empty water jug on the table all the way till the end of the meal even though she had came to our table a few times. We ordered the Huarache Albanil (chorizo), but a dish came that don't look at all like Chorizo, and the server that brought it to us called it some other name that I didn't catch and then I ask her if it is chorizo and she said oh sorry, my bad, I meant to say Chorizo.  We weren't buying it, so we waited yet another 5 minutes to ask Laura, and she confirmed that it is the wrong dish and look it away.I asked for water one final time with a tone of dissatisfaction, she came with water and an apology.  She admitted it was terrible service throughout the meal and want to make up for it with 2 treats for my mom and brother since it's their birthday.  It was 2 mini sponge cakes with whipped cream and some crumbled corn flakes on top.  It was an extra wet sponge.  Very sad.I asked for the bill and checked the bill, I saw the two tiny 2inch treats on the bill at 7 bucks each!  I called her again and ask her what is this (pointing to the treats on the bill), she said oops! that was embarrassing!  Had I not check it, what would happen?Finally, credit card machine.  She hand it over to be but STOOD right beside me when I enter tips and everything as if she is afraid of not getting any tips.  This is how terrible the experience was in terms of service.Managers and bosses of this establishment should really fire these people if they want to improve and charge people the prices they are asking for.Food was awesome, we ordered the following:1. Guacamole en la Mesa - which isn't all that special.  Generous portion compare to all the other dishes.2. Atun - Tuna Ceviche, it was ok.3. Costilla Corta - a 24hr slow braised short rib on a menu that says for sharing and came out a bit larger than a golf ball.  Sure, flavours are there, but very dinky.4. Pulpo Canitas - Confit of Octopus, This one is very good, very interesting flavours and sauces, worth it.5. Huarache Albanil - Chorizo on a torilla.  What I love best about it is their black bean sauce, those are really nice.6.  Baja Taco - GOTTA TRY IT, one of the best Fish Tacos I've eaten.  Although I had better at local Mexican Pubs, but this one is very good.7.  Gobernador Taco- Great taste!  This lobster and shrimp taco is a must try! These two stars are for the great chefs behind the scenes.  Without them, it would be an awful double birthday dinner experience.\nquestion: Was the service horrible?",

It was cool and casual and the music was great. We went during an off time (lunch around 2pm), but there were still a lot of people there. I'd make reservations ahead of time if you're coming for dinner or any other busy time. The wait staff was fantastic, as well.[THE FOOD]The lunch menu is really simple, in a good way. You should be coming here for the chicken, anyway. If we were hungrier, we'd have opted for the $38 'Lucky Dice' special for two, which has the jackpot chicken, wings, hamburg, and soup/salad.We each got:1) THE JACKPOT CHICKEN (with crispy skin) - $15 for the lunch special, which includes jackpot chicken, rice, ginger-scallion sauce, and winter melon soup. Loved it! Reminded me of my childhood (with the soft chicken skin as well). The ginger scallion sauce was pungent and tasty. The crispy skin is a must get, and almost chip like. Also the rice was killer (had a hint of chicken fat in it. Yea.)2) ROAST CHICKEN RICE (with crispy skin) - Tastes like a mix between chicken and char siu. I liked the pickled green papaya that came with it. I'd go classic with the jackpot chicken, though. Next time I'd add a soy sauce egg, too! I know it's sometimes hard to justify getting Hainanese chicken for $15, but you get a hip restaurant and nice service with it. Would definitely come back.\nquestion: How is the chicken?",

I came here in a group of 7 in the winter and first thing that I didn't like was that the chairs had no backs and there was no coat check or coat rack in sight. Being that it was winter we all had to either wear our jackets or hold them on our laps. I folded mine up and sat on it and I may or may not have almost fell off cuz it was bulky...anyways, on to the food!I ordered the momofuku ramen and a pork bun to try. The pork bun was delicious but at $10 for 2 I could go and buy a pound of pork (siu yuk) and buns and make 20 at home. The ramen itself was really disappointing. The noodles were alright, the pork belly was alright, the egg was good but the broth was just meh. Granted I don't have a lot of knowledge or experience wit ramen but I've had ramen at other places where I want to drink every last sip of the broth and wish I could fit another bowl of ramen in my stomach.

            "input": "review: This is easily a 4.5 star restaurant!From the start to finish, I have to say that I was super impressed with the service! I made my reservation directly on the website through OpenTable. It was quick and easy. There was a comment box where I put that I wanted to get a dessert with a candle on it for my bf, which was super convenient because I didn't have to tell the waiter on the day of and ruin the surprise.On the day of, I got a confirmation call from Jacobs & Co. The person was super nice over the phone and asked if I wanted to order the dessert in advance so they could get it all ready and we didn't have to look at the dessert menu. This was super efficient and helped reinforce the surprise element (my bf had no idea!) When we got there, we were greeted at the door by a very sweet hostess. The hostess inside walked us upstairs to our table. I was surprised at the beautiful lounge area. There was a pianist and piano bar area and it looked like such a classy place to chill after work or on a Friday evening. I would go back to do this!Our waiter was super knowledgable and friendly. Since we don't know much about steaks, he took the time to explain where each cow came from, what they were feed and how this affects the taste of the steak, and even assessed what we liked, and offered recommendations! We ordered:Bread (free) - warm and buttery goodness!The infamous caesar salad - I was super impressed with the amount of ingredients that was in the salad and that it took the server about 15 minutes to make it in front of us. My only tip for improvement is to indicate on the menu that the salad is spicy because tabasco sauce is added. If I knew this, I would have asked for that to be omitted since I am a weaksauce for spice. We didn't see all the ingredients on her table either. This was a pretty great salad if people like a little kick in their caesar. You can taste each ingredient and the bacon is made with real chunks of pork. 4/5Duck fat fries - you can taste the duck flavour, which was pretty good. 4/5We decided to get two steaks to share so we could try a little bit of each. I loved that they cut it for you so that you don't have to do the work. It's ready to share the moment you get the steaks! We got the Canadian Prime Hereford-Guelph, ON Ribeye 14oz that was aged for 65 days and the A5 Black Tajima-Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, California Cut Striploin 4oz.The japanese Striploin was to die for! It was melt in your mouth delicious. It was honestly like an orgasm in my mouth. I absolutely loved it! It had a sweet taste to it and it was very rich in flavour! A must try! Pricey, but definitely worth the experience. 5/5The ribeye was really tender and juicy. It was pretty fatty to me and to be honest, I was too spoiled by the Striploin to truly think anything else could be better. However, the ribeye was very nicely flavoured and definitely a steak better than ruth chris or the keg, in my opinion. 4/5They also gave us a bunch of sauces, honey goat cheese, and other condiments, but we really didn't need them at all. In fact, we thought the sauces and such ruined the taste of the steak so we didn't use them.2oz Foie Gras - This was pretty delicious and flavourful. I haven't had foie gras in years so I can't really compare, but this was very juicy and tender. 4/5Chocolate Walnut Brownie - this was amazing!!! Rich chocolatey flavour brownie with lots of walnuts. The ice cream was toasted marshmallow, which is pretty unique. There was a long piece of marshmallow, which added to the favour of this dessert. ME LIKIE! 5/5Two chocolate sweets (free) -  a nice touch. if you just wanted a bit of sweetness and don't want to spend on dessert (or you rather get something else for this price) then this is good enough!All of this was followed by the infamous chocolate chip muffins that we got to take home for the next day. They were delicious when we both had it for breakie! Soft and moist!We left super full and then some. The bill came up to around $300 with tax and tip. We didn't get alcohol. Definitely a fine dining restaurant that served its purpose of a special night out to celebrate a special occasion. My bf loved it!This may be TMI, but the following day, my stomach was in knots. I suspect it was the amount of richness and butter that was used to prepare the food. I don't normally eat a lot of butter so it makes sense why I was having gastro issues the next day. My bf was completely fine and woke up still full from the night before!  A fine restaurant that gets you that full - BONUS! ;)Finally, we had leftover ribeye and duck fries that we ate 3 days later. We fried the steak a bit to heat it up and it was STILL as delicious as the day we tried it. The fries were a little soggy, but edible.Overall, I would definitely recommend Jacob and Co for a special occasion or for the steak lovers out there. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Toronto!\nquestion: Why is bread so delicious?",

            "input": "review: I have mixed feelings about this type of massive 500+ capacity restaurant. On one hand, I think the recent proliferation of mega bars (Real Sports, etc.) within walking distance of the Rogers Centre, the ACC, the financial district and the waterfront is a positive for the city, both in terms of tourism and serving the exploding condo neighbourhoods. On the other hand, these massive restaurants often fail in their execution.The BrewHouse certainly gets some things right. The outdoor seating is great, even if most of the tables don't really have any water views to speak of. It's a great summer vibe out there nonetheless. Also, the service was better than I would expect for such a big place.As you might expect, the beer is the real star here. In addition to the mass produced Amsterdam beers that have been available for some time, there are many craft and seasonal beers. It was my first visit, and it was for dinner before a Jays game, so I didn't order anything too adventurous. The Boneshaker is quite good if you're looking for something hoppy. For something lighter and fruitier, the Market Pale Ale is nice.  In terms of food, I had the smoke house burger, which was decent, but the kettle chips that came with it were soggy and almost inedible. We later saw that they had a huge line of kettle chips ready to go out with each order. This type of production-line food preparation, while possibly necessary to serve 500-800ish people, really diminishes quality. In terms of cost, the food isn't outrageously expensive given the location, but don't expect anything amazing.Many have complained about epic lines and wait times, but I'd imagine this will be less of an issue over time. We went on a Friday just before 5PM and got a table for four outside without any wait. We left around 7PM and there were still plenty of inside tables left. I would imagine in the winter months that they plan on attracting more of the local condo residents and those going to events at the ACC to fill the inside, since it's a big space to fill. All in all, this is a welcome addition to the waterfront and a great place to pre-game before a Jays game if you get there early enough.\nquestion: Is it a good menu?",

It's pricier and portions aren't huge, but this is balanced by high quality food and taste. Food:Not sure what more my review might add to what's already been said, but the food here is among the best Thai I've had in Toronto.I started off with the chicken skewers (Gai satay) and they were amazing. The skewers were very tender, juicy and flavourful.I tried their Pad Gra Prow in both pork and crispy pork. Personally I really preferred the crispy pork. It was crunchy, juicy and tender. The egg came put perfectly and the rice was delicious. I tried both the Goeng Klaw Wan (curry in a coconut and the Goeng Masaman (red curry). What stood out most to me was how rich each curry was. It was full bodied and creamy. I found myself tremendously impressed with the food. Medium spicy was fine by the way. Service:This is a bit of a difficult topic. They are very busy and popular. They try their best to accommodate but because of the traffic, I found that while the faces were friendly, it was hard to find my server. Getting drinks or refills was difficult because it's very noisy, and the waiters/waitresses are constantly on the go. Ambience:I love the decor. It's very spacious inside. There is loud upbeat music playing. This is not the kind of restaurant you want to go to for a quiet conversation. You will find yourself using your outdoor voice to communicate.

Thinking back however, I can't differentiate it between the pad thai I've eaten at Nana, or Sukho Thai, or even dare I say...Salad King! While I had been going through a Thai phase at the time, I truly believe that if a Thai place is amazing, it will come through in the pinnacle of Thai cuisines (to us Westerners anyway). So if the pad thai doesn't impress me, I may not be back.A tip: if you are looking for pad thai that is worth your while, go to Khao San Road. It's the only pad thai that has stood out to me in Toronto. I remember thinking that this would be the kind of thing you would find on the streets of Thailand!The atmosphere was okay, though other reviewers seem to like.

Although I should've been a little suspicious when nobody ever said Let's go to El Furniture Warehouse because they have great service! I am just going to start with the postitives. First has got to be the pricing of everything under $5. I mean you can't really go wrong with that since this area is surrounded by students from Highschool and University. The pricing is great for people who don't have tons of money to spend on some places located in the Annex. So that is definitely a great reason to come to this place. In terms of the quality of food.. I mean you get what you pay for. I thought that everything was decently good tasting. I got the Braised Beef Spaghetti, Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and a Mac and Cheese with bacon bits. Overall my favorite dish was the salad, second, Spaghetti and lastly the Mac and cheese. Everything was cooked well.. Nothing burnt or under cooked. Now with my experience. This is what I was so disappointed in the most when I got there. Let me just explain what I experienced  yesterday (Oct 23.14): Around 1PM my boyfriend and I decided to eat at El Furniture Warehouse since many people had recommended me to go. It is close to campus with cheap prices! Since I didn't have to work and it was pretty much a day off it was a great time to go. I thought going for a late lunch would be great. As we walked up to the place I noticed two people looking at the menu.. I guess they were deciding on take out. I notice immediately that it wasn't as busy as I've seen this place at night. Which was great - since we should be seated right away, right? WRONG! My boyfriend and I stood there trying to figure out, since it was our first time there, if it was a self seating place or if we had to wait for someone to have us seated. Finally after about a few minutes staring around awkwardly at each other and the people behind us, who were also waiting to be seated a waitress comes from the back and looks like she is going to get us seated. At first she was going to seat us at a high table that sits two people and across the bar but then she quickly asked us if we preferred to on the upper platform area at a table enough to sit four and we agreed to sit some where more spacious. Now this is something that I always do at every restaurant since I get thirsty quickly I told the waitress as she was about to leave to seat the other people behind us to get us two glasses of water to start. She said yes and continued her way down and sitting the other customers. As my boyfriend and I are deciding to pick what to eat we are looking around about 10 minutes later (maybe longer) still wondering where our water is. Finally I told him to bug another waitress who was wiping down a table near us to grab us water.. She said okay and in about 2 minutes our waitress brought us the water. I mean I would be a lot more understanding if it was extremely busy and if she had to wait for our food to be prepared and cooked but it's just water from a tap.. I couldn't believe we didn't just got our waters right away. I mean we had a girl on our left sitting near us who was seated AFTER we were and got her cocktail almost instantly well before we got our water. I just thought that was ridiculous. Finally when she brought the water we wasted no time to order our food so that we didn't have to wait so long for it to come out like our water. We used the time it took for the water to come out as an indicator as to how long the food would take and boy were we right! We ordered like I mentioned previously: beet salad, Mac and cheese and spaghetti. I think it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend and I were both on our phones and trying to kill the time until our food arrived. When it arrived I was very happy with my selection though. Everything looked great. Until my boyfriend noticed right away on his Mac and cheese that they had forgotten the bacon bits! (Which the waitress actually suggested) Honestly he was so fed up with waiting for everything to come out that he almost didn't want to return it. However I am not like that.. I thought if you're going to suggest something and get your customers wanting to add items to their food then you shouldn't forget it. So it took us almost a few awkward minutes trying to wave a waitress in this not so busy place down. When we told her that she forgot she went Oh yeah I am so sorry about that and quickly went to the back sprinkled some bacon and popped back without dish. This is something I just cannot understand.Why was it that it seemed so busy for the waitress when there wasn't that many customers in the place to begin with. Anyways after all of this waiting game my boyfriend and I ate all of our food quickly and just wanted to get out of there. We paid for our meals I think I came to $18? And we just put a $20 down and left. What a frustrating experience. :(-CL\nquestion: Is lunch cheap?",

The menu at first instance looked good, there are a fair few dishes and you have the option of requesting anything from a 1 chilli to a 20 chilli dish - I think a 20 chilli dish would require waxing of the tongue Home Simpson style so I went for a Beef Dish at level 5.The food came out super quick, as if the kitchen staff had a precognitive vision of what I would order before I had a chance to break anything, but I would have preferred in this case to wait for something that did not look rushed or not looked like the beef had been cooked in the morning and kept on a low heat till i arrived.So overall the experience was disappointing, the service was, once seated, quick and the waiter kept the water topped up and was polite and attentive.Do not see myself going here in a rush any time soon unless I have a group of 20 to seat.\nquestion: Was your seat comfortable?",

Portion sizes are absolutely perfect - generous but not so big you have to leave food on the plate. Their use of spices is impeccable, balanced and flavourful (and with varying degrees of heat for you to choose) - it truly does not get any better than this.- Their pad thai is excellent and properly made with the right ingredients (tamarind, pickled radish, etc - not ketchup or hot sauce).- Their curries are the best I've ever had in my life - the green curry with fish is light and refreshing; the panang beef curry is creamy and rich. Even the accompanying plain steamed rice is tasty. - Their salads are a lighter summer option, consisting of stir-fried ground meat with spices, served with steamed rice, that you can make into little burritos with the giant lettuce leaves.The Ambiance/Service: Very neat little basement-type restaurant, amazing relaxing decor, with wooden tables and fun colourful decorations. It transports you to another place - you could easily be on a tropical island rather than in the downtown core. The service has been consistently good, their servers being generally helpful with respect to the food. Pai is in a league of its own in terms of good Toronto restaurants. A must-try that I recommend to anyone in the city, either living here or passing through.

These were okay, nicely crispy coating and not greasy, but a few pieces were enough.The main arrived very shortly after delivery of the chicken, I understand that they need to keep things moving but a bit more time with the starter would have been good.For the main I had the Chef's special pad thai, I asked for the spicy version. This was very good with some depth of flavour and good balance between the savoury, sweet and sour elements, however the spice level was not really what I would consider spicy.

Music is great, portions are very generous and servers are very laid back yet attentive.  I do have some criticism following my most recent visit which I'll leave to the end.  Let's start off with the goodies first.Golden Hashbrown Poutine - Not your average poutine but definitely worth a try if you love any form of potato and like to try new things.  Their gravy is on point and if you also don't mind runny eggs, this is definitely a must try.  The two compliment each other quite well.  With the runny eggs, do keep in mind that if prefer your eggs cooked, they can't cater to this.  Alterations are actually not accepted here so be sure to read the menu to avoid disappointment.  Anywho, although this wasn't my order, I would personally go back for this. 5/5. Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast - If you can't decide between sweet or savoury, order this.  Not only will this dish satisfy both palettes, it'll keep your belly happy for most of your day.  What also goes perfectly with this would be their side of greens which, I find, helps cleanse your palette after every bite.  Think of it as the ginger slices with your sushi.  5/5.Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles - This was the first place in Toronto where I've had chicken & waffles.  Although I've had *the original* c&w at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, this is not too shabby.  Waffles are nice and fluffy, chicken is nice and crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside.  Roscoe's is still my fave but this is definitely next in line.  I have however, have yet to try other places. 4/5. I've had a few other things here but they are no longer on the menu.  But if you're curious, they were all still quite good.  Place is also great for small events including small weddings.  Had actually attended one a couple of years ago and the purpose of my last visit was to also scope out the place for another potential wedding.  It was my friend's (bride to be) first visit here and hopefully the experience during that last visit didn't take them off the list.Now I'd like to just go over the little criticism that I had first mentioned.  The only criticism I have about the place is the fact that they don't take reservations for brunch but then again, that's the norm at Liberty Village restaurants that offer brunch.  However, when you're waiting for your table during the colder days of Toronto, it's not exactly pleasant. They have this nice patio area at the front which would be very ideal for people to wait so perhaps management would look into investing in some of those heaters for their waiting customers? I understand that you can get a text when your table is ready but you need to also consider the fact that your customers are paying for parking and there aren't too many places to kill time around there that aren't restaurants.And speaking of waiting for your table, when we went here this past Sunday, the host told me that they generally give those next in line 5 to 10 minutes to get back before they release their table.  Well, over 20 minutes had passed when the party finally arrived.  Quite unfair to everyone else who have been waiting in the cold and/or cramped up waiting area.  Also with the waiting area which is really the space between the door and the host being cramped, there must be some fire code violation here. Anyway, maybe just something for management to consider.\nquestion: Is lunch food good in that place?",

Highlights of the evening included the welcoming and truly attentive service of the entire staff who delivered perfect dishes and wine throughout the evening, but the star was the FOOD.  From the moment you check out the specials board just inside the entrance to your first bite of bread dipped in oil with the added kiss of red wine vinegar and maple syrup you will know you are in the best of hands.  But its the glory of the meal that will send your tastebuds to paradise.  Tonight our two best dishes in years were the scallops special ---  incredibly fresh scallops served on a bed of kale and green beans BEAUTIFULLY prepared with a pepper puree, followed by the magical chocolate mousse dessert, it looks gorgeous and tastes even better!The scallop dish is an artfully creative beautiful dish served by sous chef Hayden Johnston. Scallops are drizzled with a delicate sauce that promises creamy citrus notes that bring out the scallop's nutty sweetness, and the pepper puree will combine with different vegetables on the plate to create unique flavor profiles that literally blow your mind. Seriously and without exception, one of the best dishes either of us have ever eaten in the past several years of traveling. Richmond Station's Chocolate Mousse Dessert was a palate pleasing homage to a genius combination, Scotland's rare single malt scotch and rich dark chocolate.  Each bite builds a dessert that is the perfect end to a truly unforgettable meal. Thank you to the entire Richmond Station team, your chef's table is an incredible experience.  You should be so very proud, you rocked it!Oh...and did I add that without the wine (which was AMAZING) our meal with tax cost less than $100???

I've also tried the original Santouka in Vancouver and the Toronto location is consistent in quality and taste.  I've been back to Santouka multiple times.I suggest coming late or early on a weekday if you don't want to line up, although lately in the summer the lines have shrunk a little.  I'm going to attribute that to Ryerson students being off and a surge of other Ramen restaurants opening (Raijin is just up the street but not nearly half as good). My go-to is the spicy ramen, but the shio and shoyu have their own merits.  It's not too spicy and they give you a large class of water to cool you off if it is.  The noodles all come with pork slices and other assorted toppings  You can choose to upsize your noodles or toppings as well.  Tip: You can request for reduced lard and salt if you're looking to be more healthy (let's face it, this has about as much nutrition as mcdonalds).  Two great side orders are additional tender pork slices (they will literally melt in your mouth and are great for dipping into the soup) and the gyoza which is not cooked from frozen like some other restaurants.  Service is quick and friendly.  I'm positive all the wait staff and cooks are Japanese, which adds to the ambiance.  Servers take your orders on their phones and due to the busy-ness, will be quick to both serve you and clean your table when you're done eating.  Don't expect anything more than a 30-45 minute meal.This place gets 5 stars because it is simply the best tasting ramen in Toronto.\nquestion: How good is the service?",

I'm a killer for gelatos and also really specific with the consistency and by far they nailed it! The servers are very polite, considerate, and patient. Walking in just gives me a feeling of joy and ofcourse the dessert is included in my joy and happiness. Some of the cakes there are half decent, wasn't a huge fan of the tiramisu and creme brûlée.

I should note though, that I am a vegetarian so I can only speak through that lens (however my partner ordered their chicken wings and was underwhelmed by the flavours). In general, there were limited options on the menu (small menu overall); there was one vegetarian option. The menu identified which dishes could be made vegan (only about 2-3), which was good and identified which dishes had oyster sauce (which was helpful so that I could avoid those!). I ordered 2 dishes that could be made vegan (green curry and khao soi). I felt the dishes we ordered lacked flavour and depth and the curries relied quite heavily on coconut milk/cream, which made the curries pretty thick in consistency. The vegetables in the dishes were cut into huge chunks and tasted pretty bland. I have had vegetarian thai food at other thai restaurants and the flavours can be pretty amazing even without the fish sauce. Taste is very important to me and I feel that this restaurant let me down and I did not enjoy my meal.

Aside from the expansive and cosy patio they have here, the interior of the restaurant is simply gorgeous - Giant tequila/liquor wall at the bar area, colorful decor, edgy wall art, rustic wood tables, to the Mexican wrestling mask in black lighting - all give a very fun and energetic vibe. It is very clear you will have a fun time here.Of course, good decor means little if the food is not up to snuff. Me and my dining companions had a tasting of various dishes. We were started off with some guacamole and chips, with the avocado smashed at table side. It came with a variety of sauces from mild to hot, and also some crickets in a mild chili oil. The guac was very fresh and tasty, and it was neat to try the crickets which are very rich in protein.The Atun Ahi tuna ceviche - with watermelon, Yucateco mignonette, lime and chives, was light and refreshing. It went well with some chips as well and got the appeitite going.The Esquites were surprisingly good - made with charred corn off the cob, epazote, chiptole aioli and lime. Even though it's in a shot glass, it is a warm dish, and the flavour of the freshly grilled corn with the aioli was amazing! I would say this is a must-get.Sopes de Tinga - pulled chicken chipotle with tomato stew, black bean puree, lettuce, crema fresca, queso cotija on corn flour masa. This was delicious as well and well worth trying.Pescado Nayarit - Grilled beeline snapper that is marinated in chile ancho, served whole and de-boned. Came with corn tortila, avocado and salsa martajada. A great dish if you feel like having some fish tacos.Pollo Almendrado - Chicken supreme in almond sauce, fried plantains, chayote squash, sauteed zucchini. This was my favorite dish of the night. The chicken was prepared perfectly and was moist and tender. It had a nice crispiy skin, and the almond sauce was really delicious with it. Everybody at the table loved it and I would put this on the must-get list as well.For dessert, we had some churros - they were pretty large, and yet very light and airy which are perfect. Easily the best churros I have ever had. We also had the Xocolatl (Mexican mousse, candied confir papaya and almond brittle). Surprisingly the Xocolatl was our least favorite item of the evening, as we were expecting something sweet at the end but it was not that sweet at all.Throughout the night we also had various drinks and they were all quite delicous. We split a pitcher of their margheritas and all drinks were made strong and definitely worth getting.Even though some reviewers have noted that this place is pricey, I really don't think it is considering the location and the environment. I thought items such as the tacos and the chicken mole were pretty on par with most restaurants that are not located in touristy areas.Overall, we enjoyed our night at El Catrin immensely. The food, the welcoming service and the vibe here definitely took my mind off a stressful day, and I would not hesitate to recommend El Catrin to anyone.\nquestion: How is the light?",

Khao San Road's chef doesn't hold back on Thai spices and garlic which allows their dishes to be bursting with Thai flavor. Salad King's dishes are much more toned down and compared to Khao San Road, it could seem a little bland in terms of flavor. Because of the spices, Khao San Road's dishes feels heavy whereas Salad King's dishes seem lighter (if that makes any sense). It's really a personal preferance as to if you prefer Khao San Road or Salad King.Summary: Khao San Road focuses on staying true to Thai flavors, so be aware and get ready to taste some garlic if you've only tried food court Thai food. Personally, I like both places- I def think Khao San Road makes better Pad Thai but if I wanted noodles in coconut curry, I would visit Salad King for Islamic Noodles.\nquestion: What food in California is good?",

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.\nquestion: Does this place has a good atmosphere?",

I tried most of their go-to dishes on the menu and I can confidently say if you don't mind the price tag, you should try as many dishes as possible because it's worth it! I was not a big fan of their famous Khao Soi or pad tai ( I mean they are still good but not mind blowing like what others said ) but I quite enjoyed everything else. Their green curry is not mind blowing as well but still have all the flavours that you look for when it comes to Thai curry My usual go to is pad gra prow with crispy pork. It's a fried rice dish with your choice of meat that's cooked with Thai basil serve with sunny side egg, cucumber and fish sauce. This dish has everything. There is tenderness of meat and crispness and juicy fat from crispy pork. Fish sauce brings all the flavours out and creamy runny egg York wraps all the flavours together. When you feel like it's little too much of fat, there is silky rice and crispy cucumber to balances out the dish. Perfect dish I'll like to have when I have a little cheat day.Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup is another favorite of mine. Braised beef is so tender it just falls apart in your mouth. There is good balance between creaminess of peanut butter, spice, sweetness and sourness of lime. It was little bit on the heavier side than other Chiang Mai beef noodle soup I tried. Still darn good. If you are not into heavy dishes, just go for beef salad or papaya salad. They are very refreshing but yet has lots of flavour and quite filling. I took one star off because up and down of service. It's 50% chance hostess and servers will be very rude and forgetful and 50% chance they will provide the acceptional service. Also it's extremely busy during the dinner time so make a reservation or expect to be in the line for 30+ min. The place is cute and fun but to me the wait time and effy service ain't worth dine in.

It was by no means bad, but I didn't find anything remarkable about my food. After returning for a second time and trying a few other things, I kind of get it. I came with two friends on Friday and this time was seated in the room on the lower floor. This room is definitely more intimate and quieter than the main dining room, although less interesting to look at. To start, we ordered the fried calamari, which was actually really, really good. It was just lightly breaded, so it wasn't like the dough overwhelmed the taste of the squid. And I'm so glad it didn't, because the squid was fantastic! It tasted really fresh, and then the texture of it was just perfect - chewy and tender, but still quite soft and moist. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice on it, and it is just amazing. For my main, I tried the seafood spaghetti which everyone raves about. I kind of wish it came with a different kind of pasta, because spaghetti just seems so basic. That being said, it was a good pasta - the texture of the pasta was great, and once again, the seafood, which included clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, and calamari was very fresh, sizeable (the shrimp were huge), and plentiful. I honestly can't get over the texture of their calamari in general, it's just so good. I will say that I thought the portion was a little bit on the smaller side for dinner though. I also sampled a bit of my friends' dishes. One got the pappardelle del iosa which comes with spicy sausage. One bite wasn't too spicy, but I think it would build up. I thought this was okay. My other friend ordered off the special menu for the day, and got pappardelle made with spinach (so the noodles were green) and which came with duck confit. I liked this one better, because I found the duck to be more flavourful than the sausage, although a bit on the salty side. Also the noodles were a bit firmer in this dish.For dessert, we split some kind of sponge cake thing which had limoncello and mascarpone. I quite enjoyed this, because it was very light and fluffy, not too sweet, and had quite a delicious zesty flavour. It was actually the perfect dessert for me and I would recommend.The takeaway from this is that Terroni knows how to do seafood right. Get the calamari and the seafood pasta, and you'll be impressed. I'm still a little iffy on some of their other dishes, but at least now I have a few solid tried-and-true favourites at this restaurant.\nquestion: Is it a good space?",

This is a serious recorder.  It may lack a lot of the key features of the H4n, but it more than makes up for it on simplicity, weight and sound quality.Essentially although Zoom stripped out  a lot of features (and weight), they left the most important features intact... two perfectly matched microphones and outstanding recording quality.The most popular use for the H1 is to record separate audio for DSLR videos.  Because it's so small and light, you can easily get a mount to attach it right on top of your camera.Two things you should know about.1. There is no wind screen, so either use it inside or get one.  The microphones are super sensitive, and can pick up the smallest sounds... so wind will be a problem if you don't get a good windscreen.2. The case itself is sensitive...

I wanted something like this and pretty much knew I needed to have video.When compared to the other choices I wanted to make sure I did not have to convert my library over (its 50% WMA and 50% MP3) and that it did decent video. I also wanted FM. The obvious choice was the Creative Zen Vision. Alas I am not the type to buy something expensive without first checking it out. I was never able to see one. No Brick and Mortar store carried one for me to look at. So I delayed for months before bying anything. Then I got an opportunity to play with the Zune. Here is what I liked.Its a good form factor for me. I know people love their skinny iPods but for me that would encourage putting in places it will get bent and none of these devices do well with that! Also, I like the size of it because my hands are big and I have something to hold on to.I like the big wide screen but don't be fooled, its still a 4:3 ratio and not 16:9. The best films to rip are fullscreen not wide screen. I've used the AVS DVDtoGO software for that. The picture quality is great. Very colorful and sharp. The size of the screen means my eyes can see it well.The software is good. It takes a bit of getting used to. I was expecting to drag and drop files onto a file system but that isn't how the Zune works. You create a library and it synchronizes. You get a lot of options on how you want to view this library and you get a lot of options on how you create playlists. It took a while to figure out how to keep some files off the Zune (like screenshots for work that I had in My Pictures) but once you figure it out it makes sense.The sound quality is excellent and the reception on the FM radio is also excellent! It uses RDS to get song information and station identification. The interface is very clean and easy to use.Things that are missing that you should know about: The Zune cannot act as a USB hard drive. This is probably a big surprise to many. Also, the Zune cannot record either voice via microphone or its Digital FM signal.I like the Zune quite a bit. Its easy to use and shows quality workmanship. There are some missing features and the software has a short learning curve but for me the combination of its advantages are a real bonus.\nquestion: Is the software installed easy to use for novices?",

This remote is being used to control : Hitachi 32HDL51 TV, DishNetwork DVR-625, Sony STR-DA7ES receiver, JVC HR-S9911U VHS, HP Z540 computer, Archos AV-500 PVR and an X10 light controller.  So far the only problem I've had is with the X10 controller, but I haven't put any time into debugging it.The computer I am using for programming the remote is a Dell E521 ( AMD 64X2 5600+ processor ) running Windows XP Pro SP2. Installing and running the software was quite straightforward ( I'm on a 3Mbps DSL connection ).  I find the software to be fairly intuitive, but did note the \"strange\" English that other reviewers have mentioned.The only glitch I ran into when doing the initial setup for the remote was that the software wanted to \"read\" some of the signals for the DVR-625 and the Sony receiver though I had checked before buying the remote to make sure they were supported.  It then occurred to me that both of these units have TWO remote controls ( both have two-room capability ).  The software was just checking to see which remote I was using.  BUT that showed me that the folks who have complained about the remote's learning capability have legitimate concerns.  I have had a number of teachable remotes, and this is the first one I've had a problem with.  The main problem seemed to be lighting - I had to turn off a lamp about 3 feet away before I had any success at all.  Then, if I had the remotes about 3\" apart, and pressed the button for no more than 1 second, the signals were received ok.  This is the main reason for a 4 star rating rather than 5 star.I spent most of today setting up the \"favorite channels\" on the remote.  The only reason it took so long was that I searched the web for appropriate icons to use, then had to edit them to get 75x44 pixel images ( don't try to use any other size - the icons \"stretch\" to fit 75x44 ).  A really good source for \"nice\" icons is [...]After getting the icons, setting up the favorite channels feature was a breeze.  And, best of all, it actually works.As far as the physical design of the remote, I find it very easy to use.  A lot of thought went into the placement of the buttons, and I have no trouble using it with \"one hand operation\".  The remote I replaced with this one was also a touch-screen ( rather old Sony one ), so I have no problem with the touch-screen.  I also have fairly small fingers, so that may help!  It is a fairly small screen.  I find the lighted buttons to be extremely useful, and it's pretty neat that they turn on as soon as you pick up the remote.  I can't comment too much on the battery life, since I've only had it for 3 days.  But the battery indicator hasn't moved very far from full during that time.In conclusion, I'm quite satisfied with this remote.  Before buying one, make sure it will control your components with a minimum of \"teaching\", because that's a real bummer.  You can check all your components on Logitech's home page.Added after initial review:  Just noticed the remote wasn't really turning the DishNetwork DVR on or off.  The \"help\" and \"device\" could turn it on/off, but not the \"activity\".  I wasn't able to correct the problem with any of the adjustments, but the setup allows one to add steps to activities.  I added a \"select\" to turn it on and \"power toggle\" to turn it off.  Now it works fine.\nquestion: Is the software included good?",

I might have appreciated a rubberized feel to the sides of this mouse rather than the textured hard plastic, but it's just as effective.This mouse lost a star due to a couple annoyances I have.First off, this does not use the Logitech universal receiver that the company uses for other wireless keyboards/mice. It's receiver polls at a much higher frequency. This paired with the fact that the mouse runs off of one AA NiMH battery, means the battery life is pretty abysmal; few hours at most. They've cleverly designed the charging cable to turn the mouse into a cabled variant which is convenient, but I now find myself almost exclusively using the mouse in this way rather than via wireless which defeats the purpose.Secondly, I lift my mouse off the mat while using it quite often. It's a habit I've had for 15 years or so. When I do that with this mouse, I almost always push one or two of the bottom thumb buttons. It's been enough of a problem that I've had to manually set these buttons to do nothing in games and the Logitech software (it would affect the DPI of the mouse). This probably won't affect twitch gamers or anyone else that doesn't have this habit though.\nquestion: Are you satisfied with the battery life of the kindle?",

A pair I bought at Radio Shack 5 years ago for $27 (bedroom), which died and is the reason for my purchase.  I also have the Sony headphones for $150 (TV room).  These cost $75 (bedroom).  My $27 headphones were the best in every way; sound, no problems, always worked.  Radio Shack no longer has the headphones.  When I first got the Senn headphones they worked 50% of the time and it was very frustrating.  We found out that when we had them plugged into the back of the TV (brand new LCD TV), that was the reason for them working only 50% of the time but when we plugged them into the back of our DVR, they work 100% of the time and we have had no more problems.  The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that they are not comfortable and fall of my head easily.  I didn't know they weren't the type that covers the whole ear.  The type that covers the whole ear are the most comfortable and the sound is better because your ear is encased.  Also they don't fall off.  When I'm sitting in bed watching TV with my head against a couple of pillows, it moves these headphones forward slightly off my ears and the sound is not as loud.

I did try it out with my son's PS3...- It did connect.- It did work within the games for communication to the other remote players in the game- It WILL NOT also work to route 100% of the GAME SOUNDS and GAME AUDIO to the device.  Note:  This is NOT a limitation of the device, its the audio implementation on the PS3 consoles.  To route GAME AUDIO and In-Game Communication to a wireless headset, you need $250-500 bucks for the high end and uber-expensive Turtle Beach rig.2.  After lots of trial and error and comparing notes with those in the office that have one also...- The device that you are connecting it to, and its Bluetooth audio capabilities have A LOT to do with the call quality of it.- Via a computer with NATIVE Bluetooth or an aftermarket Bluetooth USB adapter... its still not going to sound as good as a Plantronics Blutooth device that has a custom audio functionality built in.  My Plantronics BT300M sounds like you are right there as far as your vocals to the person on the other end of the call.  It sounds like you.  It doesn't sound like a highly compressed tin can.  The LG HBS700 on the other hand... you are in a compressed, metallic sounding mode.- The device via a cell phone depends on the cell phone.  I recently switched from an LG handset to a Samsung Galaxy SIII and that made a HUGE difference.  The LG sounded tinny.  The Samsung sounds wonderful and realistic.Bottom line, this thing WEARS like a dream.  Battery life is incredible.  Music plays wonderfully.  Call quality will depend on whatever device you are connecting it to, and even at that, its just trial and error.If LG or Plantronics want a market winner here... THEY NEED TO COLLABORATE!!!

Probably would be a good primary router as well, but I use it as a range extender. I now get 3 bars downstairs where I used to get zero signal, and 4 bars out on the deck.I wish I could say the set up was easy, but because my wifi router is 7 years old and was set to WEP security it wasn't the simplest to get it to work. I had to call tech support. Thankfully the woman was incredibly helpful. She walked me through switching my router's security type to WPA and then the set up for the Almond Securifi was a breeze. So if you've got a newer main router to begin with, or at least one not using outdated security types, you'll probably just plug it in, click on the signal from your current router in the list, enter your router password, then wait 30 seconds for the Almond to do the rest. You'll then see a graphic showing the connection and can just direct your devices to the new signal instead of the old one. She was also going to show me how to merge the listings for the two signals, so that only one would show instead of ABC and ABC_almond, but I actually prefer seeing the two separate.I love that you can visually see the connection, and that each morning when I plug both devices in again, since I unplug both devices overnight (don't want to expose myself to more electromagnetics than necessary), within just seconds it finds all its settings and there are those green visuals showing the connection again. No need to reconfigure anything.It's also quite small and sleek looking, so not an eyesore in the middle of the kitchen (the halfway point in my house).  I like it so much that when I decide to retire my old router I will definitely be getting a second one of these. It's signal is also not quite strong enough to cover my entire property with just one (has range of 100 ft), but with two of them I'll be in great shape.Special bonus, if you are a T-mobile cell user, you already know you can use your wifi connection to make calls and send texts/surf the web. So extending your wifi range to all of your property, not just where your computer is, will be even more worthwhile.  Just be sure to unplug all this wireless stuff when everyone goes to bed at night if you're going to amp up the coverage so that it's hitting the bedrooms too. You'll sleep better.

I really like the fact that it doubles as a case (hence the clamshell) when closed up. The Blutooth keyboard pairs in a snap and works great. Love the added function keys (home button, etc.) and found the size more than comfortable to type on. I've had this on my ipad for a while. I thought this would be one of those things I'd use solely for travel but the truth is this case/keyboard has stayed on my iPad since I bought it. The matte finish is nice and I love that it's not emblazoned with stupid logos.  Doesn't add a lot of weight and I really like the adjustability of the screen angle. Battery life is pretty terrific, too. One other nice thing - I like being able to 'detach' the iPad and set that up as a separate piece from the keyboard. There are some other nice touches - the rubber feet, the fact that you can change from portrait to landscape. Once you remove the iPad from the arm, the hard plastic case stays with it so conceivably you could just travel with that. It's not perfect - I realized carrying it in my bag that it is just a little heavier than I would like. And it would be nice if the hinge had a ratchet action.

I only have one Amazon movie, but use Hulu Plus and NetFlix. Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD. Since many, if not most of my books are Amazon, that is a bummer - I like text to speech for when I am driving and listening at bedtime. Audible's audiobooks works fine on both.Web Browsing. Believe it or not, I side-loaded Chrome on my KFHD some time ago, but I really just use Silk. Silk is fine for my needs.So both are fine devices, so what are the attractions to one over the other?- Nexus 7 has my favorite Google apps - like Google Maps.- Nexus 7 has GPS, which sounds useful, haven't played much with it yet.- Nexus 7 allows multiple user accounts. That will really be handy.- Nexus 7's back facing camera lets you take pictures even it you look funny doing it.- Google Play store has a bajillion apps, 99.9997% of which I don't care about. But there are a half dozen I would like that aren't on Amazon's store.- Kindle Fire's built-in ebook reader will display both Amazon and non-Amazon books and will do text to speech on them all.I own both, but if I had pick just one today, I'd pick the Nexus 7. BUT, I noticed today that only the 16 gig version of the KFHD is for sale at Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is about to release a new version? Next month could be a different story.There are minor details, like the Nexus needs a special adapter cable for HDMI out where the KFHD uses a separate, \"normal\" socket. And the Nexus buttons are tiny and I find myself fumbling to find them.If you have an older model and are thinking of upgrading, perhaps waiting to see what Amazon responds to the Nexus 2013 with would be good.

Sure, there are \"better\" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera.\nquestion: Is it a good lcd screen?",

Before I bought it, I read some other reviewers that suggested using the elastic band to bind back the cover when reading. As in, open the cover all the way until it touches the back cover and flip the band around it to hold it there. This works great. The cover is nice and stiff which seems to provide good protection. The light, for me, works really great. It is really convenient not having to have a separate light and/or batteries. Some reviewers have complained about the included LED light being unevenly distributed. This is true, but mine doesn't seem to be in any way that bad. I played with the light (it slides out on a molded flat plastic arm in the top right hand corner of the back), and see that if the light is angled just a little bit more down or up it changes the light distribution considerably. Which leads me to wonder if the lights that are giving the most problems are just off-angled. Anyway, it is just a thought. Oh, and I love the detail for the band, meaning the sliding leather tab which assists in locking the cover open/closed.\nquestion: Is the cover hard?",

            "input": "review: I love quality displays. I really do. While I don't get into the realm of the insanely expensive professional monitors, I really appreciate a good IPS/PLS monitor. And here's another one.Surprisingly, getting the monitor out of the box wasn't as easy as I'd have hoped. The stem of the monitor (the part that attaches to the stand) is sort of wedged (gently!) against a piece of foam, so it took a little bit of wiggling to get the screen out. If you have someone to help, this would go much more easily!Putting the monitor on the stand took just a few seconds. It hand-screws in, and has a very solid base. It's also an extremely ugly, huge base, and absolutely my one major gripe with the monitor.But let's focus on the good stuff first:For reference, this was tested on a 2011 MacBook Air via mini-Displayport to Displayport (2560x1440), and with a Google Chromecast via HDMI (1920x1080).1.) Pre-calibrated out of the box. Given that my screen came with a specific-to-this-serial-number piece of paper documenting the factory calibration, I was extremely impressed with the output.2.) The controls on the bottom right of the screen are touch sensitive. Normally I'm not a fan of such buttons, but these are without a doubt the most responsive touch-buttons I've used on a monitor. Really good stuff.3.) The screen isn't matte, and it isn't glossy. It's a really excellent combination of the two, cutting down on the glare of a glossy display, while maintaining those rich colors and good contrast.4.) Viewing angles, like many/most IPS panels, is truly excellent.5.) Able to rotate the screen 90 degrees, and it does line up perfectly straight when locked into that 90-degree position. Also, the height adjustment is superb, with plenty of height for me, and I'm 6'5\".6.) No dead/stuck pixels on the monitor I received. Good!7.) No PWM-dimming flicker (if you're sensitive to this, you'll be glad to know!), and no buzzing or other untoward noises from the display at any brightness.8.) While certainly not specifically a gaming monitor, it definitely holds its own. My gaming monitor of choice is myEIZO Foris FS2333-BK 23-Inch Screen LCD Monitor, but if you want something bigger without the viewing-angle deficiencies of TN panels, this would not be a bad choice for the less hardcore PC gamers among you. I wouldn't recommend it for 1080p gaming since the scaling to 1440p can be quite ugly.9.) You can turn off the blue power LED when the monitor is in use, from the Settings menu. I really don't like unnecessary LEDs, so this is something I immediately looked for and was glad to find.And now, the cons:1.) The base of the stand is horrible. I'm not sure what Viewsonic were thinking, but surely somebody could have come up with something a little less of an eyesore. I'll be mounting the screen on a VESA mount (100x100), but still - ouch! So ugly, and it takes up a huge amount of room on the desk for no apparent reason.2.) The brightness is set far, far too high out of the box (maxed out). All this did was draw attention to a little light bleed on the left of my particular display, only view-able on a completely black image. After the brightness was turned down to a less eye-searing level, this was (mostly) gone.Overall, though, this is a top-notch monitor, and highly recommended.5 stars out of 5.\nquestion: How is the base?",

            "input": "review: We have been using the Hero 2 for a couple of years and have loved it.  We use our Hero for taking video of skiing, rafting, body boarding, and getting underwater images.  So we were excited to give the Hero 3 a try.  The Hero 2 is a great camera, and the Hero 3 follows in that tradition, but the redesign has resulted in a few problem areas.  Below are the pros and cons after nearly four weeks of use:Pros-  It is perhaps 30% thinner than the Hero 2.  The slim form factor is immediately noticeable and welcome.  I always felt the 2 was too bulky.- Using the menu system is about the same.  That is, you use a pair of buttons to navigate through a series of two-level menus.  Your options show up on the small LCD screen on the front of the Hero.  The great thing about the Hero 3 Black Edition is that you can control the menus via a mobile iOS app over WiFi.  The app greatly enhances the the ease of use of the Hero 3.  If you don't  use the app (or the add-on LCD screen), be sure you practice navigating the menus and understanding the camera's features before you use it.  The menu and features are moderately intuitive but we need to refer to the user's manual for one-off features.- The WiFi on the Black version is great.  As mentioned before, the iOS app let's you change the camera's settings, but it also allows you to preview what the camera sees without having to buy the $70 LCD add-on.  Using the WiFi feature was very easy and makes this camera worth the price.  You can remotely start recording set the recording features (resolution, time lapse, etc.)  The Black edition also comes with a rechargeable wireless remote that replicates the small monochrome LCD screen on the Hero 3. You can navigate the two-level menu on your remote like you would on the Hero 3 itself.- The quality of the captured video is amazing.  You can select resolutions from VGA through 4k cinema quality.  We use ours at HD resolution and get great results.  The lens is wide angle, so you capture all of the action.- The camera is very versatile.  One of our favorite features is the looping feature that allows the camera to loop back over itself.- You can save your video in RAW camera format to do significant post-processing.  This is a great feature for pros.  It also has a \"Protune\" feature that records at 24 fpm (a TV standard).- You can take photos while it records video.  This feature works great, giving us clear wide-angle shots.- The LCD and extra battery pack that we used with our Hero 2 also work with the Hero 3CONS- The camera is fast and responsive, but a couple of times the camera has frozen while I'm paging through menus.  I have the latest firmware update, so maybe another one is needed by GoPro.  We have to shutdown the camera to unfreeze it.- The sound is decent, but not super-clear.  GoPro makes it clear that using the waterproof case will muffle the sound.  Well, that's the price you pay for a waterproof case.  With the standard case, the sound is better.  Without a case, the sound is very acceptable (but it still doesn't match the quality of the video).  We have not tried out the external mic, but it wold be a good idea to use it if great sound is important to you.- The battery life is only about two hours in our best case.  A second battery would a good idea.CONCLUSIONA great camera.  It is the first generation of an overhaul, so you might well-served waiting for the Hero 4, but the Hero 3 really is a good choice if you want to get your adventures on film.  We love using it for filming wildlife (using the MiFi iOS app), on rollercoasters, etc.  THe positives definitely outweigh the negatives.  Fun, versatile, professional camera.\nquestion: Do you think the audio is very strong?",

            "input": "review: I ordered a pair of these for my dad and I about 6 months ago. My dad loves his old music and didn't think headphones were a big deal until he got these from me for x-mas. I think I accidentally turned him into a bit of an audiophile lol. As for myself, I love these things.The quality is truly amazing. The bass is VERY clean even at very high levels and not overwhelming by any means. The mids and highs are very very nice as well. You can hear so many things extra going on in your music than before making it a completely new experience even with a mobile device. I even tried these out on my FiiO e10 amp/dac and they are even more amazing!I've listened to other earbuds and found these are the best suited for me at a decent price. I can wear these all day long for days on end and not even notice them being in. By far the most comfortable I have ever had. Another great point is the noise cancelling. There is this fat redneck piece of crap that rides in the back of the bus that never ever shuts up with the most annoying girlish cackle that puts you into an instant rage when wanting to sleep. These buds with a very low volume drowns him out very well surprisingly and I sleep great! Definitely a huge bonus when I am away from home for 17 hours a day.Beats headphones are a bloody joke! It annoys me to no end to see people buying that garbage just because it's signed by an uneducated rapper. :\\ I've had a lot of earbuds to know those things don't even compare to the cheapest plastic ear ripping garbage out there. My coworkers I ride the bus with (very long ride every day ugh) are so brainwashed thinking they can somehow justify that massive price they paid. I showed them mine and I could see them lie when they said the Beaters were better. I'll enjoy my music thank you and they can continue to have an orgy of stray cats fighting over living territory in their ears.In summary, I'm far from being an audiophile. Very far. From my experience, headphones were always just that: headphones. Now I've realized they can be so much more! From my experiences, these babies pretty much alleviate any complaints of other headphones I have had in the past. Of course the quality isn't quite at audiophile levels but for the price, they are beyond exceptional. These have got to be the best value out there tailored for my tastes.\nquestion: How do you get so high?",

            "input": "review: .We purchased this set after returning the disappointing Vizio M3D470KD  3D TV.We love this set. Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, \"soap opera effect.\" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and \"live\" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about.\nquestion: How is that effect so good?",

Because they come with several different sizes of soft rubber earpieces, they are more comfortable than the buds shipped with most players.The bad news is that these buds do nothing to reduce sound.  If you are planning on using them on the bus, for instance, you will find that background noise is no different from using the usual cheap phones.Construction on these is really flimsy.  The cord is the thickness of a piece of embroidery thread.  With daily use, I don't expect them to last much more than a month.For comparison, I have previously used theShure E2c Sound Isolating EarphonesandKoss SPARKPLUG - Stereo In Ear Ear Plugsphones.  Both provided far superior noise reduction; the Shure qualify as a deluxe set of earplugs, very nice on airplanes.  The Shure provided much better sound quality, the Koss was about the same sound quality.  Both were better construction (though both were still broken within a year).  The Koss was about equally comfortable; the Shure was much more comfortable, due both to better design and a wider selection of earpieces.

The aesthetics remind me of an HTC EVO.  It is approximately the size of a tangerine when it's closed, which is a perfectly portable size.This thing can get extremely loud.  Even outdoors the sound travels pretty far and watch out when turning up the volume all the way inside.  I was wrong to expect so much from such a small device, but it is important to note that these speakers are very tinny.  Unfortunately, I can't use these for my personal listening because they absolutely despise bass.If you're looking to buy speakers to improve the sound on your laptop, look elsewhere!

I haven't had a Sony console since the PS2 and my most recent console was the Xbox 360.  The console arrived on time for launch day and was a breeze to set up.  The Playstation Network (PSN) was more than a bit congested due to the massive number of accounts hitting it within the 24 hour launch day.I was able to set up my console and download the initial software update with no problems.  Getting my PSN account logged in took a bit of time, but that was to be expected given the high demand for the system and large network traffic.  Since I couldn't access the store from the console, I opted to use the nifty feature of purchasing a digital game through Sony's website and setting it to download to the PS4.  That bypassed the traffic and immediately started the download to the console.  The play while you download feature is nice, but be aware that you need to download a specified portion of the game before you can start.  With a retail size game, that still takes time.  My example was Battlefield 4.  6GB is necessary to start playing.  You can then play single player while the remaining 33GB downloads.The hardware itself is pretty great.  I love the simple design of the case and the power is a sufficient leap over the previous generation of consoles that it makes it worth it.  The DualShock4 controller takes a bit of getting used to if you have been using an Xbox controller, but it's a great controller.  I haven't used the touchpad yet, but it's a potentially interesting feature.  The triggers are different, but I think they are quite adequate for my primary gaming need - shooters.The user interface is simplistic, but everything seems sorted into logical areas.  I've only got about 8 hours into usage, so my experience is still that of a new user.Included in the box is a 30-day trial for PS+, which is required for online multi-player.  You also get some pretty great games free every month.  I already have a favorite launch game and it was free - Resogun.  There is also a 30-day trial of Sony's streaming music service.  I tested it out briefly and it works well, though I'm not sure I'd subscribe to it after the trial is up.The best part is that I was able to set up a PSN account for my wife so she can access everything I can but there is no fee for her account.  Also, Sony has not put any of the media streaming services not owned by Sony (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, etc.) behind a paywall.  This simplifies multiple accounts on the console accessing streaming media.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend a Playstation 4 to people looking at upgrading to a next-gen console.\nquestion: Why is it a good hardware?",

Firstly, I purchased the product as a refurbished unit and only paid $75 including shipping - I added two additional batteries quite inexpensively through eBay.It is easily portable and seems to have fairly good battery time - here's a sample of 720 P quality - not bad.  [...]I suspect that this is a generic criticism as the small microphones embedded in this type of a video recorder has no resistance to wind.  What you can expect is that if you are moving and experience when passing across the microphone you will get wind noise.My original intention was to use this video camera on my bicycle and to that end, I constructed a helmet cam mount.  This would probably work but I found that the additional weight on top of my helmet was unacceptable - the camera weighs 4.4 ounces - seemingly trivial but noticeable on top of your head.  At five megapixels, the still picture capability is adequate but nothing special.  I chose to get a ZX3 as opposed to the newer ZX5 - there were several reasons for this choice:The ZX3 has removable batteries, the five does not.  The charge coupled device is larger on the ZX three and quite a few sophisticated reviewers felt that the ZX five was a downgrade in some respects.  And then there was the issue of a dramatically lower price.Summarizing, this camera is good enough and portable enough that I will often carry the camera in situations where I would have been lugging my Canon T1 I.

            "input": "review: REVIEWED BY LAURAFirst of all, let me address the elephant in the room. There's been a lot of buzz about the fact that this book wasn't popular when it was by an unknown author and then became bestselling after people found out it was written by J.K. Rowling. This has led to speculation about what this means for the publishing industry, what it means for unknown authors trying to get published, etc. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT. True, I may not have picked up this book if it hadn't been written by Ms. Rowling, but regardless, I did read it and I liked it, so there you go.Also, my husband kindly bought a copy of this for me on our recent trip to London, so I technically read the \"British\" version--I'm sure some things have been \"Americanized\" in the version available in the U.S., but I'm guessing there aren't any substantive differences.All disclaimers aside, I thought this was a really, REALLY well done private investigator procedural. The plot was exciting, and I thought the characters were marvelous. J.K. Rowling is such a keen observer of people, I think, and it really shows in her writing. Cormoran Strike, our hero, is perfectly flawed in just the way I love characters to be.There was such an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, unlike any I have ever read. Cormoran Strike is the private investigator, and Robin is a temp who shows up at Strike's office on a Monday morning. However, Strike thought he canceled the temp arrangement, due to the fact that he has pretty much no money. The scene where Robin and Strike meet (actually physically crash into each other) is just so perfect. There's nothing overtly hilarious about it, but I love how Rowling uses subtle humor. For example, soon after Robin arrives for her first day of work, a client shows up (an extremely rare event). Robin does not want to let on to the client that she is not the regular secretary, thinking it will reflect poorly on Strike. So she suffers through Strike calling her Sandra multiple times, and then asks them very professionally if she can get them anything to drink. They both ask for coffee with sugar:-------------He saw her mouth twist as she closed the door behind her, and only then did he remember that he did not have any coffee, sugar or, indeed, cups.-------------I know what you're thinking--oh the characters get together and it's a romance, too! Nope. That's part of what I loved about it--it's such an unusual relationship to write. The down-on-his-luck PI trying to solve a difficult case and his temp secretary who he's just met trying to assist him. So original.The central mystery of the story is very well done, and I kept flipping the pages faster and faster to try to get to the bottom of it. At one point, I remember thinking to myself, \"There are literally 15 people who I think are possibly guilty at this point.\" That's like Agatha Christie level of skill, people. It's Murder on the Orient Express, except, you know, without the train. And the way it did end I thought was completely masterful. Twist after twist and turn after turn, there is no way you will see it coming.We know Strike has a huge backstory, most of which we only get in bits and pieces throughout this novel. I guess that is my one and only complaint about this one--there were a lot of things that felt unfinished (and some parts that seemed like digressions from the main story)--but I suppose this makes sense for the first book in a series. I can't wait for future installments to find out more about what exactly happened to him in the army, why he left, more about the history between him and his ex-fianc&eacute;e, and to see if anything except mutual respect ever develops between him and Robin. There were also some interesting things alluded to about Robin's past, and I hope those are also explored in more detail.To me, the fact that this book is written by J.K. Rowling doesn't come as much of a surprise. Good writing: check. Well-developed characters with room for more development: check. Intricate and detail-oriented plot: check. Also, I read somewhere that if you think about it, the Harry Potter novels are sort of like thrillers/mysteries. So it's not surprising to me that Rowling can keep the page-turning suspense going, just using a slightly different medium.BOTTOM LINEI LOVED IT. I consumed like 100 pages of this book at a time. Seriously, if you are a fan of detective fiction, good writing, excellent characters, and a book that will continually keep you guessing, you should pick this one up. I personally can't wait to read more about the adventures of Cormoran Strike, PI, and am anxiously awaiting the second book in the series! Do you ever finish a book and then just really miss the characters and wish you were still reading it? And even if you pick up another book that is quite good, you sort of glance longingly at the previous book, remembering all the good times you had together? Anyone?RATING: A-\nquestion: Are the characters vivid and appeal?",

After coming back from a mission she sees through the glamour of the shape shifter who is impersonating her mother figure character, Raquel. Turns out the shape shifter is named Lend. He's male. He's hot. He is the love interest. Unfortunately you also have Reth (Lorethen) who is the evil/beautiful/scary Fairy who is basically trying to stalk her.  I might add right here that I much prefer fairies over vampires and find it so sad that they are used more in literature. Oh, and if your teen loves vampires - they LOOK like nasty rotting corpses to Evie. You might want to warn the teen in question.Anyhow this is the first book in a series so of course we don't get real closure. The whole idea of being able to see through glamour is not unique - it's in all the older fairy tales I'm glad to see it's making its way back into literature. The way the idea is portrayed though makes it make sense. I won't ruin the story by giving out spoilers to the rest just know that someone is killing paranormals as well as killing a large group of the International Paranormal Containment Agency (Evie's group).At the same time though I admit that some of the story felt very Mary Sue-ish. Finding Evie forces the whole Agency to become an international one as EVERYONE wants access to Evie. So in that - the book fails. Overall very good book, and I felt it was thin enough that you could probably get away with giving it to reluctant Readers.Before I forget- 4 stars for me means that I enjoyed reading it, but would not have it on my own personal shelf.\nquestion: Why do I have a pretty cover?",

            "input": "review: I first learned about this book through the National Novel Writer's Month website -- this book was listed as being written by a NaNoWriMo participant, and the author stated that this book was a product of said event.  Being a NaNoWriMo writer myself, I was heartened to learn that someone had not only published a book produced during the event, but said book had been successful enough to warrant bestseller status and a movie deal.  So I decided to check it out for myself, and see what a fellow NaNoWriMo writer had turned out.In the end, I found myself torn over the book -- I love it to pieces, but at the same time it frustrates me, though not enough to make me want to give it a negative review.The titular \"Night Circus\" is actually called Cirque de Reves (Circus of Dreams), a uniquely built circus open only at night and with attractions and acts that straddle the line between fantasy and reality, between the fantastic and the outright impossible.  Behind said circus are two magicians -- Marco, assistant to the circus' proprietor and the secret power behind maintaining and organizing said circus, and Celia, daughter of a famous stage magician and serving as the circus' illusionist.  Both are bound to the circus and are pitted against one another in a mysterious contest by their enigmatic instructors... but both end up falling in love, and seek to defy the rules of the game with potentially disastrous consequences for the rest of the circus.  Meanwhile, a farm boy named Bailey becomes entranced with the circus in general -- and with Poppet, the clairvoyant daughter of the big cat trainers, in particular -- and finds his own fate becoming entwined with that of the circus.Let me begin with the one thing about this book that frustrates me -- the main characters, Marco and Celia.  They are some of the flattest, blandest, most cardboard characters I have ever come across in a work of fiction, second only to Bella from the \"Twilight\" series.  They aren't annoying or pathetic characters, but they are so devoid of personality that it becomes difficult to care about them.  Most of the other characters, even the minor ones, have at least some personality to them, and I found myself more concerned with their fates than with the lovers/competitors who were the story's spotlight.  In particular, I loved Bailey, Poppet, and Poppet's twin brother Widget, and dearly wish they had been the focus of the story instead of Marco and Celia.  I was always heartened to see another Bailey chapter in the book as I read, while the Celia and Marco chapters didn't hold my interest as well, as the characters were too lifeless for me to be emotionally invested in them.That's my only quibble with this book, however -- the rest is one of the most enthralling and beautiful fictional worlds I have ever come across in a work of fiction.The circus is so grandly described, so beautifully built through Morgenstern's wordcraft, that I find myself wishing it existed in real life so I could pay a visit.  She describes not only the sights of the circus, but the evocative smells -- as one character in the book states, the sense of smell is an under-utilized but powerful sense.  And she makes it all seem entirely plausible and real, to the point where I find myself wanting to visit the Paper Menagerie, attend a Midnight Dinner, purchase a chocolate bat and a cocoa and go watch the illusionist or the contortionist at work, or even simply light a candle on the Wishing Tree.Of all the characters in the book, I think my favorite, besides Bailey and the twins, would be Friedrick, a clockmaker who becomes enamored with the circus to the point that he builds what can only be called a fandom around it (much like Trekkies are to Star Trek).  The collective friendship and brotherhood among these reveurs, as they call themselves, reminds me of the same friendship and brotherhood that exists among fellow fans of some of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.  But sadly, the main characters are so flatly written, so bland and uninteresting, that I can't give this five stars.  I do not regret reading this book, though, and despite the unengaging leads I will happily recommend it to those who like light fantasy and marvelous worldbuilding.\nquestion: Dose this character nice?",

At the end I noticed that I was going to underscore every single sentence of the last pages... so I just enjoyed reading then and bookmarked the pages.Thank you a lot for this book I am really waiting for your next one.I hope you will enjoy the read as much as I did.Please keep feel free to comment.

I don't want to write a long review, because the book has to be experienced, be loved, and be enjoyed on its own terms, because this is what it deserves.  The Help by Kathryn Stockett is about the black maids in southern US in the 1960s, their lives, loves, and despair, and about the white women that hire them, use them, depend on them, and sometimes, respect them.  I insisted on reading it before I watched the newly made movie based on it, so now I am ready.  If you have read the book, the movie is never better than the book, I think. But this book gets a 9 out of a 10, so I am not worried about the movie being really bad. I heard some had complained that a white woman shouldn't write a book about black women, but come on, that is the stupidiest thing I have heard.  If that is so, then women can't write about men, Swedes can't write about Norwegians, and black men can't write about white men.  We are foremost people, humans, and not our color, citizenship, or gender.  Compassion and understanding is deeper than skin color or culture, at least it ought to be.  So, if you want a great read, a good story, and deep thought mixed with fun stories, this is the book.  It is just like life is. Just read it.

There's no question that she can come up with some great humor and create comical situations.  And then the rest of the book rears its ugly head.For one thing, Lawson must find some way to moderate her excessive use of the F word.  The word itself is not funny.  If it is used as a shocker in situations where it's not expected and by characters not expected to utter it, the expletive can be humorous and the effect can produce a jolt.  If not, it becomes tedious and trite.  It ceased being funny after high school.Overuse of comments involving body parts and their functions is also a part of this book.  Headaches and nauseousness caused by overindulging in alcohol and illegal substances is more likely to be considered stupid than funny.  Reinvent your misery, Lawson, and present it in a more tasteful form.  More people are turned off by your puking than appreciate it.One more little annoyance surfaces here.  Lawson seems to have a need to broadcast what's coming up; to alert the reader that more funnies are on the way.  Good writers let their dialogue direct the reader through the orchard to discover the plums.  Be our guide, Lawson.  We are astute enough to decide what is golden and what is sludge.It's only fair that I point out some good material.  I thought her Post-It notes to Victor were hilarious.  Notably, the obscenities were used sparingly.  I also enjoyed her human resources experiences, probably because they didn't vary much from some of mine.  The chapter on housekeeping was funny, probably because I have relatives who like her style.  ODing on laxatives was great (I had to set aside my dislike for toilet humor here) as was the Halloween party of endless babbling and no underpants.  And finally, I really enjoyed the journal of her book tour because it brought back memories.  Was that you next door, Jenny?Jenny Lawson has a wide and rabid audience, based on the comments I've seen.  So, contempt will probably rain on me for this review.  I deserve it: I'm just an old fart without a life.  But I could also be a raging fan of Lawson's because I recognize the talent she has.

            "input": "review: For good reason, Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand landed on many Best of the Year lists in 2010, including on Mark's. I'm not sure I would have picked this up otherwise; I like World War II books as much as the next guy (if the next guy in question also likes World War II books), but this is focused on one man. And it's 500 pages. I wasn't sure that I was ready to commit.I'm so glad that I did. After a few pages, I knew that I would love this book. Unbroken is the story of Louie Zamperini, a hooligan-turned-Olympic runner-turned-pilot-turned-prisoner of war-turned- unbroken and hopeful man. That's a pretty good one-sentence summary of the book, just in case the publisher is looking for a subtitle for the forthcoming paperback version. I liked Louie instantly; he was a troublemaker tough-guy, but found his escape from his California town by running. Introduced to the sport by his brother, Louie runs in high school, college, and then in the 1936 Berlin Olympics where he met Adolph Hitler.His life changed soon after as the story follows Louie into his new career as an AAC bombardier, until he crashes in the Pacific. Louie and two others survive at sea for over forty days without provisions (with a troubling scene about a lice infestation in his newly grown beard). If the story ended here, it would be a powerful journey. However, it does not. Much of the book is his horrid treatment in several prisoner of war camps in Japan. Just when I thought all the evil happened to Louie, there is a new chapter of horror.The title is perfect to describe Zamperini. This man personifies courage, resilience, and hope in ways I have never seen. There were times I gasped aloud to read his ordeals. The squalor and suffering only provide a backdrop to allow Louie's courage and character to shine brightly.I hesitate to say to much to avoid taking away the suspense as you read it, but allow me to say that Louie continues to sink lower into despondency and hopeless until God intervenes. In literature, it's called deux ex machina; in life, it is called redemption.This book also has much to say about the many Japanese atrocities in World War II, whether it is in prison camps, Pearl Harbor, or Nanking:\"The Japanese military surrounded the city of Nanking, stranding more than half a million civilians and 90,000 Chinese soldiers. The soldiers surrendered and, assured of their safety, submitted to being bound. Japanese officers then issued a written order: ALL PRISONERS OF WAR ARE TO BE EXECUTED. What followed was a six-week frenzy of killing that defies articulation. Masses of POWs were beheaded, machine-gunned, bayoneted, and burned alive. The Japanese turned on civilians, engaging in killing contests, raping tens of thousands of people, mutilating and crucifying them, and provoking dogs to maul them. Japanese soldiers took pictures of themselves posing alongside hacked-up bodies, severed heads, and women strapped down for rape. The Japanese press ran tallies of the killing contests as if they were baseball scores, praising the heroism of the contestants. Historians estimate that the Japanese military murdered between 200,000 and 430,000 Chinese, including the 90,000 POWs, in what became known as the Rape of Nanking.\"This gives a more complete picture of the behavior and the attitudes of Japan, and why Hiroshima and Nagasaki were last resorts. Japan was on par of the atrocities committed by Hitler and Germany, and the two countries had more in common during treatment of people during the war than they differed. This concept certainly is not in our modern psyche. It is accepted (and often applauded) to denigrate Germany, but it is labeled as racist if we criticize Japan.In addition to the highlighting of a great man and as a history lesson, Unbroken is simply excellent prose. Hillenbrand has a poetic style of writing even the cruelest events.Examples:He felt as if he would faint, but it wasn't from the exertion. It was from the realization of what he was.One engine, for reasons known only to the plane, was thirstier than the others, so the gauges had to be watched constantlyThere was one perk to life in the barracks. The bathroom was plastered in girlie pinups, a Sistine Chapel of pornography.But it was good to feel oriented, to know that they were drifting toward land somewhere out there, on the far side of the earth's tilt.Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it. The loss of it can carry a man off as surely as thirst, hunger, exposure, and asphyxiation, and with greater cruelty. In places like Kwajalein, degradation could be as lethal as a bullet.The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when they make their tormentors suffer.Whether or not you are a fan of war accounts, go read this book. Like me, you will be mesmerized with Louie Zamperini for good reason. He is a man who stands above other men, and his story demands to be told. The more like Zamperini we are, the better the world would be.\nquestion: Does this story have depressing stuff in it?",

I wanted something that gave me the same feeling I had when I read FSoG or Crossfire Series......not the same story but the same feeling.  If I wanted the same story, I would have just reread FSoG or Crossfire Series.  I've been craving something hot, irresistible, sexy, controlling alpha male, and dark but with a fabulous story and even more fabulous writing.  I simply want to fall in love with the guy and the story.  Is that too much to ask for?????Well, I certainly found my WINNER.  Admit it - if you are a FSoG or Crossfire fan, then you use those as a benchmark for all others.  It's okay, admit it, I won't tell anyone.  (Psst).... I'll tell you a secret..... I freely (and proudly) admit that's what I do. There's a reason publishers put those stickers on books that make comparisons to FSoG.  Whatever the reason........ it sure as hell helped my choose Release Me!This captured my attention right out of the gate.  I didn't have to give it time or let it grow on me at all.  It was very engrossing.  The anticipation & build up throughout were amazing.  I was on the edge of my seat.The writing is polished with a wonderful flow.  The writing style is more sophisticated and intelligent with great dialogue!!!  The chemistry between Damien and Nikki is off the elemental charts!  OMG.  The hotness started off blistering in the limo and only continued from there. The sex scenes were beautiful, sensual, and erotic.Damien is the powerful, magnetic, beautiful, and seductive billionaire ex-tennis star that is used getting what he wants - and, that includes women.  The word `no' does not factor in to his vocabulary unless it's coming from him.  He's very possessive with the need to control everything and everyone around him.  Damien harbors dark secrets and is very good at keeping them just that - secrets.  He's one big mystery, revealing just enough to keep you wanting.  I'm dying to know what he's hiding.  The brief glimpses we do get of his vulnerability and his thoughtful gestures make him very likeable and real.  I even think I saw a bit of his heart peak through that stiff and hard exterior.Nikki is the beautiful ex- pageant girl with sass, smarts, and attitude to boot.  But, Nikki has her own secrets and demons - painful and dark secrets.  She's broken on the inside just as much as much on the outside although no one can tell.  Nikki uses her attitude as armor to protect herself.  Her strong attitude is refreshing, and her witty sarcasm had me laughing out loud.  It's nice to see a heroine that stands on her own two feet and isn't afraid to show her strong side.Damien and Nikki meet at a party and the attraction is instant.  Damien decides that Nikki's next on his list of acquisitions.  Nikki is more than attracted to Damien, but she isn't THAT kind of girl.  She does things on her terms and this presents a challenge for him.  Damien is relentless in his pursuit, and he soon becomes too much to resist.  Nikki wants this, but is this just a game to Damien???  Because to Nikki it certainly is not; it's very very real and terrifying .  If she pursues this is she ready for her past to come front and center?  Is she ready to give up control and let Damien possess her?It's very easy to ruin the story by saying too much more here.  I will say that their story is very passionate, and they very much understand one another.  Secrets, skeletons, insecurities, doubt, and second guessing run rampant, but there are touching and heart felt moments that make these bad elements fade into the background.  And, it's not all about the sex.  HALLELUJAH!!!  There was a nice balance between the sex and the story.  Sex was part of the story, but it never became THE story.  Nikki and Damien have a relationship, and that's what we get to see first and foremost.  I love this couple because they are both strong and smart with a vulnerable side.After all this you're still probably thinking been there done that, rich billionaire alpha male goes after a young, beautiful, nave woman.  THAT'S where you're wrong!!!  By no means is Nikki nave.  She's confident, smart, and doesn't allow anyone to make decisions for her, it's all on her terms.  And, that is why this is different.I know a lot of people hate cliffhangers or waiting for follow up books, but I'm glad this is a trilogy.  I'm loving this couple so much that it would have been a shame if Ms. Kenner tried to force their story to fit into a stand-alone book.  Their story is too involved and complicated not to run this over multiple books.Nikki and Damien's story isn't very heavy into BDSM if that's what you're looking for.  Yes, it's hot, erotic, and passionate with some kinky elements, but I wouldn't classify this as a BDSM or even light BDSM........ but, Release Me does give FSoG and the Crossfire Series a run for their money.I simply loved this book.  At times, I think I was purposely reading slow just so it wouldn't end.  There are certain books that I re-read occasionally just because I love the feeling I get from the intense feeling the characters have for one another.  Release Me is going into that pile!  I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment of Damien and Nikki!!!!!\nquestion: Why do they hide a secret?",

Life isn't all a bed of roses for everyone. And I like many others come from an abusive and violent childhood. My step-father didn't break things or hit other people, he hit me and my sister and my brother. The emotional, mental, and physical abuse he put us through was a nightmare. He appeared to be a great guy with a great life and no one thought differently. But I knew the monster he hid well. Travis's outbursts and breaking things is really nothing, he never hits Abby or any other woman. He is a bit possessive but he doesn't try to hide how he feels and is very aware when he messes up, I don't feel this books sends the wrong message.

            "input": "review: I think this book has been unfairly advertised in order to hopefully grab people who enjoyed the Harry Potter books.  when I was given this behemoth of a novel to read, I was told I'd like it because \"its a mix of Harry Potter and Jane Austen.\"  Its an entirely different kind of novel than Harry Potter; and the only connection to a Jane Austen novel would be that its set in old England and uses old English (\"chuses\" for example).  That said, the writing style is more in line with Jane Austen than some of the modern authors.  But, I wouldn't call this book Harry Potter done by Jane Austen.  Its also a fairly hard book to get into which is highly different from the pickup and readability of Harry Potter.I don't even want to talk about what the book is about and my recommendation is to not read the book jacket because it basically tells you the entire story.  Strange and Norrell tells the story of a magician, Norrell, who wants to bring magic back to England under his own terms.  But it doesn't start out like that.  It starts out with totally different characters who consider themselves magicians but don't practice.  Then it becomes a different novel about Norrell and his personal idealogies...then it involves Strange and tells his whole life history up to this moment before showing his ideologies.Part of the problem with the novel in its early pages is that it has a ton of beginnings.  It feels like the story will be about one thing but then introducing someone else gives another beginning to the story.  Its filled with too many false starts.  It also spends a large portion of the book setting up what will unfold in the last two hundred pages; in fact the majority of the story dictated in the book flap happens in the last half of the novel.  Fans of very pickup and read novels will probably be turned off early on.  Its a shame because this novel is very rich.It has a lot of subtext involving the time period (1800s) that fans/history buffs of the time period will enjoy.  I hate to call it a historical fiction, but it closely resembles this but with a fantastical twist (namely magic).  Susanna Clarke spends a good deal of time describing the time period, the setting, the characters, their motivations, etc that you really do get a good feeling for the characters.  She does a good job developing characters that will definitely have an idealogical and moral confrontation.  Clarke does tend to lean on cliches every now and then, what with the yes-men surrounding Norell and their tireless bickering on who's better.  Its handled deftly, but its still cliched at parts.My recommendation is that if you enjoy a quick read (and I don't mean page length) then I would just check this novel out.  If you are interested in devoting a good portion of your time to a novel that is thick with description, characterization and a plot that involves a ton of setup and involves a ton of characters that need to be introduced, then this is a good novel for you.\nquestion: How unusual is this book?",

            "input": "review: Torn from You begins immediately after that crazy cliffhanger from With You. I do recommend that you read With You first because I think it is important for you to understand the connection between Emily and Sculpt/Logan. You will find that their relationship is raw and intense.Emily&#8217;s is ripped from her simple life. She is thrust into a dark world that is dangerous, abusive and disgusting. She is at the mercy of evil men who want to train her and sell her as a sex slave. But when she thinks the man she has given her heart to is there to save her, she couldn&#8217;t be so wrong.When Emily realizes it was Sculpt who brought her to Mexico and he owns her, she is horrified. Everything that she had come to know has been torn apart. Emily&#8217;s heart is shattered and she has no other choice but to do what she has to in order to survive.Her days in captivity will test her strength and her ability to survive. The torture and torment that she goes through was heartbreaking to read. Logan owns Emily and she has to submit to him so that she is not sold to someone else. Raul who is the man in charge is evil to the core. He has agreed to allow Logan to have Emily but is watching them closely. Emily is torn between the hate she feels towards Logan and the guilt she feels for allowing herself to desire this man and continues to feel the raw and intense feelings she had when they first met. Ultimately, she does everything that Logan asks of her, although some is degrading and horrific, she has to survive and has no choice.As days slowly pass Emily continues to sink into her confusion with Logan. There are moments when she sees glimpses of the Logan she fell in love with but then it is quickly replaced with the cold and ruthless man who brought her into the darkness. She doesn&#8217;t know what to believe. He is protecting her from some evil things but why has he done this to her.&#8220;We were torn apart, because Eme &#8211; I&#8217;d never have stayed away from you any other way.&#8221;For me, the first part of this book was very dark and intense. I fell in love with Sculpt/Logan in With You then everything fell apart when I met him again in Torn from You. I felt the hate and anger that Emily did. But seeing bits and pieces of the old Logan gave me hope.The second part of the book took on a NA feel for me. I still loved it but it definitely shifted gears for me. It is 2 years later when we find Emily coping the best she can within the life she has rebuilt for herself. She has not had any contact with Logan and has no idea where he is. Her heart has mended a bit but she still carries around quite a bit of pain and anger from what she went through.Then one day Logan resurfaces again. Logan wants Emily back. He needs her back in his life. Emily is harboring quite a bit of anger and hatred. She is frightened of him. She hates that he reminds her of such a horrific part of her life. But Logan is willing to fight to get Emily back into his life. He needs her to understand why he did what he did and to let him help her heal.What we find out about Logan, his family and what he goes through is heartbreaking. But will what he tells Emily be enough? Is her heart strong enough to open up again and let him back in. We watch Emily struggle with her feelings but still stay strong. Logan is willing to do anything to get her back. Emotions are high and still very raw. We get some much needed answers but not without more crazy stuff.This was definitely a crazy ride for me. I loved Emily who was that girl who was beautiful on the inside and beautiful on the outside. She was a fighter and a survivor. She cared deeply. Sculpt/Logan was one of those characters that had me loving him one moment and hating him the next. He was intense and for me I thought he was emotional. He rarely loved and when he did he did it deeply.I also thought the other characters were great too. Some were a bit crazy like Georgia (who should probably lighten up on the drinking) but she was great. Deck was a badass and I loved him. Kat was an amazing friend and so was Matt. Crisis added a bit of craziness and Ream; I wonder what his story is.Looking forward to more things from this author!\nquestion: How twisted is the story?",

For me, the actual plot - which is sort of a spy thriller; part serious, part satire - was secondary to the writing and the characters. I didn't particularly care what they were doing. I just loved reading his words. His characters are vivid and unique. He has a true gift for writing dialogue and even his narrative sucked me in and held me in place.In all fairness, however, I must admit that the plot was at times convoluted in such a way that it could be difficult to follow. I think, in Laurie's effort to bring suspense to the story, he sometimes leaves the reader dangling in the wind. However, the entertainment value of his writing style carried me through any little rough spots in the plot.When I turned the last page, I was sad to say goodbye to the characters.

I went through so many emotions while reading this book. I laughed, smiled, gasped, got nervous, and was on the verge of tears, It was a roller coaster!I loved Camryn and Andrew. I loved how he brought out the best in her, made her feel alive, showed her what it was like to live to the fullest, no regrets, no worries, not to be scared to say what you want when you want to. He might have even taught me a few things ;) Andrew is pretty much perfect, sexy, sweet, caring, protective, funny...etc. I loved Cam too, I loved when she started opening up and growing into herself. She was relatable and I loved that.These two had some hard times and found each other at the perfect time, their friendship was amazing. I didn't really find the beginning slow, I felt like I was sucked in, living in the moment with them. We had to understand what it was that made Cam feel like getting away. I felt like I knew Andrew had a secret but wasn't sure what it was and when we'd find out. Then I was hoping I was wrong about the secret.This book teaches you to live, be you, don't worry about what people think, do what makes you happy, live your life the way you want to live it. Never have any regrets. Don't be afraid to love and to grow.This book also just stunned me speechless! But I also had my outbursts, gasps, my oh no's, my oh my gosh's, my aww's, you get the point. My poor heart was heavy and racing and it took me a while to calm it down. These characters and this story will definitely stay with you. I can't say how much I love it.

            "input": "review: The novel is a wild, trippy ride through the inscapes of the mind meshed with the story of one woman's struggle to relate to her loved ones and the world around her.Joe Hill writes a good story. I loved the idea of inscapes, and especially the call out to Mid-World from the Dark Tower Series. The overarching story of how Vic McQueen deals with her gift (or curse) and her conflict with the antagonist, Charlie Manx, drive the story.My main criticism is that at times I felt that the narrative could have been tighter, and in fact a review I read on Amazon nailed how I feel:'NOS4A2 is epic in length, but not in scope.'Vic McQueen is the best part of the story. She has a gift or a curse, depending on your point of view, and her life unfolds in response to this gift (or curse). Joe Hill nails the reality of mental illness with his portrayal of the evolution of Vic's character. I felt a great deal of sympathy for her and pulled for her throughout the novel. Vic is the classic tragic heroine.Charlie Manx is a real-life villain. What he does is horrible, but when seen from his point of view you can understand why he does what he does. You understand why he thinks what he does is right. In that way Charlie is not a caricature, but I never sympathized. There are points in Charlie's history where Joe Hill could have tweaked a few events and made Charlie a villain for whom you feel sympathy, thus making Charlie deeper, but that never materialized.Outside of Vic, the real delight is the idea of inscapes--how everyone has their own perception of reality and that each of our perceptions of reality are linked. These perceptions of reality can become separate worlds whose extent are limited only by our imagination. It's a powerful set of ideas that Joe has put out there.Unlike Horns, Joe Hill's previous novel, I was able to set aside NOS4A2 when I needed to sleep--except for the climax. The last hundred or so pages flew by.In the end what makes NOS4A2 a good novel is the sum of the positives. Like I said, the prose could be tighter, but the lead character, Vic McQueen, and the story itself pull this novel together and make it a good read.If you like Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere or The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King, I think you might like NOS4A2.I will say that after reading NOS4A2 I now want a Rolls Royce Wraith.\nquestion: Was the story magical?",

            "input": "review: Back in 1980, &#8216;The Clan of the Cave Bear&#8217; was published; it spawned a genre of prehistoric novels, none of which ever grabbed me the way that book did. Jean Auel not only put an incredible amount of research into her books, but her heroine, Alya, was one of the most engaging protagonists I&#8217;ve ever &#8216;met&#8217;. I followed the series as this Cro-Magnon superwoman survived being orphaned at age five and then being raised by a band of Neanderthals, learned to hunt, tamed animals, learned herbal healing, and so much more. Auel showed, in an entertaining way, how various things could have been learned and invented. I read that book at a time when I was going through a back to the land phase, and Ayla&#8217;s adventures resonated with me.I waited eagerly for each new volume. Sadly, the quality dropped as the series went on; the books started to drag. Still, I could not give up on the series, even though I didn&#8217;t get to reading &#8216;Land of the Painted Caves&#8217; until it had been out for two years. I kind of wish I hadn&#8217;t read it at all.There is little in the way of plot; Ayla and the First (the spiritual leader of the caves and her mentor) make a journey to visit all the caves with paintings in the area. There are some personal issues for Ayla, of course, but they seem contrived. And the book is extremely repetitious; every time Ayla is introduced (which, given the travel theme, is very, very often) her entire list of names and affiliations is given as if we have never read them before; as is the fact that she has an accent. We read about every person&#8217;s reaction to the horses and to Wolf. While it&#8217;s valid that people would have never seen tame animals before, we don&#8217;t need to know about every single reaction. Nor about every time Ayla brews up tea. It&#8217;s a huge book and I feel would have benefited from some serious editing.It is almost like Auel felt she needed to finish the series but didn&#8217;t really have it in her. It&#8217;s a sad ending for the Earth&#8217;s Children series.\nquestion: How good is the book?",

But &#34;Sky&#34; is raw, funny, and lovable all at the same time. And &#34;Holder,&#34; OH GOD Holder! I think I'm in love with him! He just has a way with words that are so completely perfect!If you are debating whether to purchase this book, don't debate any longer! BUY IT! You won't regret it!

            "input": "review: Sequels to stand out debuts often struggle to advance the series plot and recapture the magic of the first book. INSURGENT isn't one of those sequels. It's as powerful or even more powerful than it's predecessor. And considering how phenomenal DIVERGENT was, that's no small compliment.One of the most inventive and action packed dystopian series ever, INSURGENT picks up almost immediately after the end of DIVERGENT.  The factions that dictate every aspect of society are in danger and all out war seems inevitable. Tris's faction has ben split as too many members have turned traitor.  Power hungry Erudite have set their sights on the Divergent, like Tris, systematically rounding them up to kill...and worse.What continues to impress me with the Divergent series is the character arcs.  They are magnificent.  Tris transformed from the almost Amish-like Abnegation member to a brave and confrontational Dauntless member so convincingly in DIVERGENT, and her transformation in INSURGENT is no less impressive.  After the tragic choice she made at the end of DIVERGENT, Tris is plagued with guilt, self recrimination, and shame.  She isolates herself even from those she cares about the most. It's heartbreaking to read. And Tris isn't the only one who evolves in the book.  Characters who I thought were villains became heroes, and characters who I thought were trustworthy became villains.  Shocking doesn't begin to describe it.The beginning of INSURGENT was a little slow and not as easy to jump into as the debut, especially since the worldbuilding isn't really recapped for readers (like me) who could have benefitted from a refresher. But once I got my bearings, and the central conflict was revealed, INSURGENT was as compulsively readable as DIVERGENT.  And the revelations at the end were almost overwhelming--in a good way--considering their implications.  Bottom line, this is a series not to be missed.  The stakes just keep getting higher and I can't wait to dive into the third book in the Divergent series when it comes out in 2013.Sexual Content:Kissing\nquestion: What kind of storyline does the book contain?",

            "input": "review: In this book, Collins tells the story of Katniss, a young girl competing in \"The Hunger Games,\" a cruel, government-orchestrated fight to the death. The plot is as compelling as it is unsettling.This is a book you can't put down. The writing is excellent and the pacing flawless. The characters in general are nicely wrought. Collins keeps the reader fully engaged, trying to interpret and anticipate the moves of both the gamemakers and the competitors.Despite the wonderful experience of reading this book, I began to feel a sense of unease in the last thirty or so pages, the fear that I was about to be seriously disappointed. I hoped I was wrong. But I wasn't. I hated the ending. It resolved nothing.While I realize this is a series and the action resumes in \"Catching Fire\" and continues in \"Mockingjay,\" I feel authors of series works owe it to their readers to reward them at the end of each book with some overwhelming emotion, good or bad. In an epic story such as this, there needs to be some sense that the protagonist has come through some major life event that has changed him or her, prompted some sort of growth or... something. The unfeeling, jaded Katniss of Page 1 is pretty much the same girl the reader's left with on the last page. She's likable enough but still self-centered, still terribly immature and self-congratulatory. How much can the reader really care about this character and her relationships with others when, in the end, Katniss herself really doesn't much give a crap? And at the end, the story just... fizzles. I have a strong sense that this book ended at the wrong place. There needs to be some sense of closure, some feeling that the reader has completed a book. And, in the case of a series novel, there needs to be some major driving element that pushes the reader into wanting to read the next book. A bunch of unresolved loose ends, vague questions, and protagonist ambivalence, as we get here, simply is not good enough.The ending here was so BLAH that I was left seriously questioning whether I wanted to invest the necessary time to keep reading the series. I thought Collins and I might have different views as to what constitutes a book ending. What if the difficulty with endings was systemic and I got to the end of \"Mockingjay\" and was left going, \"Whaaaaattt?\"No reader wants to be left that way.But I cared about this series. I would love to love it.I decided to check out the reviews for \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay\" before I went any further with this series. I needed to know whether readers were more satisfied with the endings of \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay\" than I was with the ending of \"The Hunger Games.\" If they weren't, then I was unlikely to read those books.In fact, I wish I'd checked out those reviews before I started the series.Having completed my review of the reviews, I would suggest that strategy to anyone contemplating reading \"The Hunger Games.\" That way, you'll know what you're getting into before you're where I am now.Eventually, nostalgia may pull me back to the series and I'll pick up Book II. Right now, though, I feel too cheated and disappointed.With just a little more effort on the part of the author and editors, this could have been a phenomenal book.\nquestion: Is the book talk a good story?",

One of my favorite things about this book was the point of view.  While Slammed was from Lake's point of view, Point of Retreat is from Will's.  As much as I loved being in Lake's head, I loved being in Will's ever more.  I got to see some of my favorite Slammed moments through his eyes, which was huge.The biggest plus about seeing everything from Will's eyes was learning first hand how sincere and deep his love for Lake was.  While Lake might have been the one pursuing Will in Slammed, in Point of Retreat it was Will holding them together.  He did everything and anything in his power to be there for Lake in her time of need.  I really felt that changed the whole tone of the book. Lake spent most of the book withdrawn and angry.  She never really left the relationship, but there was a strain on it, and Lake wasn't emotionally able to deal with it. Will really stepped up and I adore him for it.I loved seeing Kel and Caulder again.  Those two boys are just as mischievous and adorable as they were in Slammed, maybe more.  I still wanted to give them big hugs and tell them to never change.  Of course I didn't get my wish 'cause the guys started to notice girls, but one of the swoon/laugh moments I had was finding out why they were suspended from school. I think it spoke highly of how Will and Lake were adapting to their new roles and raising their brothers.  There were also new people introduced in this book. I don't think the book would've been the same without Sherry and Kiersten.  Both brought a gravitas to the book that elevated it to a totally different level.Of course poetry is an important part of this book, but it wasn't as big a focus as the first one. Of course one of my favorite lines from this series come from a poem used at the end.  Once again Colleen's poetry is moving and flawless, just like this book.  I honestly thought I was going to have a problem writing a review for this book, but it just basically wrote itself. For me, Point of Retreat will forever be a book that evoked so many emotions, touched my soul, and made Colleen Hoover one of my must buy & must read authors.  Honestly, you'll feel the same after reading any one of her books.\nquestion: How to know if it is love?",

The book follows three women and how their seemingly unrelated stories intertwine to reveal a life changing twist.Summary:Story #1: Cecelia accidentally finds a dusty letter in the attic, written by her husband John-Paul, only to be opened after his death. While sharing this strange discovery with him, she senses that he is hiding a secret.Story #2: Tess, a working mother, learns that her husband Will has fallen in love with her best friend Felicity. Angry and shocked, she flies to Sydney with her son Liam to escape her wrecking marriage.Story #3: The death of her daughter Janie years ago always reminds Rachel that the murder is still out there, and her world is about to get crazy as she gets closer on finding out the truth.My Thoughts:The book's setting is very intriguing, and the story has so much potential. The author writes in such a smooth, natural way that allowed me to truly relate to these women. Character development is fantastic; the plot and the twists are really thought provoking. I did, however, find the first few chapters confusing when so many characters were introduced all at once, and it became difficult to differentiate all the names. The storyline was also tedious and boring towards the middle, but I definitely appreciated some of the deeper issues that the author takes on. The ending (epilogue) seemed somewhat abrupt but is very clever and ties everything together.As much as I wanted to love this book, it just felt a little short. Some parts were dragged out too much and the twist was also very predictable. Plus, I never fully understood the repetitive Berlin Wall reference.Overall, this is a nice read but not great literature material. I think for the right reader, this can be an amazing book, but unfortunately it's just not for me.

I also appreciated this book because the story raises a valuable question:  can parents be deemed neglectful or abusive if they truly love their children and believe they're doing the best for them, even if to the outside world their parenting seems remiss?  And is it maybe true to love is all a child truly needs, more so than even adequate food and shelter?

It is one of the BEST books that I have read all year.  I guess that everyone is different, but I can't believe that we were reading the same book.Jennifer Crusie's books ALL have great dialogue, but sometimes her previous books seemed just a little too &quot;dysfunctional&quot; in a witty kind of way.

            "input": "review: Have you read a book before that after reading &#8220;The End&#8221; all you wanted to do is fall to your knees, raise your fists towards the sky, shake them and wail &#8220;Why God, why?&#8221;. No? Then this is the book for you cause this is how I just felt after finishing &#8220;Raw&#8221; by Belle Aurora. With this book it took all my willpower not to lock myself in the bathroom while the family was celebrating New Year&#8217;s Eve just so I could finish it &#8211; needing to find out what happens next. This book destroyed me, it broke me. I felt as if Belle Aurora stuck my heart, my mind and my soul in a blender and set it on high and then just walked away. For the last quarter of the book and still about three hours later I was a sobbing and blubbering mess. It was so much more than I expected and I already had high expectations. This book evoked so many emotions in me &#8211; pain, despair, disbelief, contentment, happiness, hate, disgust, fear and a broken heart. The story gave me whiplash as I was basically torn between emotions on a minutely basis. One moment I was full of hate, the next moment that was replaced by sympathy. Then swooning like a love-sick lunatic, right before feeling appalled and out of my comfort zone. And I loved every bit of it.When Belle Aurora said that this is a story about a love gone wrong, she wasn&#8217;t kidding. I really should have believed it. This story is different and original. Not something I have read before. It is dark and twisted and transformed my brain to mush. Well, my heart too. And my ovaries suffered a little as well.It is the story of Twitch and Lexi. Each of them having lived through a difficult and tormented past and still managed to succeed &#8211; each in their own way. Their meeting and relationship is, well, let&#8217;s say unusual and twisted as hell. But that is to be expected if you develop feelings for your stalker. And that is exactly what Lexi does. Little does she know there is more to him than just some guy that likes to follow women around. And little does he know that she is the only one that can save him from himself. Their relationship made me cringe at times. I found myself shaking my head in disbelief, wanting to shake the characters to make them wake-up and see what was going on. This couple and their relationship is unique. I&#8217;ve never read about a relationship like theirs. And yes, at times it took me out of my comfort zone. But that means the book is good. It makes me feel and think new things, it makes me reconsider my point of view. Amazing, when a story can do this.I can&#8217;t tell you much more about the story without giving too much away. And that is not something I want to do. The story is too good for you not to experience it yourself.What I can tell you is a bit about the characters.There is Lexi. She is a woman to look up to. Having overcome pain and sorrow that her childhood and youth have been filled with, she is now someone who helps others &#8211; giving all her heart and soul. She believes in the good of people and doesn&#8217;t judge. I liked her character a lot. Despite what she went through she wasn&#8217;t broken. She was happy and loving, stable and caring. Her friendship with Dave and Nikki was absolutely adorable. But when it came to Twitch, that girl left her brain on the bedside table. Sometimes I wanted to grab her by the shoulders and give her a decent shake in the hopes of maybe bringing her brain cells back to life. But then I suppose the heart will win over the brain any time and there was not much she could do about it.Twitch on the other hand is one complex and twisted man. Most of the time I was torn between wanting to punch him in the throat or rip his clothes off. He was all domineering, controlling alpha-male with a big dose of bad-to-the-bone added to the mix. And yet, despite his often brutal, demeaning and heartless behaviour, I just couldn&#8217;t help but like him a bit. There was more to him than this sick-in-the-head man. And finding out what it was &#8211; that was excruciating as hell. I love that up until the end of the book, I could not make up my mind if I hate him or love him. But yet I couldn&#8217;t help wishing for him to be happy, not able to just think in black and white. Not able to just judge him. To make me feel like this about a character like Twitch, that was a job well done by Belle Aurora.The story will shock and rock you and trust me, you will love every second of it. For me, this is the best start possible to a new book year. Do yourself the favor and read this book.5+ unique, mind-numbing, heart-wrenching, sobfest-inducing, thought-altering stars.\nquestion: How rewarding is the story?",

            "input": "review: I had zero intentions to read this book originally. It just didn&#8217;t seem like something that would interest me. Well I don&#8217;t know if you have noticed, but I have been challenging myself to read stuff outside of my normal reading comfort zone.  Since that&#8217;s the case when this was offered by Epic Reads(Harper Teen) as a 68 hour free read online only, I jumped on it. My conclusion: I&#8217;m an idiot for passing in the first place. This book was fantastic and addicting and mesmerizing!Shatter Me is about Juliette, a girl that has been locked away in isolation for months because she possesses a power that frightens everyone around her. Juliette can kill people with the simplest of touches and because of that it has been almost a year since she had touched anything. Alone and scared Juliette&#8217;s world turns upside down when she is suddenly sharing a cell, and not just anyone, with a boy that may or may not be from her past. When things become even more complicated and Juliette finds out exactly why she has been locked up she must decide who to trust and just what she is willing to do to save her life and those around her.God did I love Juliette. She was such a great character. She had strength, but not too much so she was unbelievable, and she had vulnerability, but not enough to make her seem whiney. And she and Adam together were complete and utter magic. I could not get enough of their interaction. They played off each other so well and yet there was innocence to them even if you could constantly cut the sexual tension with a knife.  Add in the stress of Werner and you have a winning combination of awesome.  What really grabbed me though was the story telling. It was done in a way that I actually believed in the &#8220;fantasy&#8221; aspect which was what scared me away in the first place. Everything was paced nicely which added to the realistic feel not to mention the emotions all characters showed.All in all, this is a must read book and series. I have the second book waiting for me to read and I can&#8217;t wait to get to it.\nquestion: Where can I find book with excellent review?",

Each having their own unique story.  They have touched me and I know they will stay with me forever.  There were many wonderful messages throughout this book. Such as, courage, sacrifice, acceptance and redemption to name a few. Faith and believing when you have no proof.  Learning that there are lessons in loss and the powers love.  That there are silver linings!!! Sometimes blessings come from tragedies. Life is not easy and we make what we can out of it. To never experience pain, you can not appreciate happiness.Never judge a book by its cover. A face or body does not define the person or their heart! True love does not see a face. It feels the soul. True love doesn't fade with time...My favorite quote in the book:\"Love is not love which alters when alterations finds, or bend with the remover to remove: oh no, it is an ever-fixed mark, that looks on tempest and is never shaken.\" -  Shakespeare.God creates us all in the form we were meant to be.The book isn't just comprised of just heavy messages it was fun and playful too. I found myself laughing out loud. There are many sweet scenes as well.  It had broken my heart than mended it. By the end, I had tears streaming down my face. I'm glad I was able to experience it. I adore this book and recommend to all ages. If you have a daughter or niece ..have them read this book!\nquestion: How rewarding is the story?",

            "input": "review: I came across Atlas Shrugged here on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I read some of the reviews. Many people loved this book, and some people absolutely hated it. There was a real conflict going on. The one star reviews sighted an overly lengthy tomb that was preachy and highly opinionated with poorly drawn and poorly developed characters, unrealistic dialogue and confusing descriptions. The 5 star reviews touted amazing characters, poetic descriptions and ground breaking philosophy. But, it was the comments to the 5 star and 1 star reviews that got me interested. I read a comment on a one star review that the commenter thought the one star review was unwarranted and the reviewer needed to read some in-depth analytical books addressing this book and its author's philosophies - then re-read and try the review again (and that the second time around couldn't possibly be a low rating). Well, any book that needs other books to explain it and make it understandable and worthwhile does not sound like a good book at all in my opinion. Other commenter on the 1 star reviews basically said that the reviewers (and anyone who would rate this book low) were a bunch of closed minded sheep that COULD not or WOULD not understand the monumental, brand new philosophy in this book. Well, when anyone says that the reason a book is not liked is because of stupidity, ignorance or willful disregard, it makes me wonder - about both the book and the commenter. On the other side, the comments on some of the 5 star reviews accused those reviewers of being brainwashed cult followers. Overall, I was interested enough to read the sample on my Kindle. I wanted to know what all the controversy was about. I was pretty underwhelmed, and I have to say, I agree more with the 1 star reviewers than the 5 star. It was not well written, it was unrealistic in many ways, not believable at all, and was way too long. I was not fired up in either way. I do not vehemently hate it, nor did I absolutely despise it. I was pretty unimpressed, both with the writing itself and the concepts therein.As I said, the book is not well written. Many of the reviewers did comment on this, and the response from those who loved the book were often that English was author's second language so cut her some slack. I do not agree that that is an acceptable reason nor is it even a good excuse. A good editor or even a proof reader, even a few willing friends, could have cleaned it up. There is no reason why a book should be published like this. A few examples follow. Verb tense. Often the verb tense was inappropriate, especially when switching between past memory to current time. At one point, a character was thinking about an oak tree from his child hood (in past tense) and then this sentence \"He stood there for a while, making no sound, then he walked back to the house.\" Now, of course, after a moment of thought and a quick re-read, I figured out that he was still remembering a memory and not actually looking for a moment and walking back to the house NOW, but when there are multiple instances of verb tense mix ups throughout, it makes for a very confusing, jarring read. There are also many places were the wrong form of a verb or adjective is used, such as singular versus plural. An example: \"It was as if normal existence were (should be was rather than were) a photograph.\" And \"-not more than every fourth one of the stores was (should be were) out of business; its (should be their) windows dark.\" A proof reader or editor would have easily corrected this. Also, there were sudden point of view changes without indication or warning, one moment we are in one character's head, with their thoughts and feelings, and then we are suddenly in the head of another, then back again. Then, there is Rearden's name. He's referred to both as Hank and as Henry. Again, I figured it out, but there were a few pages where people were talking to \"Henry\" and I was thinking, did someone else walk in? I read back and forth, trying to find where it was explained that Hank was Henry, and couldn't find it. Earlier in the book, people would suddenly speak up that hadn't been initially described as being in the scene, so it wasn't unprecedented to have new characters show up without introduction.In addition, the sentence structure was rather cumbersome and confusing at times. Sentences are very long, repetitive and strung together with commas and semicolons.  Example: \"The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were rising itself, they were the essence and form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive.\" Or \"But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Eddie . . .\" So, were the yellow glints at the end of the street and did the glints catch his attention? Because, if they did, how can he look at Eddie at the same time he's looking at the glints? Were they supposed to be caught IN his eyes? I think so. Or \". . . not an active fire, but a dying one which it is too late to stop.\" This sentence indicates that it's too late to stop the fire, which doesn't make sense because the fire is dying. But I think what it is actually trying to say is that it is the dying of the fire that is too late to stop. There were instances of this thoughout the book, and it made reading it difficult because I found myself re-reading and re-reading, before I got it. You can't just read through this book non-stop with images and experiences running through your head, because the words keep getting in the way.I don't know about all readers, but I would guess many of them would be thrown off balance and just plain confused by the writing of this book. I was. I had a writing teacher once who gave some of the best advice I've ever gotten, \"You want readers to read your story not the words of your story. You want them to read without seeing the words. If they are seeing the words or worse, being confused and tripped up by them, then you have failed.\" That was certainly true for me reading this book. It was only a string of words without imagery that envoked no feeling.Onto the characters. I too found them to be unrealistic, contradictory, and poorly drawn. There were only a few types of people in this book, those portrayed as stupid, selfish (wanting things only for their own gratification) and charitable beyond any rational reason and those portrayed as cold, emotionless and selfish (wanting things only to feed their vision). I would agree with the other reviewers who said the dialogue was preachy, contrived and unrealistic. Example: \"Of what importance is an individual in the titanic collective achievement of our industrial age?\" or \"little slum children\", \"it's purely non-commercial\", and \"selfish greed for profit is a thing of the past.\", or this great big long, incongruous statement, \"I'm not going to requisition a new typewriter. The new ones are made of tin. When the old ones go, that will be the end of typewriting. There was an accident in the subway this morning, their brakes wouldn't work. You ought to go home, Eddie, turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band. Forget it, boy. Trouble with you is you never had a hobby. Somebody stole the electric light bulbs from off the staircase, down where I live. I've got a pain in my chest. Couldn't get any cough drops this morning, the drugstore on our corner went bankrupt last week. The Texas-Western Railroad went bankrupt last month. They closed the Queensborough Bridge yesterday for temporary repairs. Oh well, what's the use? Who is John Galt?\" Who says things like this? Nobody! People don't talk like that. They give speeches with that kind of language, maybe, but not talk to each other like that in everyday conversations.I found no new concepts in this book. The individual versus the whole, society versus industry, ect . . . Rand did not discover something new and reveal it in this book. Nor was her restated concepts portrayed in any realistic setting. The man who runs the train company is whining in response to urging to use a big, established, good quality supplier because the small company (low quality and long lead times that cost them months of time and money) should be given a chance. Or defending a failing venture in an undeveloped country because - shouldn't those countries have help and have modern facilities too? And he's telling his more efficient, hardworking and profit minded hardnosed co-owner sister that she doesn't understand or care about the human element . . . well, as far as business is concerned, of course she doesn't! And to portray any leader of a business as this man is silly. I work in a manufacturing field, and I can tell you, a vendor that provides high cost, low quality parts and is constantly blowing delivery dates is dropped. Same with business ventures, if something isn't making a profit, it goes. And what's this whole resistance to using the new type of metal? \"but - but no ones used this new type of metal before . . .\" Once again, businesses are always looking for the newest tech, the newest discoveries and inventions to make themselves bigger and better and give them an edge and make them money. This whole business set up in this book just seriously annoyed me. No business runs like that, it couldn't, and rendering one as such, even to make a point, just rang false for me. In the book, sentiment, affection, charity were portrayed as weak, negative emotions that none of the obviously strong, truly successful, hero characters had, even towards their families. The strong heros were condescending, arrogant and bitter.I did read the forward, which had some comments on Rand, as well as some explanations of her characters and the parts they played. Again, if I have to have things spelled out before hand and be TOLD (because it's apparently not clear enough in the book itself) what something ACTUALLY means (because my own ability to drawn my own conclusions must be faulty or my willful ignorance might make me ignore logic and reason) then I suspect there is something lacking in the book itself, either in the nuts and bolts of the writing or in the characters or plot. I found all that to be true in this instance. The actual structure of the writing was confusing and repetitive as well as contradictory, and both the characters and the plot were unrealistic, unrelatable, inhuman and also contradictory. Clarity, concise and realistic dialogue, sympathetic characters, believable plot/people/motivations/actions were all lacking. As a story, it is not something I want to read. As a philosophy, it was nothing new or groundbreaking, that I need to read, and certainly don't want to if its not well written.Quote from Rand: \"I seem to be both a theoretical philosopher and a fiction writer. But it is the last that interests me most; the first is only a means to the last . . .\" Well, this book is not evidence that supports this statement. It is the exact opposite, in my opinion. This fiction book was not a vehicle for her philosophy. Her philosophy was a vehicle for this book. That was evident to me in the preachy speeches of the characters and the unrealistic mold every scene was shoved into. She did not use her fiction to tell about a philosophy but rather used her philosophy to tell a story. Everything was drawn and built to fit that philosophy.Quote from Rand: \". . . creating a new, original abstraction and translating it through new, original means. This, as far as I know, is only ME - my kind of fiction writing . . . May God forgive me if this is mistaken as conceit. As near as I can now see it, it isn't . . .\" Well, I saw nothing new or original in the philosophy and certainly nothing new in this book, and to think it is, to judge one's own work as such, sounds conceited to me. And, in reading Rand's other statements in the forward, she certainly left me with an impression she is an elitist, arrogant, condescending and bitter woman, just like the heroes she created. I will definitely not be paying the high Kindle price to read the rest of this book.This all makes me sad, in a way. There were moments and certain descriptions that were like breathtaking snatches of sunlight and left me thinking - wow, this woman could have been a great novelist. With a little editing, a little less soap box preaching, a grounding in realistic, believable settings and characters, she could have written a tremendous book. There is talent here, but its warped and lost in the extrusion through her narrow and bent mold.\nquestion: How good is the story?",

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation.\nquestion: Does the chips a good cooking point?",

The pyramid pouch is attractive but I think other fibers decompose more quickly and would prefer those or a reusable strainer.  It's not a deal breaker, just an observation.  If you like the scent, you can use it unbrewed as a sachet I guess.  Being that it's a fruity herbal tea or tissane, I personally find that it needs no sweetening and I've yet to add milk.  It's lovelier as an iced brew for my preference, and I think the vanilla essence is lacking unless I steep the tea for a longer time than usual.  I also have found that a single brew is best as opposed to a second dip which is possible for other tea bags.  The tea isn't bad, I just think it's average and haven't awarded it a higher star rating.  If you are looking for a fruity tea that is even better iced, give it a try.

But the first taste was better than I expected.The lightly sweet raspberry taste is front and center, with a hint of smoky flavor and a touch of gentle heat.  The ingredient list is short and simple--the first three ingredients are sugar, red raspberries, and jalape&ntilde;os.  There are no preservatives and no corn syrup, so this simple sauce lacks the added funky flavors and aftertastes that many other sauces have.The flavor of this sauce is so uncomplicated and good that I want to try other Fischer & Wieser sauces.  I've just subscribed to theirUltimate Sauce Gift Pack,a pack of six bottles including two bottles of Raspberry Chipotle.  I'm not a big fan of blueberry (ok, I admit I'm planning on giving that one away,) but the other sauces look promising. especially the Asian Apricot Stir Fry & Dipping Sauce.To try this sauce, I seasoned boneless pork ribs with rosemary and put them on the grill.  When they were done, I coated them with this sauce.  There was no need to cook the sauce, I just let it get to room temperature so it wouldn't cool the hot food.  The flavor was perfect with pork, but I can see that it will work well with chicken, and would be great on a salad, mixed with some rice wine vinegar or balsamic or cider vinegar.I've got to save what's left of this bottle, though, because friends will be visiting soon and I plan on drizzling this over cheese and crackers.  The included recipes suggest cream cheese, but I'll try it on brie and cheddar, too.4/5/09 UPDATE: I smothered a huge wedge of brie with this sauce and brought it to a party.  An hour later I wandered back into the room with the food, and I'd swear the platter had been licked clean.

If I licked the bowl when I was done, I would never admit it here.I didn't follow the instructions.  (I'm terrible at following instructions.)  I started at the supermarket, while choosing the beef.  This calls for thin slices of beef tenderloin, but that's not exactly in my budget.  I went with chunks of a fairly tough cut of beef.  That meant long simmering, which is not what the instructions call for.I lightly browned the beef and set it aside. (The instructions tell you to pan-fry until medium-done.)  I added the paste and coconut and brought it to a boil.  (Hey, I got something right!)  The \"coconut premix\" was a powder that clumped pretty badly.  I think next time I'll add the coconut premix and the water, so I can see the clumps to break them up, then add the paste.I added the beef back to the pan and covered (which you're not supposed to do,) and let it cook for about an hour and a half.  With tenderloin it would be ready in a few minutes, but if you're broke like me, the sauce holds up well to cheap beef and a long slow simmer.The smell in the house was absolutely wonderful.  The flavor was wonderful as well.  It was a good blend of spices, with no one spice stealing the show.  I know that rendang is supposed to have hot peppers, but I don't know exactly how hot it's supposed to be.  This was extremely mild.  Leftovers may meet a littleSrirachato warm things up a bit.

I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.\nquestion: How fantastic is the aroma?",

I marinated it for two days and then grilled it up (just missing a very heavy snowstorm...though snow wouldn't stop me). I was pretty impressed with the way the venison came out. It really did a great job taking away any of the gamey taste, without having to use a better wine or brandy (what I used to use). The sweetness was a very nice addition, and well balanced. It was not overly acidic, and the meat was very tender. I have tried this on salmon, and again, I was very happy with the taste. I usually prefer a milder fish like Chillean sea bass, swordfish, tuna, or even fresh cod. This may end up being my new Ketchup (put it on anything and it tastes better). :-) The cost does seem a little high, but really, you get what you pay for, and here, you are paying for quality. I have also tried this as a salad dressing with pistachios and walnuts, feta cheese, spinach, pear slices and lettuce, and it was also great. If you are not allergic, try it, it's a great alternative for tradition mixes and flavorings!\nquestion: What is your favorite beer flavor?",

I had no idea what to expect but was intrigued by the idea of organic vegetables and spices blended together to create brand new experience. Numi Tea has created six blends to appeal to those brave enough to try it & what better way the with the Savory Tea Garden Sampler.The box contains 6 flavors and 12 tea bags, so you can have a cup for yourself and share if you so choose. The blends you'll find are Carrot Curry, Beet Cabbage, Tomato Mint, Spinach Chive, Brocoli Cilantro, & Fennel Spice. The tea is 100% organic as well as non-GMO verified. Each flavor inspired from recipes around the world.I think the sampler is a very good option if interested in trying these teas out. I say that because I honestly really liked some better than others. To each their own taste, I say though. My favorite out of all six is the Spinach Chive! It leaves an aftertaste like if you were have spinach and chive dip just without the added sour cream. And the Tomato Mint was another that I liked, being the mint lover that I am. I was kinda upset I didn't like the Carrot Curry flavor more. I felt it needed to be a bit spicier and the carrot stronger in taste.The flavors of the teas aren't overly strong as one would have assumed from smelling the tea bag. I was a little shocked thinking they would have tasted more like broth or soup. I was hoping it would have been a bit stronger. I will state that each flavor tasted exquisitely fresh and quite distinct though. No sugar or cream is needed and the teas can be drank hot or cold.I'd recommend trying them out if you are looking for something different. They compliment certain meals in my opinion quite well. I think they may also be an interesting addition to your cooking.  You may just discover and brand new tea obsession. But do try out the sampler pack first!\nquestion: Was it a good flavor?",

But living in hurricane country on the Gulf coast of Florida, I do like to have some kind of food bar on hand in my hurricane pantry along with my other emergency supplies.I was excited to findPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and have not been disappointed in the least. First of all, PURE meets all my dietary requirements for food bars: it must be organic; it must be raw; it must be vegan; it must be gluten free; it must not contain GMOs, preservatives, soy, refined sugar or trans fat; it must taste good.These chocolate brownie bars are the best! I agree 100% with reviewer Tennyson E. Stead who stated so well that these are the \"closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.\"  Really!  A brownie doesn't get better than this! The Pure Bars are small but dense and quite satisfying although I could easily eat two at a time. They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I've experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I'm happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season!

This drink is lightly carbonated, much less than a standard cola drink, but the carbonation transforms the drink from a juice-like, powdered drink type to a much more refreshing, original beverage. The drink is not overly sweet, but just enough to enhance the watermelon-strawberry flavor, and not too caloric. I am anxious to try the other flavors.

I also greatly dislike carbonated drinks.  When I saw this Essentia product, I was very curious to give it a try.  Through the years, I have tried many different brands of bottled water.  Some have a \"soapy\" taste, some have just a plain weird taste and others are not bad.  Where does Essentia fall into?  I would have to say that it falls into a category that ranks high on my taste bud o meter.The bottle claims that it has a silky smooth taste.  I don't know if I would say that, but it does have a very crisp and fresh taste to it.  I spent the afternoon outside mowing (on a rather hot day) and when I came in, I cracked open the bottle of Essentia.  It was delicious.  Now, of course I was dying of thirst, lol.  An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.

I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of \"more is better\" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%.\nquestion: Is a delicious chocolate?",

This tasted pleasant enough for energy drink standards and what I mean by that is that it didn't make me gag.  It claims to have about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee but to me it felt more like a mild cup of tea.  I guess if you are into energy drinks you can might want to give this a shot but it didn't leave me with a desire to try it again.\nquestion: Does it have a strong taste?",

            "input": "review: OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr.\nquestion: Does hulled seeds are full of nutrients?",

What if we are the children of unknown fathers? For answers please consult Frankenstein. For self-important, barely comprehensible drivel please consult Prometheus.Great direction can save poor scripts. A director seduced by CGI shooting an incredibly weak screenplay by an overrated pair of writers will not. How on Earth Lindelof and Spaihts got the gig is beyond me. There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.\nquestion: Is this storyline interesting or strong?",

I feel Paul Bettany was overlooked at the oscars, as was Russell Crowe who deserved that oscar a million times over.  His performance was moving and emotional, a flawless piece of art.  Jennifer Connelly well deserved her oscar.  She was stunning as usual and she was well matched with Russell since the two of them steal every scene they embody.  This is just a great film, period.  The film revolves around the true life story of John Nash, a famous mathmatician who suffered from scizophrenia.  The movie starts while John is in college searching for his origional idea.  He finds it, and ends up working as a teacher/informant kinda sorta for the government, making frequent trips to the pentagon.  He meets and falls in love with a student (Connoly) and they are married and soon she is pregnant.  That's when things get hard.  Nash gets a little paranoid beliveing the Russians are trying to kill him.  Soon he is in the hospital undergoing some primative electric-type therapy to cure him of his mental state.  The balance of the movie shows Nash's road to redemption and that road is long, hard and bumpy, but worth the ride.  Crowe's dedication to his roles is evident in the enjoyment you recieve from watching him on the screen.  Keep it up Russ.  This film ends on a happy note, a note actually so happy and heartwarming it may bring you to tears or at least give you the motivation to get up and clap.  If you want to see a film that will make you think, make you cry and make you smile then this is the film you should see.\nquestion: Is the direction of the movie fantastic ?",

            "input": "review: This series I bought from Amazon, but seasons 2 and 3 I have actually seen on TV.  As it turned out, in my opinion (because the series has ended now) it was a down played spin off of &#34;THE TUDORS&#34;.  I'm not particularly into the Renaissance, but the history of the Catholic Church during that time does intrigue me.I have tried not to compare it to THE TUDORS, but I didn't succeed there.  Like THE TUDORS the actors and actresses were all first rate, excellent actors and actresses. Jeremy Irons is a living legend and the most known of the cast. Colm Fiore is an excellent actor, and the rest of the cast was no less radiant.  The sets and costumes were spectacular without a doubt.But unlike THE TUDORS, THE BORGIAS series still lacked &#34;something&#34;.  I want to say that it didn't have quite the same sexual tension and intrigue that THE TUDORS had.  And, I want to say that the cast of THE TUDORS was just a &#34;little bit better&#34;.  JRM almost &#34;over acts&#34; as Henry 8th, but his sex appeal and magnetism makes that series. And quite frankly, THE TUDORS was in no short supply of beautiful people.The only thing that made me uncomfortable was the season ending.  I won't mention exactly what made me uncomfortable because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't yet seen the whole thing, but I will say, I felt that the series ended rather quickly and abruptly.  Over all though, it was a very fine series.\nquestion: How good is the costume?",

            "input": "review: I have seen a lot of horror flicks and suspense/thrillers in my day and the first 21-mintues to When a Stranger Calls easily rates as possibly the very best first act I have ever seen. From the way it was written, shot, scored and acted there is for me no doubt it's just simply perfection. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The phone calls may not be the scariest in the sense that the caller at first doesn't say anything threatening or even sexual.Each minute of the first act raises the tension unlike any horror flick I have ever seen. By the time you reach the end of the first act you'll be held in such suspense that scaring you is now simple. Any filmmaker can create a jump scene where the killer or ghost or whatever pops out of the corner. Most of the time jumping back is just simply a reaction. How many movies have you watched where you jumped back, but weren't scared at all? It's just a reaction and any filmmaker can do that regardless if they are good or a hack.That is why I normally prefer movies like this that are a bit more subtle. Problem is though after the opening act business does indeed slow down. Most people say the middle sections are boring and it's kind of hard to argue with them. Though I will say the middle sections of When a Stranger Calls does get better on multiple viewings. The filmmakers did such a great job in the opening act that we the audience are on such a high that anything afterwards is bound to be a let down.The screenplay written by Steve Feke and Fred Walton was overall pretty good; the first act was very well written and extremely creepy, but after that the movie changes focus. It seems the story will be built around Jill Johnson played by Carol Kane, but instead the movie focuses on the killer Roy Duncan played by Tony Beckley and a private detective named John Clifford played by Charles Durning who is on the hunt for the psychotic killer.When a Stranger Calls isn't the typical horror movie, yes I consider it a horror flick for the sole reason the movie does aim to scare you. Not in the typical horror movie way, but with more suspense. Some suspense flicks have nothing to do with horror where as others play off some kind of primal fear often found in the horror genre. The 2nd half becomes more of a crime drama. We follow Roy Duncan and to be honest the guy is quite pathetic.Feke and Walton take an interesting approach; Duncan is obviously a psycho but he's so pathetic we almost feel sorry for him. But the man is a child killer and I cannot feel for them. They are the lowest of the low. He's homeless, broke we see him get beat up and later beg for money. Hardly the typical movie villain; problem though is he's just not an interesting enough character to follow around. Tony Beckley does an out-standing job. There is no denying his talents in this movie as an actor. But the character just simply was not interesting.Charles Durning does a great job though at carrying the movie. He is the more interesting of the two characters and his obsession with finding the killer is entertaining. But what went wrong with the middle sections? Simple it goes back to the killer just not being interesting enough. For almost an hour of the movie it's John Clifford hunting down Roy Duncan. While it's not as boring as some people make it out to be, I do think Steve Feke and Fred Walton could have done more. Their screenplay does seem to drag in some spots and by a certain point the movie does sort of repeat itself, but thankfully the final act gets back to Jill Johnson.I didn't hate the middle sections, but they weren't as strong as they could have been. I personally always felt the movie should have been Jill's story with Roy Duncan being in the movie a little less. It would suck to lose the scenes with Charles Durning because he was so great same goes for Tony Beckley, but I personally think making it Jill's story and use Clifford and Duncan as more of a sub-plot would have worked better. The remake attempted to do just that and failed big time.As stated earlier the opening act was just brilliant; director Fred Walton gets the most out of every single shot and raises the suspense and tension unlike any movie I have ever seen. Like I said anybody can do a clich&eacute;d scare movie, but it takes real talent to do what Fred Walton did. The 2nd half while yes does lose a little bit of steam, Fred Walton is still able to keep the suspense level at a decent level. The scenes with Colleen Dewhurst who plays Lisa are well done overall and remind us what kind of movie we are watching. The hour mark features a great and creepy scene with her and Roy Duncan. Though when all is said and done the Lisa character seems nothing more than filler scenes. It never really goes anywhere, but does provide some decent suspense.The final act is when things really pick up and we return to Jill Johnson who is now married with 2-kids of her own. Besides the opening act, the final act is the most solid. It goes back to being very creepy and while it does lack compared to the opening it does give us some chills and thrills. Like I said before I do believe When a Stranger Calls is a movie that needs multiple viewings. The opening act was so brilliant anything afterwards is bound to bet a let down. It might be boring at first, but when you see it again you might be able to appreciate it a little bit more. I've come to enjoy the middle sections even if it wasn't as good as it could have been.Carol Kane was great and I do believe the movie might have worked better had the focus been more on her and use Duncan and Clifford as a sub-plot. Kane does appear in half the movie actually. It's just she's used in the opening and ending, which results in roughly 40-minutes or so screen time, but since it's so far between it seems like she's barley in the movie.Despite some problems with the middle sections, When a Stranger Calls is a highly suspenseful and very creepy movie with excellent performances. I'd advise those who felt the middle sections were boring to give it another try. It does grow on you and for those who haven't seen it just expect more a crime/drama with some suspense thrown in during the middle. But the opening and closing act just might be the best you'll find in this genre.\nquestion: How good has this movie been until the end?",

Dont get me wrong- I'm not a sick f***, but sometimes thats the kind of movie i wanna see.

            "input": "review: While watching \"The Ring\", the last thing I wanted to do was to draw comparisons with the original Japanese \"Ringu\". Simply because I wanted to enjoy it as what it is, rather than a revisited English version of a same film. Unfortunately, I found comparisons to be inevitable. Not saying that \"The Ring\" is either superior or inferior, but it stayed very truthful to the original material it was based on, too truthful.For viewers who haven't had a chance to see \"Ringu\", you will find idea of \"The Ring\" wholly unique, nevertheless bizarre and ridiculous at the same time, depending on your cynicism level. But for those who have seen the original, you may think that the story of this US remake unfolds in an almost identical way, even though some incidents along the way were inserted or slightly altered to cater for the vaster audiences. In certain cases these alterations are actually an improvement that contributes to the mood of the story, as well as providing hints and clues of the final conclusion. In Japan, like in China and many other countries in Asia, they have long history that consists of countless mythical tales and legends about the spiritual realm, so a cursed video may seem vividly possible, while seems far-fetched and hard to swallow to the English-speaking world. But in order to retain that sense of myth, a lot of elements converted (or rather not converted) into the US version do feel quite out of place.Verbinski, while flaring some ingenious camera setups, did not tackle the subtlety a movie that is largely atmospheric requires. \"The Ring\" is a material which M. Night Shyamalan could probably do while he sleepwalks, and his knack for psychological thrills and minimalism style would surely be effective here. Perhaps looking at Verbinski's r&eacute;sum&eacute; (Mousehunt, The Mexicans), he may be too cynical for a subject that deals with a video tape that kills people. However with the limited amount of Gore (no puns intended), he did succeed in letting some genuine chills creep into the audiences at the sublimal level.Where \"The Ring\" did fail is, not having convincing characters. Naomi Watts serves up a decent job as a career-driven news reporter, but she did not look frightened or concerned enough for a single-mother who knows her exact time and date of death. There was no sense of emergency that she is desperate to find out how to lift the curse, instead she spends the entire time questioning who was involved in the sad story behind the video. By the end of the seventh day the audiences are left to wander off somewhere forgetting why she needs to find out about the origin of the video in the first place. Secondly the son Aidan is too creepy, and without a trace of innocence for us to really care about what will happen to him. He shares no chemistry with his mother, spending the entire time staring into the far place, drawing dark pictures, or mumbling something about a imaginary friend. In another word, he seems more like a possessed puppet than your little nephew you would like to take to the carnival. In Alejandro Amenavar's \"The Others\", in Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\", or even in the most obvious example, Shyamalan's \"The Sixth Sense\", children's straightforward manner and innocence proved to be far more effective in creating sense of peril, and in that matter, way more disturbing. Another disappointing performance is from Martin Henderson as Noah. He has great presence, but again he does not convey any chemistry with the other actors in the film. The expression he has for not believing the nonsense of a killer video is not so different from the one he knows his life could be in threat. Is he helping Rachel because he does have feelings for her, or does he just hope to get laid again because she is still hot? It was not explained, nor do we really care much.Though the number of extras on this DVD is disappointing, what it does offer is in fact quite neat. The picture is sharp and crisp, providing a good contrast of the grayish grim look of the film, with the bursting colors at times that will permanently damage your retina (in some way it actually distracts you from the mood the film is supposed to have). While the sound may not give your system a throughout workout, the localization is quite well defined, and provide a good dimension for the otherwise monotone sound effects, therefore making the few shock-tricks exceptionally powerful (needless to say the DTS track again proves to be the champion of cinema sound).An advertised \"never-before-seen short film\" could be seen by selecting the \"Don't look here\" option on the main menu. It is in fact a collection of deleted and extended scenes, featuring a few more graphic sequences trimmed from the theatrical release. Without commentary or additional information, it doesn't really reveal any more insights or secret than the film itself, but would definitely affect the rating if they were incorporated back into the film as an \"uncut edition\". Yet whether it would be a better viewing experience is another question. Also included is a very brief trailer of the original \"Ringu\" on DVD (also released by Dreamworks, surprise, surprise!), a theatrical trailer of \"Catch Me If You Can\", and an \"8 Mile\" DVD promo spot. If you are patient enough to play around with the remote a little bit more, you may find a not so pleasant easter egg! Overall \"The Ring\" DVD is a nice little package that will make your collection looks better...is that your phone ringing?\nquestion: What quality is the work in this movie, is it excellent?",

It is also a smart and well-photographed movie that proves the old adage of depending on the use of a great story and then embellishing on it with all the bells and whistles. The plot is as believable as anything can be that posits the existence of people so smart, so devious, and so daring as to be able to do some of the things that are done here. Yet the qualms about believability quickly fade with each nosiy and exciting revving up of the action, which is well choreographed, full of pyrotechnics, and absolutely fresh and new, adding to the charm of the movie.The cast adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie, with Donald Sutherland, Ed Norton, and several notable others lending both credence and a certain gritty feel to this tale about life on the margins, on the far side of the law. I also got the impression that given the box office success of this film; much of the crew may be back to thrill us again in an inevitable sequel. I am up for it. After all, given the aplomb and cool they displayed in driving a trio of Metros through the streets, sewers, and tunnels of Los Angeles at rush hour, and added into this mix was a certain level of style and intelligence often missing in such caper flicks, it would be fun to consider a series of such films.

Sure, they could have given us more--four different kinds of trailers, costume design boards, a scene from every Phantom movie thus far, interviews with Crawford and Brightman, not to mention commentaries. But hey, isn't that what Christmas is for? :)However, I was enthralled by the story of how the musical came to be. We get not only plenty of airtime from Lord Webber and Stilgoe & Hart, but we see the original stars in footage that we would never be able to see otherwise. Sara Brightman singing \"Pie Jesu\" in what looks to be a cathedral, Michael Crawford doing light comedy--light comedy!--on a British show and performing in the circus. We're taken into Webber's estate to view the singers who first performed the Phantom material as it was being constructed, and are enlightened as to how Britain charmingly previewed the musical, via music video, to the rest of the nation as what looked to be, quite literally, a rock opera. (Well, it WAS the 80s.)The other extras that focus on the movie production are also quite good. I thought it might be only a slightly longer version of one of those HBO First Looks, but it was super-informative. In it you get a look at the premier, at part of Emmy Rossum's screen test, the fun of trying to understand Jennifer Ellison's (Meg) accent, Patrick Wilson singing opera in sport pants, the Mask of the Red Death swigging from a water bottle, plus a look at the outrageously elaborate costumes and what the chandelier falling looked like in real life. There's so much more I can't remember, but trust me, it's worth it.I'm not sure sure about the additional scene. I'm glad they didn't keep it in. While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect. Because my first exposure to the musical was on a cassette tape with half the second act missing and it was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie. If you knew nothing of the musical before, then you'll probably like it, too.\nquestion: Is the costume not beautiful ?",

            "input": "review: \"Thank You for Smoking\" was an entertaining movie. I enjoyed the portrayal of corporate shenanigans and its satire of Hollywood types. The acting was good and all players did their jobs well but I was a bit put off by the smirking 'we're so smart and hip attitude' of the movie. A bit of humbleness is appealing you know. Some say the subject matter in this film i.e. to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed. I personally didn't feel that way at all. I felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking. Personally, I don't smoke but I don't mind that this film is for smoking. What I liked about the film is that it kept my brain going. And like I said majority of this film is predictable, but you do begin to question how free the rights of the American Public are? Should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too? Like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it. Why? The movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative views.It's nice to see Aaron Eckhart play a good solid role for once. I think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable. I think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies. William H. Macy also stars and shines yet again. Macy is one of the best actors in Hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves. Also Katie Holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable. I personally think Holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in \"The Gift\". The reason I think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like \"I want to f*** you, when I watch you on TV\" it seems out of the ordinary for her. This is also probably another reason why Tom Cruise loves her; she's probably a very bad girl outside the public eye.Even though this is Jason Reitman's first feature film he is one to keep an eye on. I feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father. Being that \"Smoking\" is his first film, I think he has already hit a home run. I think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is someday.I like the message behind \"Thank You For Smoking\" but not the overall subject matter of the film. This movie provides its audience with fine acting, a good script and some nice directing. The film's idea also keeps its audience thinking. It's a good movie to watch with someone and then have a nice long talk with about it afterwards. It's a satirical look at the smoking issue although I still feel it tilts more towards one side than the other. But at the end of the day, it's a good independent film which you will be able to enjoy and appreciate.\nquestion: Do you think this act is satisfying?",

As the writer indicates in the documentary, 'Alien Saga', the creature was inspired by a drawing of H.R. Giger and was intentionally intended to disturb the subconscious of the target audience (males aged 18-24) by the use of imagry that resembled the violence of male rape (forced oral invasion, resulting in impregnation, followed by a deadly painful birth of a phallic-shaped, flesh colored predator).  Unlike previous genre films, the protagonist also ends up being the female character - Ripley.  In any case, this is one of the best horror films of all time.Of special note is one of the deleted scenes included on this DVD (and presumably in the 'Alien: Director's Cut' to be released this month).  In this scene, the ship's captain who disappeared chasing the alien earlier in the film is found by Ripley, barely alive, cacooned by the Alien for insemination by a waiting egg.

            "input": "review: The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.\nquestion: What was an impeccable act?",

This is how the story goes: When the crew of the Enterprise is called back home, they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving our world in a state of crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction. As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left: his crew.The cast led by Chris Pine (as Captain James T. Kirk), Zachary Quinto (as Commander Spock), Zoe Saldana (as Lieutenant Uhura), Karl Urban (as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy), Simon Pegg (as Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott), John Cho (as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu), Benedict Cumberbatch (as John Harrison), Anton Yelchin (as Ensign Pavel Chekov), Bruce Greenwood (as Admiral Christopher Pike), Peter Weller (as Admiral Marcus) & Alice Eve (Dr. Carol Marcus) is excellent. The directing by J.J. Abrams (who also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay (based on the TV series created by Gene Roddenberry) by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman & Damon Lindelof (all three also produced the film, as well) is excellent.The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Dan Mindel is excellent. The film editing by Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey is excellent. The casting by April Webster & Alyssa Weisberg is excellent. The production design by Scott Chambliss is excellent. The art direction by Alan Au, Ramsey Avery, Steve Christensen, James Clyne, Kasra Farahani, Natasha Gerasimova, Michael E. Goldman, Andrew Murdock, Harry E. Otto, Lauren E. Polizzi & Jason Baldwin Stewart is excellent. The set decoration by Karen Manthey, set dressings by Rich Andrade, Maxwell Britton, Jack Cornelius, David Ladish, Steven Ladish, Chris Larsen, Michael C. Magno, Merdyce McClaran & Edward J.

The special make-up effects design by David LeRoy Anderson is excellent. The creature designs by Neville Page are excellent. The special effects coordinated by J.D. Schwalm, supervised by Burt Dalton is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Maren Dolzmann, Thomas Furukawa, Ali Ingham, Perry Kain, Zhunan Li, Mona Mohr, Trina Renee, Cara Samuels, Marlies Schacherl, Adrian Steel, Yinai Sun, Bill Wang, Shanshan Xie, Sarah Yunrong Yu & Momo Zhan, supervised by Kevin Baillie, David Burton, Simon Carr, Urs Franzen, Ben Grossmann, Jorn Grobhans, Alex Henning, Thomas Lautenbach, Sven Martin, Saku Partamies, Jason Richardson, Patric Roos, Benjamin Seide & Michael Wortmann is excellent. The stunts coordinated by John Stoneham Jr., fights coordinated by Marcus Young is excellent.This is an excellent, well-made and well-crafted (thematically and visually) movie and sequel that is just as entertaining and interesting as its original, possibly better than it. This is also another impressive entry in the Star Trek franchise. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto, among others, are back, reprising the roles from the original, just as well, possibly, better than the first time. Benedict Cumberbatch's John Harrison is an excellent and well-done villain, right alongside the Star Trek villains of the past. J.J. Abrams has crafted another entertainingly done film that is among one of his best movies of his career, beside the last \"Star Trek\" & \"Super 8\", also another well-crafted sequel on Abrams' resume, alongside, \"Star Trek\" & \"Mission Impossible III & Ghost Protocol\". This is one of the best movies of the year, so far, and it is also one of the best movies of the summer season, so far, as well, possibly, the best summer movie yet.\nquestion: What quality is the work in this movie, is it excellent?",

            "input": "review: Though Peter Jackson had always claimed that the 208 minute (roughly equal to \"Seven Samurai\" in length) DVD version of \"Lord of the Rings'\" first installment was not a director's cut, its vast superiority to the shortened theatrical release becomes clear immediately.For those initally dissapointed with \"Fellowship's\" overly fast pace (skipping over characterizations and details for the sake of action) , the seamlessly integrated 30 minutes of footage works wonders.Here are some Improvements:1) Instead of a mere adventure movie (or a cgi cartoon, some may argue), Jackson's FOTR now feels closer to the spirit of Tolkien's world. Through more maps, longer stays at various crucial locations, more journey time, more geographic and historical references, one finaly begins to get a sense of original work's epic scope. In fact, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is copied almost verbatim, and that's always a welcomed addition.2) Every character (even Gollum) gets at least some additonal exposure and all are considerably fleshed out. Aragorn benefits the most, now seeming more like a full-fledged human being (within epic conventions, though), rather than a straight-forward action hero. Galadriel, called a \"radioactive psycho\" by some, has other scenes here showing her true regal nature. Merry, Pippin, and especially Gimli, are more than buffoons to liven up the proceedings. Ian Holm's Bilbo, who was one of my favorite character portrayals in the film, also gets more screen time in the beginning, just like Tolkien wrote.3) The overall themes of the book are now much more apparent - the ring's temptation, the weakness of humans, the appeal of a simple lifestyle over industrialization, and the dissappearance of civilizations (elves). The Passing of the Elves scene, is quite amazing - a shame to have been cut in the first place, as it is fairly short.4) Some of the choppier and confusing parts of the theatrical version are elaborated upon and some questions are answered, such as \"How did the Ring betray Isildur ?\", or \"Why is Boromir so preoccupied with the Ring?\" Although Sam is not explicitly introduced as Frodo's servant, he is at least shown gardening at Bag End.Many complaints that I, and other fans of the book, had with the theatrical version are now fully resolved, and by all standards, as a whole this is a much better film, already approaching that sought-after but seldom-attained classic status in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Approaching, but still stopping short of perfection, because many of the fundamental issues persist.Here are my remaining Problems with FOTR in order of annoyance:1) Gratuitous use (or abuse, rather) of slow motion - esp. in the \"Noooooooooo\" scene right after Gandalf's fall in Moria, and the \"drowning\" of Sam scene. Cheesy and detracting.2) Overbearing, generic, omni-present score. Some scenes, like Boromir's attempt to take the ring, and his death, while well-acted, should have been fine without the bathetic, cringe-worthy accompaniment. Sometimes, silence can be just as effective in generating the proper emotions. Granted, the music is not all terrible, it's just excessive - but the cliched chanting has got to go.3) While I can forgive Merry and Pippin's all-too-fast integration into the Fellowship, The Council of Elrond scene, even with the additions (which help) still doesn't quite work. Oh well, at least we get to hear the actual \"ash nazg durbatuluk\" speach by Gandalf. And, there's a funny hidden parody of the scene on one of the DVDs.4) Saruman is still the cartoonish villain, with no extra depth.The Extra materials on the DVD are top-notch, and as you may have heard, go into minute detail regarding all the aspects of production. They will take hours of viewing, if you care enough to investigate. Some of the audio commentaries are interesting as well - it looks like the presence of Philippa Boyens who was a harder Tolkienite than the action-oriented Jackson, helped steer certain scenes into the right direction. And without Richard Taylor, Alan Lee and John Howe, the visuals (best thing about the film in the first place) would not have been possible. We also get some discussion about New Zealand (interactive map provided) and the filming locations.In summary : if you even remotely liked the film you saw a year ago, were hoping for an improvement, and did not make the mistake of purchasing the theatrical DVD in August - by all means get this one!\nquestion: Is the direction of the movie fantastic ?",

The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were! I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.Chicago Is a film that Is another hit at the big musical genre that is now coming back.

            "input": "review: I never knew I could love a superhero movie so much. What made this film great was its action, story, and great characters with came together to form a near-perfect film. Usually I don't understand superhero movies; I watched all three Spider-Man movies and I still don't understand, I didn't get the second X-Men movie, and I didn't like Fantastic 4. But The Dark Knight takes a different approach for all movie goers. It's easy to understand (Usually I need a superhero guru of knowledge to explain things to me), it didn't focus too much on relationships (Unlike Spider-Man), and it was more about action than talking.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) is considered a fugitive by Gotham City, and is wanted despite his heroism and getting scum off the street like the mob groups. He eventually forms an alliance with the police and the district attorney Harvey Dent, and even his former girlfriend Rachel, and together they remove several mob groups and hundreds of fugitives are arrested. All seems to be well for a small period of time until a person known only as The Joker shows up and starts killing people, all in return for Batman to reveal himself or more people get killed. Batman becomes the most despised person in Gotham over the fact that people's lives are being taken every day because of him, and there is nothing they can do about it. So Batman must hunt down The Joker and save his friends and the citizens of Gotham City, only this movie doesn't end how you'd predict it to.MUSIC: The music is fantastic and goes great with the already near-perfect film.DISTURBING FACTOR: I never expected a superhero movie to be this creepy and disturbing. There are some scenes which make this film borderline an R-rating for how violent some of them are. Heath Ledger really does a great job at portraying Joker as a complete psychopath who you'd be terrified to come across.ACTION: Lots of shooting, lots of hand-to-hand combat, lots of vehicular mayhem, lots of explosions, and even more! This is one of the best action films I've seen in quite some time.ENTERTAINMENT: This film has a lot of unexpected scenes, even things occurred that I would have never been able to predict. This film is a roller coaster ride of plot twists, adrenaline-rushing action scenes, and it's even suspenseful, all the way to the bizarre ending. This is without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite some time, and is a definite must-see for any movie buffs. You don't even need to be a fan of superheroes to enjoy this kickass movie, just go watch it... NOW!OVERALL: The beginning of the movie is slow with some relationship problems and a few other things, but when the ball starts rolling it doesn't stop and you don't want it to end any time soon.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, great action, surprisingly disturbing, little focus on relationship problems, and it's an overall kickass movie.THE BAD: The beginning is slow and goes into relationship problems, but it ends quickly at least.\nquestion: Is the scene of the movie great?",

Now, the only thing stopping me from a full 5 stars is the fact that the plot is simplistic and rehashed from similar movies. You know the type - bad guys (once good) were wronged by the good guys and now seeks ultimate revenge. Had the plot been more original, it would boost the score one notch. Then again, it's based on a comic book series so how deep can it really get? I feel no particular need to explain the story as it's been done thoroughly by other reviewers and I never like to divulge the story line or it spoils it for the rest.However, having said that, I was so impressed with the characterization, acting, and special effects.

It totally makes up for the lack of originality in the plot.Do yourself a favor, whether you are a die-hard comic book fan or a person who tends to dislike sci-fi or action movies, this flick will not disappoint!

            "input": "review: Having just seen Kill Bill, Vol. 2, I can confirm that the interviews and press reports are accurate:  By splitting one film into two, what you get are two halves that each has its own very pronounced merits, but need each other to survive.  In fact, I think if the two volumes had cross-pollinated a little more, you wouldn't have had just a good movie and a half, but two great films.But for now, Kill Bill Vol. 1.  It's the &quot;action&quot; half of the twins, and it dazzles right from the start with an audacious, extended extreme close-up on Uma Thurman's face.  The scene after, the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green, is classic Quentin Tarantino, heralding a return to his outrageous, dramatically intense roots.  Probably the strongest scene he's directed since the Mr. Pink-Mr. White altercation in Reservoir Dogs.  Unfortunately, after The Bride wakes up from her coma, the dramatic content flies down the meter, with a lot of posing and one-liners but very little in terms of character or emotional satisfaction.  Which means it's up to the endless action set pieces to grab our attention.  And they do.  However, I find them a little too bloody, even though I've spent the last 16 months digging through Shaw Brothers films (through the excellent Celestial Pictures VCD and DVD releases).  The endless bloodletting in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is shocking in the beginning, but after about five minutes in the extended climactic massacre, it's numbing.And for the record, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not a Shaw Brothers kind of film, despite the Shaw logo which opens the film.  You would have to wait until the &quot;training&quot; sequences in Vol. 2 to get Shaw Brothers-style cinema (which Tarantino appropriates very well there).  Vol. 1 is much more a paean to the Japanese style of filmmaking:  Extremely saturated colours courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson (even Shaw films didn't go this far in terms of garish colours -- we're in '80s Kurosawa territory here), emphasis on extreme wide shots, the very long builds, the brilliant music by The RZA.  And the martial-arts sequences are modern in their multi-angularity and speed cuts; Shaw Brothers action as epitomized by Chang Cheh's style focuses much more on choreography and mise en scene than multi-angularity, letting long medium shots capture the movement of the actors and fighters, relying very little on cuts.All in all, the most lacking element in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is still story and character.  Uma Thurman has some great moments (such as when The Bride first wakes up in the hospital), but after those blazing first 30 minutes, she will mostly become a statuesque hellfire angel who doesn't have a great deal of emotional advancement.  You will get that in spades in Vol. 2, which is hands down a superior story and film -- without the visual eye candy and endless action of Vol. 1, but with such powerful dramatic moments that it barely matters.  Again, I think if Tarantino had been able to meld the action and the drama a little more, rather than separate them into two movies that contain most of one and almost none of the other, he would have made both films greater than what they are.  As it stands, Vol. 2 will be what truly burns these characters and Tarantino's vision into your mind, while Vol. 1 is the adrenalized thrill ride with energy to spare, but without much in terms of thematic depth.\nquestion: Does the soundtrack perfect?",

This first movie based upon the second book in the series is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures like centaurs, satyrs, fauns, gryphons, dwarfs, a wicked albino witch, and four charming and innocent British school kids. The movie is entertaining, but it does not seem to resonate with any great significance or meaning despite Lewis's reputation as a Christian polemicist.The four siblings who have been evacuated from the London blitz during War II are staying with a rich man in his country mansion. The youngest, a girl, travels to the snowy land of Narnia by entering a magic wardrobe. She meets a faun and the wicked witch. The most important creature in Narnia is Aslan, the lion.The film is entertaining, well-cast and well-acted, has some great special effects as well as a few hokey ones, the voices of some famous stars, but there's no there there; it lacks the underpinning of a substantive reason for being.William Mosely who plays the older brother is every teenage girl's heartthrob.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide important insight not to mention more than a few tears.More relevant than ever, the movie does a great job as an eye-opener to one of the darkest events of the twentieth century.  The film provides the necessary background as well as an accurate description of conditions on the ground during the few months that the conflict lasted.  The world's reaction, or lack of it, (especially the American and British hypocrisy and inaction, and the French support of the Hutu perpetrators) is briefly touched upon.Moreover, it could have been and it should have been much more graphic in showing what really took place in Rwanda's \"killing fields.\"Hopefully more will be done to stop the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Western Sudan and we will not have to wait for another movie to come out after it's all over before people become aware and do that which is humane.Similarly to movies like The Lord of War, The Last King of Scotland, and Blood Diamond to name a few, Hotel Rwanda draws attention to some pretty important issues facing Africa.In short, Hotel Rwanda is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!\nquestion: Does at least one sure of the background of her new employee?",

You know what Im saying.  So the story is universal in that we can identify with the feelings of the protagonist, even if it is a monkey.Certain scenes are visually unforgettable.  Such as when Kong escapes the theatre and finally sees the Girl again in NYC, walking smokily down a blue lit street in pitch black winter.  You can see his expression go from fear it wont be her, to calm, and sad acceptance.  Throughout, Kong looks doomed and aware of it, even on the island.  He seems to be an older creature, and tired of the throne, which makes the protector relation to the girl more convincing.Really, a true classic.

The fictional story of the evil emporer Commodus and his betrayel of his top general is a interesting one.  In real life Rome had just had a number of great emporers : Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian and then Marcus Aurelius who was Commodus's father. All of these men had fought on the frontiers and made the empire strong , they were excellent emporers and then came the degenerate partier Commodus.  He fought in the gladitioral games and spent the empires money on his desires while the frontiers were being attacked.  He was cruel and finally killed and that was a good thing for the world.

It is fun and exciting and engaging, but I find it also to be slightly forgettable.  It is one of those films that leaves no complaints while in the midst of enjoying it, but it isn't one that you're going to remember three days later.Make sense?The film tells the true story of con-man Frank Abagnale Jr., who by the time he was 21 had made a living at deceiving and `stealing' from the government.  He was a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while never being any of those things.  He was, simply put, a genius.  Carl Hanratty was the FBI agent who was on his tail for years, never quite getting close enough to catch him (well, eventually), always one step behind.One thing to describe this film is `jovial'.  It is a happy fun film.  Within the restraints of the genre it works nicely.  It does lack the `human' element that could have really set this film apart (and made it more memorable).  While the film remains exciting and entertaining it lacks that gut punch that could have made this movie `mean something', and in the end it would have completed it.  That said, happy is what happy does, and happy does a lot for this film.  Not only is the plot rather boisterous, but the performances are all just so delightful.  Leonardo DiCaprio captures the suave and childlike adorableness of Frank Jr. rather remarkably.  A lot of my cinephile friends consider this one of his best performances.  I kind of agree, since it really capitalizes on everything that makes him such an endearing actor.  This is a far better performance than his confused turn in `Gangs of New York', which was released the same year.  Tom Hanks is perfectly matched here, for he really understands how to play up the genre here.  As many know, I am not a gigantic fan of Mr. Hanks, so for me to praise a performance takes a lot from me.  But, as anyone who knows me knows, I consider his lighthearted `non-baity' work to be his best (see `Big' and `That Thing You Do' for examples).  Christopher Walken may not be the most jovial character in the bunch (and he does insert the films only `human' element) but he nails his character.Also, look for Amy Adams in a scene stealing supporting role!All in all, `Catch Me If You Can' delivers a very strong and very likable experience.  It's a film that may not `stick with you', but it is a film you will have no quarrels with watching again and again.\nquestion: Is that movie good?",

However, the viewers might be divided in their opinions on how good the movie may be. For those who have not read the book, this movie will be their version of the One Ring that Rule them all. For those who have read the book, they may find it slightly disappointed at the choices Peter Jackson (director) made in the story. Now I have read the book I was slightly disappointed by some of the things Jackson did in the movie. (Did Gandalf forgot that he was a wizard?) All the stirring parts of the book was totally ignored but he did make other parts quite exciting and entertaining so I guess it even out. I can lived happily with Jackson's version outside of one part. I thought his treatment of Frodo and Sam was pretty shameful in the end. Here was two hobbits who basically saved Middle Earth from ultimate evil and there was little or almost no real acknowledgement from the Aragon or people of Gondor. Yes, they did all bend their knees to them in one scene but they also honor Pippin and Merry as well, equalizing Pippin and Merry with Frodo and Sam must be considered as an ultimate insult to the latter two hobbits. Jackson should had Frodo carrying the crown of Gondor to Aragon instead of Gimili and  he and Sam should had the higher honor then any other, since their was the most important of all the quests. Aragorn became King only due to Gandalf and Frodo/Sam's effort, they should be honored above all else. Only other major weakness as a film goes, it had to do with the end. Peter Jackson apparently lost his magic as he simply couldn't figured out how to end the movie. The ending dragged on and on and on like some endless poem that should have ended several verses ago.

This movie is senseless.In a nutshell, the hero does various dirty dance routines (presumably - because we never actually see the dances) in order to distract people so that her friends can steal a series of items in order to escape some sort of mental institution that doubles as a brothel.  Got all that?Why don't we see the dances you ask?  Because whenever a dance starts our hero goes into a fantasy trance and we are transported into a dream sequence where her and her fellow dancers take on zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, etc.  For example, one of the items that they need to steal is a lighter.  Therefore, the fantasy sequence involves the squad of women cutting the throat of a baby dragon, ripping out two fire crystals, and then a chase sequence with the mother dragon.I'll admit that the fantasy parts are pretty well done.  However, after the first two I found myself asking - \"Is this all there is?  Do I have to go through this two or three more times?\"  In that sense, I suppose Sucker Punch is a lot like a vasectomy.  The first one is a bit of a surprise, but the second one usually hurts a little more.  Party because you know what to expect... partly because... well... it's a vasectomy.  Sucker Punch was just like that.  The first cut scene was a bit of a surprise, but then you get through it and have to endure the second one.  Unfortunately, there are more than two in this case and no warm towel to soften you up!  This movie made me want to spend two days sitting on an ice pack.In the end, I just wondered what the point was.  This movie was just barely good enough so that I didn't turn it off.  That's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one.  One star is reserved for absolute trash like GI Joe.You know how you can really tell how bad this movie is?  By how much many of the 5 star reviewers spend their time defending it.  Uhhhh... If it was five stars, it would speak for itself, right?  Apparently not, because many 5 star reviews spend time advising everyone how they \"don't get it\" etc, etc.  Yes, yes, yes... the critics were wrong, the poor reviewers are wrong... blah, blah, blah.  You, my 5 star friend, are the only genius to see the magnificence of this film and the rest of us are just inbred and toothless dolts.Now give me a Bud and let me go sit in my recliner.\nquestion: What is your favorite music genre?",

Possibly the best I have ever seen in quite a while.The movie is pure originality and filled with grade A dialouge that only Tarantino can give.  The movie in all ways totaly lived up to my expectations and I still cant stop thinking about this masterpiece.  I think kb vol 2 stand on its own compared to vol 1.  The ending was quite suprising.  Not what I expected.  I love it!  The ending was beautiful and filled with tensions between the bride(...)The movie is more on the love side than blood dringing battles that took place in vol 1.Vol1 had more action and less dialoug but when you watch vol 2 you will be like \"What vol 1?\".  This film is so(...) good I might see it again.Bride is back for her final cut as she has to kill her way until that last person is BILL.  She will encounter new enemies such as bud(Bills brother)who was once an assasin for the DivAs.  But now is a drunk who lives in a trailer.  The movie is also longer than vol 1.  Thats really a good thing..  The movie is filled with action that you wont be able to blink one eye....Ok yeah you can..  You also take a stroll around the park as you see how The Bride(...) Learned her techneek.  From her master who is very dissaplint at what he teaches, the bride will stop at nothing to get what she came to do.  The movies dialouge is the most important one of all.  So pure.  So good only Tarantino can give us this!  I won't spoil anything for you but I can assure you this.  Kill Bill volume 2 is a masterpiece.  It is very underated and for those who think its over rated get your hw and come back when you realize what you've been missing out on.  Original, Pure, The best.  I choose this as my 2004 film of the year!Final note......DO NOT!  I REPEAT!  DO NOT GET Vol 1 or vol 2 on dvd.  If alot of people know how Tarantino is you know one damn thing....There will always be some Collecters edition crap with lots of added footage and great behind the scene footage.  What I'm trying to say is there will probably be some 3 disc  collecters edition with the unrated/Directors cut filled with all the color and gore you can feed on.  And it will probably have some great footage.  Though I dont think vol 2 didn't have any violent things taken out since it's main purpose wasn't violence in vol 2.  Even though there is 200$ special edition box set in japan just wait for some collecters edition to hit US probably around the end of 2004 or sometime in 2005.  Just wait.But for now go and see Kill Bill volume 2.Its worth every pennie....Ok not really but Its a masterpiece of all content needed.  Check it out.\nquestion: Do you have any positive views about the movie?",

            "input": "review: Unlike many of the currently posted reviews, I'm going to be reviewing the actual release, rather than speculating or complaining about the cover EDIT-Amazon now lists the proper cover shot as to what was used on the release).I received my Blu Ray of Destroy All Monsters today and promptly dropped it into the Blu Ray player.I commend Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock for releasing this one.From a story perspective, all the giant monsters are collected on a single island (Monster Island) for research purposes. Contact is lost with the control facility and what is discovered is that a race of aliens has taken control of the giant monsters. The giant monsters are sent to many different cities across the world and the human race must then wrestle control of the giant monsters back from the aliens. Fun stuff!Video:I'm torn here. I really, really wanted to love this release. What is there is 1080p HD in name, but the detail quality seems kind of low. I don't know what happened, but the colors seem washed out and faded while there are some instances of dust and dirt to be seen. Interestingly enough, you can still see the control cables and wires used for various special effects, so perhaps this was the best that could be done with it? I've read (and a commenter stated the possibility) that the source was a 35mm print.In my mind, the Blu Ray doesn't look to be much better than an upscaled DVD. I don't have the Media Blasters DVD to compare directly, so I don't know if it really is an upscale or not, but every indication points to this being a true HD source.Disappointing from an HD perspective certainly. If this is the same quality that was released in Japan (can't verify myself, sorry), then that tells me it is a source issue, but I don't know because I can't compare.Forums I've been to indicate this is the same master used on the Japanese release, but take that for what it is worth without validation.Audio:5.1 Japanese, along with 2.0 Japanese and English 2.0 (2 audio streams for English). I watched in Japanese 5.1 and the music and effects seem to be well separated in the front speakers, while the rear channels barely got much use. Since this was original recorded in 2.0 stereo anyway, I flipped over and I have to say the stereo separation is just about as good in my mind as the 5.1 in Japanese.I spot checked the English audio tracks and they seem to be on par in terms of audio quality as the Japanese. In terms of the quality of the English dub, I leave that to others to decide. Seems OK to me, but I expect hokey English on my giant monster movies anyway!Based on a comment on my review, I went back to check the English dub. I can confirm, without question, that BOTH the AIP AND the \"International\" Toho dub are, in fact, on this disc. Both English tracks are, however, in 2.0 Stereo ONLY. There is no 5.1 English dub. Not that most people who wanted the AIP dub would care that much, considering the film was in 2.0 stereo originally anyway.Packaging:For those of you in love with the image Amazon has up, be prepared to be disappointed. Or not, if you hated it. From the time it was displayed here to time of release, the cover has been changed. If you check out the Destroy All Monsters wikipedia entry, this release uses the poster artwork displayed there. It looks good to me.Otherwise the packaging is pretty bare bones. No inserts in the case or anything. Serviceable, but at $30 MSRP I'd have hoped for something a little better.Extras:Commentary is pretty good. Very nice to have it included.All of the trailers are in standard definition, which is OK I suppose.All of the Extras content is 480i and NOT 1080p.You get original trailers (English, Japanese, French (poor audio quality), RADIO spots for the AIP dub (English only with still images from the film) ), a storyboard image gallery, an 8mm reel from AIP (quality is poor, but it's still really cool to see this!) and image gallery.In my original Amazon review I ended up passing over a lot of the extras, so for that, I am terribly sorry.The extras on this disc are pretty fantastic in my mind. Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock put a lot of love into pulling together all of this material.Final Verdict:Destroy All Monsters is one of the best Godzilla movies around. It deserves to be owned, certainly. The Blu Ray release is probably the prettiest release the movie has seen, though that's not saying much with some of the previous releases.I've given it 4 stars because of the sloppy video (possibly not Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock's fault, I don't know). What is outstanding is the audio. Video drops the review by a star.If you don't already own it and enjoy the film, this is definitely worth picking up. If you are OK with the video quality on prior release and don't care about the AIP dub, keep your money.If you want the AIP English dub, this is THE release to get.Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock did an outstanding job on this release. Pulling together the trailers, the radio spots and even the commentary shows me that they actually appreciate the release as much as many fans. The video quality is the only mar on an outstanding release and it is something I can look past, as I've since learned that the video is from Toho's own remastered (in 2008) video.If you are a Godzilla fan, this is definitely worth the purchase price without question.\nquestion: Is the video good?",

The moral choices along with Batmans personal struggles all draw you in.  The tone of the movie is dark and it hardly ever comes out of that even in the end but there is a little light.  I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger or his movies but I have to say I think now I am gonna miss him.  I really had no idea of how talented he really was until I got to the end of the movie and said \"Wow\".  Though he is not even recognizable I found the Joker to be one of the best played out characters of all time. I did notice that at certain moments though intentional or not when Batman was not Bruce Wayne he talked in this weird throaty voice which I guess might of been intentional but sounded weird.  The movie left me a lot of room to really think about Batmans struggle and the way he handles himself in those situations to either be a hero or slowly turn to being a villain.  The choices and decisions that are before Batman presented by the Joker are just so well played and so well thought out the eventual solutions Batman takes and the results all play nicely together.  I did like the fact this movie did not have a whole bunch of CG and everything revolved more around the human element and the reasoning of human nature.  Don't get me wrong CG is not bad but this movie had a lot more going for it than pretty effects.  I do wish Two Face had a bigger role and I figured when I heard certain phrases close to the beginning of the movie I figured they would repeat later as some sort of lesson or something.  I found the ending to be relatively weak and kinda came to a quick end after yet another moral choice brought by Two Face.

Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, a man who has been in jail for  three years for murdering two black men. Upon his return to his family's  new apartment, the viewers learn of Derek's past involvement with the  largely-populated white supremacist gang in California. It is also made  clear that he wishes to escape his past life, to break free from the gang  that considers him to be &quot;a god.&quot; As he begins meeting his old  friends again, he discovers that his younger brother has become involved in  the gang, and throughout the movie, black-and-white flashbacks are used as  Derek's thoughts and stories used in order to convince his brother to leave  the gang before he gets himself in too deep. The film is totally violent  and utterly graphic, leaving none of the brutal aspects of the gang's  nature to the imagination. Norton and Edward Furlong, who plays the  brother, give excellent performances that add nothing but integrity and  believability to the film.

Unmistakably good, at that. Whereas the last couple of Pixar movies have descended to fairly typical Disney fare, Frozen rises towards the kind of film we haven't seen from Pixar since Toy Story 3 (a movie that made me cry, and I don't cry at movies very often). It's not as good as TS3, but it's definitely the best Disney Animation movie in a good long while.In an effort to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels. Olaf steals every scene he's in, and my kids loved him. Seriously, my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him, and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his &#34;puddle&#34; song as they can remember. My daughter, who is less interested in movies than the boys, would have turned right around and seen it again.The animation in the movie was, in a word, incredible, especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge. The songs are good (and who knew Kristen Bell could sing? Okay, so, well, maybe lots of people, but I didn't know, so I was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs), and, as I've already implied, the song by Olaf was really catchy.The best parts of the movie, however, can't be talked about without being spoilery: You've been warned.The death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for Disney. I'm not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type, but it's almost always the case. Possibly, for Frozen, it's there to help you feel as if you're in a typical Disney film (I kind of doubt it), but, whatever the reason, you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that they're not coming back. Of course, that's what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie. Elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it.One of the best moments is between Anna and Kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone (Hans) that she had just met that day. It's very amusing, because the immediate True Love thing is so endemic in Disney movies, so it's refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie. In fact, the catalyst of the whole thing is Elsa (now the Queen) refusing to allow the marriage between Anna and Hans because they had only just met. There's even a comment from Kristoff to Anna where he is saying &#34;no&#34; to her about something (no, I don't remember exactly what) because he doesn't trust her judgement. All of this is a nice break from that Disney cliche.And then there's the whole thing with True Love's Kiss that they also turn on its head, and that was great to see, too. And I won't say more than that, because I don't want to give everything away. Let's just say that the movie ended with both Anna and Elsa growing as characters, something that Brave, unfortunately, lacked.At any rate, it's a very enjoyable movie and one that I hope is signaling a new direction for Disney. Disney Princesses are great and all that, but it's good to have some that don't need to get rescued.Also, Alan Tudyk was great. I didn't even realize that was him until I saw his name in the credits. He's a great voice actor and under-appreciated as an actor in general.\nquestion: Is that film good?",

However, all my friends think it is the one of the best comedies ever made. This is much like Easy Rider.

For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better).

I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.In short, I liked the film.  Not a movie I plan on watching repeatedly, but it was worth the time to see.

            "input": "review: Somerset Maugham liked to characterize himself as a good writer of the second rank.  Much the same can be said of Truman Capote, with the caveat that he wrote one book of the first rank, his astonishing nonfiction novel IN COLD BLOOD.  This marvelous film tells the story of the writing of that book and reiterates the theory of one of Capote's most prominent biographers that the writing of that book was not merely the culmination of his career, but the cause of his decline as a writer and his descent into alcoholism.  The past few years has seen an explosion of biopics, but by any standard this has to stand as one of the very finest, and perhaps even the best.Whatever other merits this film has-and it has many-first and foremost is the incarnation of Truman Capote in the performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Almost every year going into Oscar season we see at least one performance that so completely overwhelms all of the others it seems inconceivable that that performance will not win the Oscar.  Last year that performance was Imelda Staunton in VERA DRAKE.  This year that performance is Hoffman in CAPOTE.  No performance in 2005 by either a male or female came anywhere near the job that Hoffman did here.  What is astonishing is not merely that Hoffman did such a magnificent job of imitating Capote's voice and mannerisms that he seems to be channeling rather than impersonating him but that within that imitation he delivered a performance of enormous subtlety and emotional range.  In other words, this performance truly is more about acting than about imitation, though the imitation is impeccable, despite the fact that Hoffman is far too tall for the role (but, then, Peter O'Toole was about a foot too tall to play the diminutive T. E. Lawrence in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA).  Hoffman's performance is so dominating and so remarkable that it alone would have been sufficient to guarantee the film's success, but luckily he is far from the only good thing in the film.This film, which has been widely reported as having been shot in slightly more than a month, is remarkable on almost every level.  The period look is impeccable from the dress to the d&eacute;cor of rooms.  Every aspect of the production is first rate, but what really shines is the superb cast, which is populated with a host of great character actors.  Apart from Hoffman no one performer stands out, but that is more a testimony to the overall excellence of the cast than the failure of any actor.  Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener (a great beauty who glams down in this one as Capote's close friend Harper Lee-the odd kid in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was modeled on Lee's childhood friend Truman--showing that she is going in middle age going to be one of our most versatile actresses), Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy), Bob Balaban, and Mark Pellegrino all perform marvelously in a very strong cast.  Clifton Collins Jr., an actor I previously knew only from several appearances on the television show ALIAS, was very good in the key role of Perry Smith, one of the two murderers with whom Capote somewhat identified and who he both befriended and exploited in writing his book.The story, of course, revolves around Capote's investigation of the horrific murder of a well liked and important family in a small town in Kansas.  Each of the victims had been bound and shot in the head with a shot gun.  After a police hunt two young men, Perry Smith and Richard Hickcock, were arrested for the crime.  They were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death.  During the proceedings Capote, who was covering the murders for the New Yorker, befriended Smith, who has a background similar to Capote's own.  The film is superb at showing the complexity of human motivation, how Capote both truly likes Smith and yet exploits him shamelessly while also being repulsed by him.  The cold-blooded manner in which Capote both exhibits tremendous compassion for Smith and lies to him about the state of his book is almost as scary as the murder that Smith commits in flashback.  Smith repeatedly asks Capote about how much he has written and what the title of the book will be and is told that he has made little progress on his untitled work.  In fact, Capote has nearly finished the book, largely waiting to find out whether Smith and Hickcock will succeed on their appeals of their death sentence, and very early on settled on the title.  A mark of how good the movie is comes when how tortured Capote is shown to be by his exploitation of Smith.  At the end his guilt drives him to agree to witness Smith's hanging.  The story from beginning to end is both riveting and horrifying.  I kept thinking of how the title of Capote's great book could be applied to almost every aspect of the entire story.I would highly recommend anyone who has seen this film but has not yet read IN COLD BLOOD to do so as soon as possible.  This truly is one of the most marvelously written books in the past half century.  The prose is as exquisite as any written in English during that period, with the nightmarish, harrowing murders portrayed as coldly and dispassionately as they were committed.  Throughout Capote distances himself from his subject matter and although to any attentive reader it becomes obvious that he has inside knowledge of many of the events in the book, he does not appear in any guise whatsoever.  If one knows nothing about Capote's involvement with Smith and Hickcock, as I did when I first read the book, it is clear that at the very least he conducted extensive interviews with everyone associated with the case.  Knowing how deeply involved Capote actually was makes his utter absence in the book especially eery.  IN COLD BLOOD is one of the finest American books of the past century and this fine film will hopefully be watched in conjunction with it in the future.  I will close by adding that while IN COLD BLOOD was made into a superb film (starring Robert Blake as Perry Smith), I think CAPOTE is an even better film.  I cannot recommend either the book or the movie more highly.\nquestion: Was the story and performance good?",

The story of Ralph and Vanellope is sweet, reflecting the film's theme of friendship and self-discovery, but not too sweet, with credible character interactions.The old-fashioned games at arcade would make some adult viewers feel nostalgic, but the film does not rely on the idea to entertain us.

Night Shyamalan's crap-fest, &quot;The Village&quot;An abortion of a film, &quot;The Village&quot; is the ripoff movie of 2004 with &quot;Van Helsing&quot; right next to it. These 2 films are playing in every multiplex in hell along with &quot;Signs&quot;, & &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, with a complimentary helping of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; thrown in for good measure (now THAT'S scary!). &quot;The Village&quot; is a scary movie that is made for women (its the type of scary movie that won't induce nightmares. In other words, its NOT scary) & looks like it was filmed on location at the local &quot;Pottery Barn&quot;.&quot;Covington Woods&quot; is home to a small village of peaceful people who have a small problem. They can't leave their village due to &quot;creatures&quot; living in the woods that surround the boundaries beyond the village. When the villagers first settled down into their new home, they made a pact with the &quot;creatures&quot; along the lines of, you leave us alone, we will leave you alone. &quot;The creatures&quot; have other ideas sneaking into the village at night leaving behind dead, mangled, & hairless chihuahuas about the grounds & scaring the villagers witless. When a stabbing occurs, that could prove fatal if not without the proper medication, a young blind girl, who isn't afraid of &quot;the creatures&quot;, is sent to the village across the way to get the proper medication that can heal her future husband.As I watched &quot;The Village&quot;, with roughly 30 other people in the theater, I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The only comedy relief that came throughout the film was when one of my fellow moviegoers promptly stood up during a slow point in the film, declared that this movie, quote - unquote, blows, and then left the theater. What suprised me was that not one of the 29 other people, myself included, didn't disagree with him!The movie is a bit of a bore. I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it. The cast is lame. Everyone walks thru their roles. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in her role (I was waiting for her to cowboy up, slap her idiot son in the back of the head, and go kill &quot;the creatures&quot; herself). William Hurt reads his lines as if their on cue cards. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's on some bad valium trip (his character is reminiscent of the Mel Gibson character from &quot;Signs&quot;. Phoenix even looks like a bit like Gibson in some shots).&quot;The creature&quot; is absolutely laughable, being a cross between a pig, & a porcupine with a red riding hood complex (Frank, the bunny from &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, is more scarier, for God's Sake!). I would be more scared if a car full of clowns showed up in the middle of the woods, than this &quot;creature&quot; chasing me.The so called &quot;gotcha&quot; surprise that happens in every one of Shyamalan's films usually suck. This one is no surprise (when the surprise is revealed, I couldn't help but think if these people missed watching the Democratic Convention and hugging a tree everyday. Maybe they still hug trees, but their was no hugging of trees on screen).Shyamalan's main downfall is that he always has the sense & style to create a suspenseful film but when it comes to the payoff, or the moneyshot he can never deliver (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the golden exception). Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; & with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.&quot;Time&quot; magazine was once quoted as saying that M.

The production design by Donald Graham Burt (who also did the upcoming \"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\") is excellent. The art direction by Keith P. Cunningham is excellent. The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo (who also did the upcoming \"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\") is excellent. The costume design by Casey Storm is excellent. This is Fincher's best film since \"Seven\", and yes, it is overlong, but it is interesting and it makes you think and keeps you intrigued.\nquestion: Does the costume design seem excellent?",

            "input": "review: This movie has a lot going for it, Superb animation, memorable songs, the characters on the whole are very likable, though a couple of improvements could have been made. Starting with Anastasia herself. Who seemed a bit too  self centered for my tastes. Which is pretty common with female characters  in most animated films, but she in particular seems to be driven ONLY by  her own needs. Wanting to know about her past and finding her family is  fine, but it would have been nice if she had be shown to express concern  for, or helping out someone else during the course of the movie.  To this  day I still think the most enduring female character in an animated movie  has to be Mrs. Frisby from The Secret of Nimh. A character motivated not by  finding Prince Charming, but who's strife and hidden courage comes from  trying to save the life of her child. A character you truly feel for. I  really wish more characters could be written like that.It would have  also been better to see more of why Rasputin hated the Romanovs so much,  which BTW makes you wonder, if he was out to obliterate the Romanovs  completely why didn't he go after the Grandmother, wasn't she one too?I  do believe Anastasia is a really good film, if not perfect, and I recommend  seeing it. And after you do, check out The Secret of Nimh, which I think is  Don Bluth's BEST animated film!\nquestion: Why her character is really enjoyable?",

            "input": "review: Firefly is like no other television program.  Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair.  How could it go wrong?  A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets.  Why did it only last one season?  Marketing.  FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the \"fair and balanced\" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness.  For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago.  Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap?  Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting \"reality\" television?  From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be \"yes\".  Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, \"why\".  Yet, in all of its power, it was cancelled.Firefly is perfection on a stick.  The twang of the guitar, the stone-face stare of Mal, the goofiness of Jayne (is that a girls name?), the questionable past of Shepard Book, the humor of Wash, the power of Zoe, and the innocence of Kaylee is exactly why I fell in love with this show.  This is honestly, one of the few series that I could go back from the beginning and watch again, loving every moment of it.  Whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes, and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive.While some will argue that Firefly was full of nothing more than C-rated actors who were \"shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom\", I thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming. I wanted to know the truth behind River and the darkness behind the good Shepard.  I continually waited for a snappy comeback from Mal, and was excited whenever he showed humility.  Jayne was a big favorite of mine, always questioning authority, yet as loyal as the family dog.  The love between Zoe and Wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci-fi series.  It wasn't just about paying for the ship, flying through unmapped terrain, or stealing, it was about humanity.  That sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled \"Serenity\".  In it, the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo.  Inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever.  For this series to work successfully, as it did, we needed human characters that bled, felt compassion, and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us.  Mal's ship, Serenity, was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally.The characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them.  Listening to the words that pass through Mal's mouth, the charm of Wash, or even the inconsistent ramblings of River, you could only wonder where Whedon could have gone with all of them.  In each of these characters, Whedon had written secrets.  While, sadly, we may never know what they all were, that is what made you itch for more episodes.  You not only wanted to see the creative \"western\" adventures that Whedon was sending his crew, but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades.  They were good, but possibly darkness reigned inside of them.  The character most guilty of this (outside of River) was Shepard Book.  I loved this character.  Whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction, yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable.  He is an excellent example of what this series was like.  He represented the smart words of Whedon, the humanity of his character, and the secrets that each of these shared.  He was a \"priest\", yet he knew more about the Alliance than anyone aboard that ship.  If anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words, I would simply say, \"Shepard Book\".George Lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future, or a galaxy far far away, Whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not-too-distant future of 500 years.  Prostitution in legal, in fact respected in the community, the Chinese and Americans have forged one super power called the Alliance, and our hero is a war veteran, still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the Alliance control.  While Lucas gives us far-fetched characters and situations, Whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future.  I think that is why this series worked so well for me.  I could imagine this future.  I could see it past the characters.  I wasn't bogged down by dopey looking aliens, but instead a plausible man vs. man situation.  Firefly was simple, yet so complex.I could honestly go on forever about how much I enjoyed this show.  I have never watched a series where I found myself prepared to watch over and over again. Firefly blends a power mixture of comedy, western, and action all together ... and the characters bleed.  Villains die in this series.  How often do you see that?  If you have not watched this series, or have not spent the money to support it, DO IT RIGHT NOW!Grade: (proudly) ***** out of *****\nquestion: Is this plot original?",

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A new star is discovered near our solar system, on a collision course, approaching fast - VERY FAST! Some amongst scientific community believe it can pass near Earth, close enough to burn all life on our planet - and those are the optimists... Then, a planet orbiting this new star is discovered... I will say no more about the story.This film is based on a popular SF novel written in 1933 and therefore is definitely NOT linked to any kind of Cold War scares, unlike what some critics wrote back in the 50s. Far from being a parabol of nuclear war, both the book and the film are in fact SF variations on the theme of Deluge and Noah's Ark...This review will be short, because I really don't want to give away too much - so let me just say, that this film indeed is aged and yes, the plot has many holes, but it still remains a nice watch and of course a pretty powerful story, with the ending being particularly good.Actors are mostly forgotten today, even if both Richard Derr and Barbara Rush had a long and rather succesfull career, mostly on TV - she also played the main female character in another SF classic from 50s, &#34;It came from Outer Space&#34; (1953). Veteran specialists of second roles, Larry Keating and John Hoyt are in fact even more important in this film than actors who are in principle cast in leading roles.A sequel was planned, to be based on the second part of the book, &#34;After Worlds Collide&#34;, but ultimately the project was abandoned. A remake of this film was considered also already for some time, but for the moment it seems also that all those plans were shelved. And it may be for the better, because this film, with all its weaknesses, still packs some punch and is still a darn good watch. Enjoy!\nquestion: Is it a good movie?",

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Bill Paxton.Titanic is a fictional love story about Rose (Winslet) and an `average joe' Jack (DiCaprio). Both meet on the infamous, unsinkable Titanc ship. Yeah, I just love these one-dimensional characters where the poor are the noble underdogs, and the rich are evil bastards.Ahh, we all know about Titanic, probably the most overrated movie ever. James Cameron is a fine action and sci-fi director. I repeat, ACTION AND SCI-FI. When it comes to love stories, especially tearjerkers, he has no skill. Why? The man can't write...at all...he just sucks at it. Lets face it, Terminator 2 was an awesome action movie, but the dialogue is cringe-worthy at times. And what about the end of T2? It tried to be deep and heart wrenching, but it failed and came off as stupid. Keep in mind, I love T2. I've seen it more than any other movie, and it still continues to entertain (it's actually one of my favorites). But I won't pretend that it doesn't have any flaws, because it does. So anyway, you get the point. Cameron is a limited director, and shouldn't do anything besides action and sci-fi. Case in point, the dialogue for Titanic is bad too (there's too many embarrassing quotes to list). If anything, Titanic can give you some minor entertainment from it's laughable script.Instead of focusing on the real tragedy at hand, we get an unnecessary, clich&eacute; love story. Furthermore, I personally think the premise is ridiculously disrespectful. Taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story. WOW! What's next? 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or better yet, The Crucifixion (yeah, I bet Jesus had a few ladies on the side. That dirty dog!)? Why is this wrong? Because they're basicially saying, \"Ok, lets focus on these two characters, and ignore the rest! As long as these two get out, it doesn't matter who else dies!\". Sure enough, I've seen this movie with different groups of people, and none of them cried (or even cared for that matter) when most of the passengers were killed, but once Leonardo froze to death, then here come the waterworks! I don't care if I spoiled the movie for those that haven't seen it (since you shouldn't watch it anyway). Yep, a pathetic tearjerker ending to make the easily amused women in the crowd cry. No wonder it won so many Oscars.The acting here is pathetic. Leonardo DiCaprio was still in his teenage heartthrob phase, and didn't have an excellent director like Martin Scorsese to make him look good. As a result, his emotions seem terribly forced and unbelievable. Billy Zane is basicially the same, only twice as bad. It's quite embarrassing to watch, really (he should stick to cool movies like Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight. That was a great horror movie, and his character was pretty funny).Overall, I give Titanic * (that may be overrating it, actually). This was an insult to the viewer's intelligence, and nothing more than a dull storyline to fill out a 3 hour long borefest. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No compelling storytelling, no brilliant acting, and no interesting dialogue. Nope, it's almost worthless in every way. Yeah, the boat looked good, but they had $200 million to work with, so you knew it would. I'm sure most of you have already had the displeasure of seeing this, but for those that haven't, NEVER WATCH THIS.\nquestion: Was the dialogue nice?",

This is the unofficial sequel to Romero's \"Dawn Of The Dead\" (the 1978 version of course) made primary for Italian audiences when Dawn was released there under the title of \"Zombi\". Even though this one doesn't take place in a mall or feature anything or anyone like the original storyline of Dawn, it does have almost the same feel. Eventually in America, this film came to us with English dubbed audio under the title of \"Zombie\". But now Shriek Show has finally released a remastered 2 disc set of this classic movie fully uncut for the first time in the states.Or so I thought.Ya see, when the movie starts, there's a brief scene set-up (as it always was), then it goes into the opening credits. I was expecting to see the original Italian credits showing it finally under it's original title \"Zombi 2\", like the box. But it isn't, it's the American version with the title \"Zombie\". Nitpicking, huh? But after a little searching I found an Easter Egg that shows that original title sequence that finally shows that this film was called \"Zombi 2\". Here's how to get to it (it's easy....):On Disc One go to the \"Features\" section. In there, press the number \"6\" on your remote. It will activate a red skull button in the upper right on the screen (you CAN'T activate it by searching around the menu with your arrow buttons, very rare by Easter Egg standards!), and it will press the button automatically and take you to the original Italian opening credits and clearly show that this film was called \"Zombi 2\", logo and all. Also, after they're done, it will show an alternate end credits, but honestly I couldn't see any difference on them as opposed to the ones on the movie now.All in all, this movie has never looked or sounded better ever. Some say it's looks too cleaned up now. They might have a point because the picture is so perfect now (colors bright, sharp image, brightness exact, sound crisp, etc) that it gives away the effects in the movie. Well, I'd rather have this movie perfect picture than a dark, grainy VHS anyday.This movie is a classic piece of horror history and should be owned (especially the Shriek Show 25th Anniversary version...the extras here are superior....the making of documentary is as long as the movie itself!) by anyone with two or more \"Living Dead/Zombie\" DVD's already in their collection. I'm glad I got it, THIS is the way classic horror should be re-released.P.S.: If you look hard enough (the DVD's trailer section has their previews), there is a \"Zombi 3\" and a \"Zombie 4\" movies out there too. Trust me, you don't need them or want them, as they don't have the same feel or quality of \"Zombi 2\" or \"Dawn Of The Dead\". Just be happy with their trailers.

Why are so many concert videos and dvd being filmed that way nowadays?! Look at Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio. That's a great band with a great performance, but the video editing is pure crap! I can't even watch that one. Rush In Rio isn't quite as bad as the Iron Maiden one, though. The camera shots jump around too fast mostly in the first half. Especially during the first 2 or 3 songs. Then it becomes a little less annoying in the 2nd half. Lately I've been starting with One Little Victory and watching it from there just because the camera work is too annoying during much of the first half.I think they should recall this dvd, then let ME come in and do the video editing and I'd make the video portion of the dvd perfect. And I'd do it for free!The sound has some minor flaws, but it's hard to tell on my tv because I don't have it hooked up to my stereo, so I can't give an accurate stereo quality review.There's a lot of energy from the audience which may annoy some people.

To find out more about the film and why it is such a great adventure and a classic series I suggest viewing this set.I carry very fond memories of this series and I have enjoyed all the adventures of Indiana Jones. The box comes with 4 disc. The picture is sharp and the sound is in THX for those who have a certified system. The menus are nice here too and feature changing picture clips and music from the film.  One of the drawbacks of this set for me however was the absence of a director commentary on each disc and there are no German subtitles nor German language options. Those of you who have seen this series know that two of the three films featured the use of sparse German dialog and it would be nice to read what was said. The extra features have been saved to the fourth disc which includes a making of and other behind the scenes you would come to expect. I would however liked to have seen more from Lucas and Spielberg about their films and get some answers on what we can expect to see in the next film.

And glad I did tho I received just the single disc and I see that the Blu Ray and  Digital version are offered at the same price.I watched the extended version which has many excellent scenes that were deleted.  Most of them were great and shouldn't have been removed from the theatrical version whose beginning 45 minutes just dragged on and on. This extended version really improves things for me.  The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.  There was only one scene towards the end, which contained an army officer in a truck of solders( don't want to spoil it so I am not saying what happens in this scene) that I thought could have been left out; seemed really cheesy to me.I'm not into book reports so here's my take on the transfer quality only.  Get it.  The video is quite outstanding...beautiful color saturation and shading, wonderful depth throughout.  No grain, no artifacts, nothing to take away from  the demo transfer quality that this is.The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and, in many parts, is also demo worthy.  There really is an expansive sound stage and perfect directionality from the discreet speakers when appropriate.Unless you don't like the movie itself, there is no reason not to have this King Kong on blu ray.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks\nquestion: What's the greatest scene?",

She is loved by struggling writer Paul Varjak; he not only falls in love with her, but he loves her and becomes strongly concerned about her, so much so that he breaks off his indiscreet affair with a married lady, an interior decorator who, in one sense, uses him. (The versatile Patricia Neal plays the part of the interior designer perfectly.)This is quite a successful directing feat for Blake Edwards, and Henry Mancini provides a beautiful music score for this classic movie.Audrey Hepburn portrays so well the beautiful, mixed-up Holly Golightly, originally a girl who has run away from a marriage with a doctor from Tulip, Texas;Buddy Ebsen does a good turn in this minor role as the doctor.

            "input": "review: Princesses Elsa and Anna are sisters and best friends until Elsa's power over ice and snow gets away from her and she hurts Anna. Elsa completely pulls away, locking herself away from the world and working to control her powers by suppressing her emotions. Their parents downsize the staff and close the gates to Arendelle to reduce the danger Elsa poses to others. Anna feels abandoned and both girls feel utterly alone. Years later, their parents die in a boating accident, making Elsa the queen of Arendelle. She is forced to open the gates and hold a coronation celebration. The coronation goes well, but her powers are revealed after a heated argument with Anna. She runs away, leaving a wake of ice and snow, making the much needed summer into winter in Arendelle. Anna feels it's her responsibility to make amends with Elsa and convince her to life the supernatural winter.Frozen is a fun film with charming characters and an unexpected ending. Anna and Elsa are both sympathetic characters who feel alienated and alone. I just want to give Elsa a great big hug. She tries her best to contain her powers and her feelings, sacrificing her close relationship with her sister in order to shield her from harm. She is forced to hide a fundamental part of herself in order to appear normal and utterly fails, causing harm to her entire community. I&#34;m glad she wasn't a real villain as in the original story (which is very weird and religious), but a person trying her best and making mistakes. Anna is funny, quirky, and definitely not the poised and graceful Disney princess one might expect. She's very clumsy and embarrassingly blurts out her feelings to random people. She just wants a real relationship with her sister, to be able to make friends, and to have people around instead of cutting themselves off. My favorite character is Olaf, the living snowman who loves warm hugs. He provides perfect comic relief and he's just adorable.Disney films are rather guilty of having two people fall in love rather quickly based on next to nothing and then living happily ever after. It seems as if this film goes in that direction when Anna falls for Prince Hans of the Southern Isles and accepts a proposal within an evening of meeting. When Anna is once again injured by Elsa's magic, her condition is said to be cured by an act of true love, suggesting Hans should save the day. The ending switches things around and Anna is cured because she threw herself in front of Elsa as Hans tried to kill her. The true love in this instance wasn't romantic love, but sisterly love. I really enjoyed this subverting of typical Disney tropes and the story is the best Disney has produced in a while.The music of the film is delightful and another reason for the film's success. The filmmakers opted to hire Broadway composers to create these fun songs of varied styles. Do You Want to Build a Snowman is a cute, but sad song that encompasses Anna and Elsa's relationship after the accident and each of their loneliness and frustration. For the First Time in Forever is a cute song that shows Anna silly and quirky nature and her excitement for human contact and a dash of Elsa's mantra to control her powers. Love is an Open Door is an adorable instalove song between Anna and Hans with more of a rock feel and fun harmonies. In Summer is Olaf's hilarious song about his obsession with summer, but he has no idea what snow does in heat. The song has a nice old Hollywood musical flair and some unexpected lyrics. The best song of the film is Let It Go, Elsa's song of empowerment where she accepts herself despite what others think of her. Idina Menzel belts out the song and gives it the power it needs. The visuals are also amazing as Elsa effortlessly builds an ice castle around herself.The only part of the film I didn't really like was the trolls. They were cute and provided some comedy, but didn't really add much to the story. They could have easily been cut out without anything essential being removed. Other than that, Frozen has my vote for best animated film of 2013.\nquestion: How good was the music?",

As Stanely Kubrick's last movie it shows what the director was capable of but is rather lacking at  the same time.Despite what many have said about the film, it isn't a  porno movie. Sorry.  It is a series of adventures into a intresting dream  world.  Every scene is very well shot and unique.  In fact it's fair to say  that the whole isn't the sum of it's parts.  While all the different  encounters Tom Cruis's character has are well-done and intresting, they  don't fell connected and the story falls apart quickly.  Also, the audience  never really gets a sense of Cruis's or Kidman's character.The film  also feels rather incomplete.  Many times it apears the story is heading  toward an interesting confrontation only to have the plot abandon the  situation and head in a completely different direction.

We watched it on a 55\" LG with passive 3D. The image was crisp and the 3D added, in my opinion, to the viewing experience over watching a standard Blu ray ... and I think that standard Blu rays normally look pretty good.I doubt I have to fill anyone in about the subject of this movie. It takes several Marvel super-heroes who have all had their own films leading up to this and puts them in one epic package. True to the Marvel taste, for most of the film they do not get along well with each other, but come together when it counts to fight an exhausting and dangerous battle against seemingly impossible odds. But what else are super-heroes supposed to do? LOLThe acting is convincing, and there are quite a few moments of humor to give you a break from the more serious tone of the movie (a defect in the otherwise brilliant movies in the new Batman series).The sound in this presentation is simply outstanding. I don't remember another film which has driven my subwoofer more powerfully or effectively. The rest of the sound comes through powerfully and crisply too.

I felt that Annette Benning's character, who felt threatened, in addition to justbeing an anal-retentive, controlling witch with a capital B, was very mean and cold towards Ruffalo's character.Julianne Moore's character was a bit of a messy, confused, psychological user.Moore's character is that kind of person who is filled with inner turmoil or frustration, but makes it everybodyelse's problem around her. I hated how she treated the latino gardener too, just because she felt guiltyabout all of the drama and calamity that she was causing in her affair with Ruffalo's character!I always say: \"Don't jump in the river, if you're not a strong swimmer, babe!\" (-:Ruffalo's character was the perfect outlet for her pent up sexual confusion / tension,and the two (again) enter into a very complicated and torrid affair, which of course, couldonly end in heartache for all concerned.  As soon as Moore's character quenches her sexual thirst/curiosity,she just basically returns back to her life relationship Benning's character and the \"kids\",after she and Ruffalo's character are found out, and they all seem to throw Ruffalo's character under the bus...As if to say, \"Okay babe, we've all uprooted you from your life, and now we're done with ya!--So ummmm---kay, bye!\"This kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, as Ruffalo's character is literally lefton the outside looking in, as Benning & Moore & the kids reunion-reconnection happens without him.He is locked out of their lives...Lives that he really never knew exsisted in the first place,until they invaded his, satiated their curiosity, and sent him packing.Not cool, I felt. )-:Not saying that Ruffalo's character was a saint or anything, but the man had his own businessand his own life...as unorthodox as it was...but then again, wasn't Benning, Moore and the kids' livesjust as unorthodox? I guess I just wished that a balance could've been reached between all parties,and it could've ended on that note, instead of Ruffalo's character, who btw, he played with a great spirit& optimism, being dejected and disregarded. Just my humble opinion of course.

It has wonderful cinematography and the performances are very good. But in my opinion, the movie does too little with a really fantastic premise, and I don't mean it should have been a \"disaster movie\". The first half of the movie is terribly slow, showing in hundred different ways how \"melancholic\" the character Justine is. Kirsten Dunst's Justine seemed rather schizophrenic than melancholic - considering how she acted during her wedding. It also made the character very unlikeable.The second part centers on her sister Claire, and the tempo improves (even though there is never any doubt how the movie will end). I liked the second part much more, as there is more interaction among the characters. Charlotte Gainsbrough as Claire is very believable and compelling. She was my favorite character in the movie.

            "input": "review: This place doesn't have to try too hard to be ultra hip or cool. The fact that the hotel doesn't even have to put a sign on the building or the door will tell you that. With that being said, a stay at the Clift can transport you to a hip and trendy city lifestyle, which is exactly what I wanted for a weekend getaway from suburbia. The rooms are clean, light, and tastefully decorated in a very modern style; very comfy sleigh bed with superior down and cotton bedding. I'm pretty picky about my sheets, and I was tempted to buy these to take home with me. The hotel has the bedding custom made for them and new sets are available for sale. A stay at the Clift can be pricey. This is a trendy five-star hotel after all. However, packages can be found with good discounts for people not wanting regular chain-like accomodations and adventurous to try something different. I opted for a deluxe room at the Clift and was glad I did. There were three large windows in my outside facing corner room allowing lots of light and pleasant city sounds to filter in. The Clift's location is not ideal for sweeping views; but this was acceptable with me when selecting the hotel. A nice touch to the decor of the room were the mirrors and floor to ceiling curtains adorning the walls. No need for artwork that way, just the pleasant mix of colors, fabrics, glass, and contemporary furniture. Is the decor what I might select for my home? Probably not, but the change of scenery sure was fun for a evening. The room had candles and matches ready to go and the warm indirect lighting helped make this a contemporary romantic getaway. The CD player had excellent sound and the DVD player was a nice touch. Some might find the tv a joke as it's only a 19&quot; model, but then again, I wasn't shelling out big bucks for watching tv. The location of the Clift is excellent for the theatre/shopping crowd and getting a cab is not too difficult. The front desk staff and the doormen were very friendly and helpful. The only thing keeping this stay from being an excellent experience was the breakfast at the Asia De Cuba restaurant. The decor and the food are nice, but they must have been understaffed the morning I decided to go, although the restaurant was not even 25% full. Breakfast was included with my special package rate, so this is where I was going to dine no matter what, but I expected decent, if not excellent and courteous service at such a fine restaurant. I could barely get a refill on my iced tea. The table next to mine was getting very impatient and almost downright rude about the slow service. All in all, I would steer clear of breakfast, unless it's included in your rate. Reviews for lunch and dinner seem to be better...so maybe someday I'll check it out, but with so many other choices in the city, the Asia De Cuba left a bad impression on me and it will be some time before I return to eat there. Some people leaving reviews have complained about noise, smelling smoke in the hallways, and having no dresser in the room, but I did not encounter any problem with these. I found the closet adequate for my luggage and unpacking of my necessary items so as to reduce wrinkling. As for noise, this is the CITY, not a country getaway, so I anticipated I'd hear some noise at some point in my stay, but honestly, I was never disrupted by noise in any way. I definitely rate the hotel very high in terms of a nice stay and felt I had a good value for my money.\nquestion: How good is the quality of the restaurants?",

Carlo gave me a room on the 5th floor in the back. It ended up being too noisy because it was right across from an elevator. I went down and tried for another room with another front desk clerk which I was given a room on the 2nd floor. I believe it was room 208. It was an inner room facing Myrtle Street. Very nice. I liked this room much better. Very roomy. Comfortable bed. Checked the sheets, very clean. Toiletries included a packet of shampoo and lotion and one small bar of soap. Ice machine was on the 3rd floor. Plastic cups. Double pane windows kept street traffic at bay. TV worked fine. Didn't try the internet. Mel's Diner on corner (street level). Deluxe Continental breakfast was mostly bread items and some fruit. Great weekend. Kept luggage with them after checkout. Hotel not far from California cable car line. Must buy a City Pass if seeing the sights. The 7-day MUNI pass in it was worth the price alone. Didn't know about any bed bug stories until I got back. Saw the reports. We had none.

            "input": "review: My boyfriend and I stayed for two days at the Mosser from 8/23 - 8/24. We had room 608, which had a queen bed with bathroom and closet. The room was neat and clean with stylish, modern decor, but it was extremely tiny, although I expected that from reading other people's reviews. Just be prepared for a 2-3 foot perimeter around the bed, and that's it. Not much of a view, but you're in the city center, so that was also expected. It was reasonably quiet, in any case. Nice TV with cable, CD player, a chair or two, trashcan, and a nighttable was all that was in the room. There is no A/C, so we kept the windows open, which was fine. San Francisco usually has pretty temperate/cool weather.The bathroom was also tiny; standard tub, toilet crammed in right next to it, and sink across from that. Decent water pressure, plenty of hot water. I didn't much care for the sink though. It is about the size of a urinal, and there is a shelf right above it, so you can't splash your face with water without hitting your head on the shelf. Also hard to spit when brushing your teeth. Overall, it wasn't too bad though; just annoying.The lobby looked really nice, and the staff were friendly and pleasant. Breakfast was minimal - just coffee and muffins in a basket in the lobby, but the muffins were pretty good. We went around the corner to Mel's Diner on Mission St to supplement our breakfast - great food, cheap. Annabelle's Bistro was right next to the hotel, so we stopped in there for drinks in the evening, and it seemed like a good, local hangout. The location was good in the center of downtown. It was one block to Market Street with tons of shopping, restaurants, big office buildings, just a few blocks from San Francisco Bay. You can get to/from the SFO airport easily using the BART subway system, which has a stop just around the corner from the hotel on Market St; it was a $6 ticket/25 minute ride straight there. We used the MUNI system of trolleys to get around otherwise, which was also just around the corner and cheap at $1.50 anywhere you want to go on the line. The F line was our friend and goes all the way out to Fisherman's Wharf in about 15-20 minutes with stops at the piers along the way. We paid cash (exact change required) to the driver each time, but you can also get a MUNI card, which might be a little cheaper, depending on how many rides you take. As far as fun things to do, we had a car for two days ($35/day to park at the Mosser) and traveled to the Napa/Sonoma area one afternoon and hit a few of the wineries for tastings. It took about an hour to get there, and most of them close by 5 pm, so don't get up too late. Beautiful scenery, nice wines, tons of vineyards to try. The next day we drove to Muir Woods, which is an ancient sequoia forest with a walking trail. That was amazing; I felt like a dinosaur would come lumbering out from amongst the giant trees at any moment. We also hit the five-course Cirque du Soleil-style dinner show, Teatro Zinzanni at Pier 27/29; great food, great show - not cheap, but we thought it was worth it; book ahead. My favorite sidetrip was a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. We rented bikes from Blazing Saddles at Fisherman's Wharf for around $45 each, and it was a simply astounding ride past Ghirardelli Square to Fort Point, over the bridge, and down to the cute, little village of Sausalito, where we took the ferry back across (ferry ticket included in price). Took about 2-3 hours total.  Okay, back to the hotel. We also stayed four nights at the Queen Anne in Pacific Heights about 1.5 miles away, and both of us liked the Queen Anne better to be honest. The price was about the same (~$150/night), but the Queen Anne seemed more authentic to San Francisco, extremely cool, relaxed neighborhood (Fillmore district) with lots of neat boutiques and no chains, the rooms were 5x bigger, they had a better, more expansive breakfast, better bathrooms, and very reasonable access to transportation. However, if you really want to be in the bustling city center, convenient access to everything is the most important factor for you, and you don't mind being in a more corporate-y area, then the Mosser is the place for you, and is very reasonably priced for its location, especially if you get the rooms with the shared bathroom in the hall.\nquestion: What is your favorite breakfast?",

You can take a train from the airport, to Powell Street station for $4.95 (then walk up 2 blocks to the hotel), saving a huge amount on cab fares! As the weather was so pleasant, we frequently walked all the way back to the hotel from Fishermans Wharf, taking in all of the sights along the way.When we first arrived, we were given a small room overlooking Geary Street, which proved to be extremely noisy (street performers, dust carts, sirens etc. etc.) So after a sleepless night we asked if we could move, which was no problem at all. The very helpfull staff at reception moved us to a much larger room overlooking the pool area, which we found to be excellent (considering what we paid and the fact that the hotel is only a 3*).In terms of eating, there are some fantastic 'diner' type places all within 5mins walk of the hotel or you can wander into China Town or even through to Little Italy where you will find some excellent restaurants.Overall, we loved San Francisco and thought that the hotel was very good, considering the price and location.

The front desk staff were helpful, the cleaning staff did an excellent job cleaning our room daily and the breakfast staff did a fine job of replenishing food during an always hectic breakfast. The breakfast was excellent with a number of different choices (both hot and cold food available). One of my daughters' suffers from asthma. Unfortunately we could not book and be guaranteed a non smoking room through Hotwire in advance. However I contacted the Hotel on the morning of our arrival to request a non smoking room and upon our arrival later that day they had met my request and our non smoking room was ready for us(before 3 p.m. check-in) Our only concern would be the room location given to us. The room faced Beach St. and the F Line Streetcar roars by on Beach St. starting around 5:00 a.m. The Hotel's sound insulation was good but we often were still awakened by the sound of the streetcar in the morning. However we most certainly thought we got excellent value! The location in Fisherman's Wharf was excellent with easy access to public transit (both Cable Cars and the streetcar line). We rented a car for 3 of our 7 day stay and were able to find overnight street parking near the hotel every night which allowed us to save about $40 per night had we parked the car in the Hotel garage. My wife and I are both runners and we used the Hotel's fitness facility. As well it was a short run from the Hotel to the waterfront where we could run along the Embarcadero for several miles without worrying about vehicular traffic.

Tuscan was wonderful! The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The rooms were also quiet and we felt safe. The location was great, just a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. One day we got a day pass and took the cable cars and buses to view other parts of the city such as Chinatown, Golden Gate Park, Painted Ladies houses. The bus line we needed was just across the street and the cable car was a block away. Again, the location was great! The 5-6 pm complimentary wine hour was a nice feature. They did have soda for younger people, but ran out so my dtr didn't get anything to drink. In the morning there is complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscotti. We arrived at the Oakland Airport and took BART to get to SanFrancisco and then the f-line muni to get to Fisherman's Wharf. It was ok, but it took a good hour to get to our motel. It cost about $8 per person to travel this way. We decided to take a shuttle back to the Oakland Airpost. There was a shuttle that advertised $23 for one person and $10 for additional people...so it cost $33 which was worth it. It only took about 20-25 minutes by shuttle to get back to the Oakland Airport. I'd definately stay at the Tuscan Inn again.

Located conveniently on Fourth St, the hotel within walking distance to BART and the #30 &amp; #45 city bus known as MUNI stops within several yards of the Mosser's front door. How convenient. I did not need my car for the entire 3 day/2 night stay. The #30 bus (Stockton) is down the street on Market and Third, and this will take you all the way to Chinatown. If you want to continue to Fisherman's Wharf, the Marina District and the Palace of Fine Arts / The Exploratorium, the #30 will take you there too.The entire staff at this hotel is professional, courteous and attentive. They answered my questions and provided information on restaurants and bus routes. My room had a queen bed and I chose the shared bath for the price. Next time I will upgrade for a few bucks more and get a room with a bath. Upon entering my room, the temperature was warm, but luckily there was a ceiling fan and a window to open for some breeze. The bed was comfortable and a small tv was located at the foot of the bed. My room was nicely decorated and modern looking. Closet was small, but adequate. In my room, the hotel provided a blowdryer, lotion, shampoo and a small bar of soap. The shared baths were very clean and there were bathrooms designated for male and female. The shower room was clean. Not once during my visit did I have to wait. There is a restaurant/bar attached to the hotel called Annabelle's, but I did not get a chance to try it. In the morning, the hotel offers coffee and muffins and there was always a lovely basket of red delicious apples through out the day at the reception area. The hotel's elevator is large and efficient and runs well. A snack machine and a vending machine for water/sodas is located on the bottom floor.The location is wonderful.

Bloomies, Ross, Old Navy, Westfield Shopping Center within a stones throw of this hotel. There is a Denny's and a Mel's Drive In Restaurant and Starbucks just around the corner too.

The key for the minibar was broken, so I'm not sure an employee or a previous guest ate or drank something. Room was small, even though I seemed to have one of the bigger rooms on the floor, based on the emergency floor plan. My room number was 709 facing O'Farrell. I had a view of the Columbia Hotel (rundown) and a view of the Hilton kitty corner to the Serrano.The bathroom was small. There was no room to place toiletries. I had to use part of the bathtub and the top of the toilet to place toiletries. The toilet location was awkward. You couldn't close the door to use it, if you know what I mean. The shower pressure was excellent.The rooms along O'Farrell don't have enough sound insulation from the road noise below. I can't imagine what it must sound like on the lower floors.Room service selections sparse for a supposed 4-star hotel and you must order between 5-10pm for dinner.The area isn't too bad. Just don't go west or south (Tenderloin). Go north, and you hit Nob Hill. Go east, and you hit Union Square.If you need parking, park across the street at the California Garage for $32 total. It was advertised as $26 with in and out privileges, but there is a 25% tax on parking (RIP OFF). But it's better than paying $44 at the Serrano.What else? The fitness center was well equipped. It had 2 treadmills, a recumbant bike, 2 elliptical trainers, and I think it was one of those ski things. Anyways, the cardio equipment were equipped with personal cable TV's. It had a small area for free weights, had one multi-purpose lifting machine, and a weight bench. It was satisfactory.The business center was pay per use.Check-in was friendly; however, checkout was not after expressing my dissatisfaction with the outside noise on the O'Farrell side of the hotel.Overall, NOT a 4-star.

Breakfast was a nice add, with cereals, waffles, coffee, etc. The locations is good, with plenty of things to do within walking and ease of finding a cab for the things that weren't close. Overall, an unbelievable deal for a weekend night stay in San Francisco!\nquestion: Was the breakfast at the hotel delicious?",

The room had an aweful musty odour, furniture and soft furnishings looked tired and the carpet was in a terrible state. After the first night , I woke up with a very itchy rash. This deteriorated as the days went by and by the time I got back to the UK, the rash was covering my entire body including my face. Uncertain of what was happening to my body, I was in a great deal of distress fearing the worst.The rash was so itchy and so unsightly that I was obliged to cancel all my clinics ( I am a doctor) and research work. I saw a dermatologist who immediately and without any hesitation diagnosed bed bug bites. I believe that this is absolutely unacceptable and shocking!! Bed bug bites are known to be a source of transmission of Hepatitis B and Chagas disease which are both potentially fatal conditions. There have also been reports of death by anaphylactic shock in the unlucky few. However, what is even more appalling is that I have paid good money ($180/night) only to suffer this very horrific outcome which has caused me great distress and affected my productivity at the conference in San Francisco as well as affecting my work, my patients and my income. It has also essentially ruined what has been a very expensive and potentially rewarding trip to San Francisco.There is also a risk that the bed bugs may have been transported to my home in my suitcase with a hazard to all at home and a great deal of expense and hassle to eradicate.Phoned management who said they will get back to me but they haven't despite emailing them and also notifying them in the post.\nquestion: How would you rate the room, good or bad?",

Valet parking at the entrance was always very convenient. Was able to call from the room to have the car at the door in 10 - 15 minutes. Pricey parking at $43.00 per night, plus tax, but not much more than the other garages around the hotel. I liked walking out the door and climbing right into the car each time we needed it. Front Desk staff was courteous and efficient. Our room on the 26th floor faced West and had a beautiful view. Room was clean, nicely sized with a King bed, large desk, two comfortable chairs, and adjustable end table. Furniture a bit dated and worn, but nothing I would complain about. Bathroom was roomy and clean, albeit again a bit dated but decent. Marble counter in bath. Excellent shower head with great pressure. Love the Portico bath products! Small, funky looking TV that I enjoyed watching the news while using the bathroom. Hallways were kept clean. Generally very quiet. No issue with noise. Elevators didn't have unreasonably long waits, usually under two minutes if that. Property was generally very well kept and felt upscale. Not top notch luxury, but very nice for what it is. Ate breakfast both mornings at the Grandview restaurant on the 36th floor. Most incredible views of the city. I suggest going up there just to have a look. Food was pricey as is usually the case at a hotel restaurant, but we wanted the convenience of being able to grab a quick bite as we had a busy schedule. Wait staff was very good and friendly. Food tasty, no complaints. We paid $159.00 for our room booking directly on the Hyatt website, using the Senior Citizen rate. I believe the AAA rate is the same. For the money it was an excellent value. I recommend this hotel and most likely will consider this hotel as a first option on future trips to San Francisco. Best point, location, location, location, and if you can get a high floor, the views.\nquestion: How good was the breakfast?",

The downtown location cannot be beat for its proximity to San Francisco's mass transit system (within one block to the Bart and Muni, and one block to the famous Powell Street Cable car). We stayed in a shared-bath queen which was small but very clean. The bath/shower and separate bathrooms were clean and well maintained. Our room had a closet,sink, bath robes, towels, soaps, ironing board and iron, a cute little TV with cable/pay movies, and CD radio. The room was a little warn the first night, but after running the overhead fan and opening the windows (no AC), the room temperature became tolerant. It was a little noisy outside but noise from other rooms was virtually non-existent (a nice surprise for me). Breakfast was minimal (coffee, tea, and excellent fresh muffins), but was included in the room rate. Speaking of room rates, you would have to be a travel agent to get a better deal in downtown SF than our rate booked through their website ($55/night + tax). At check-in we were offered an en-suite queen upgrade for and additional $20 but declined. I'm glad I did and the money we saved was well spent elsewhere in the city. The hotel also stored our luggage after we checked out, and the front desk agent even made a reservation for us at the restaurant next door.

I thought I had found a great bargain in an expensive city (I had a discount for $100 off a 2 night stay) and was prepared to give this hotel 4 stars. After reading other users' reviews, I've changed my opinion--I think I'm going to have to start using Priceline! Hearing that people stayed here for $75 a night makes me feel like I got ripped off since we paid just under $200 a night (without the discount). We figured for that price, the location, and the Hyatt name, it would be worth the price. Thinking back, the hotel was really nothing special. It was ok as far as decor, and the room wasn't THAT small. We were only on the 5th floor, so we had no view. Also, you could hear people talking in the hall and in adjacent rooms, which was annoying. I don't think the hotel has a pool (not that we found, anyway) which would be an amenity you would expect to find at most of the larger hotels. The parking fee was outrageous! The staff was friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions of where to eat.

Finally I went to another bellman and said that guy said I cant park her but I need to check in.. He said &quot;sorry&quot; and when and got my luggage. I don't know if the was a language problem or what? But it not the usual greeting I get at hotels. I complained as I checked in and got a cool response apology. It was Valentine Day weekend and stayed in the Lotus Suite. I had flowers delivered and I noticed the bell man had them in his hand in a box.. I quietly said to him why do you have the flowers in your hand in a box, it supposed to be in the room as a surprise. He seemed not to understand as he puts the flower down on the dresser, I ask can I get a vase? It was a weird start to a trip at a 5 star hotel. The trip got better because the Lotus Room was simply beautiful and the view was spectacular out each window. I say through out my 3 day stay, I didn't find the front desk to be that friendly like other 5 star hotels, but the room made up for the lack of good customer service. A week after I the trip I received a request for a customer survey like many hotels send. I gave the hotel great marks besides customer service. When I marked down customer service then the survey ask me why low on customer service and I told them what happen when I arrived. Within a week I received a scolding letter from the hotel customer service supervisor mad because I marked them down in customer service. I couldn't believe it? They were saying will we investigated and they were making excuses for the bellman and said the bellman said he was sorry. Which didn't happen the other bellman said sorry for his co worker. But it wasn't just that incident that made me give low grades on customer service, it was the overall way they treated us. They didn't greet you as you pass the lobby, didn't rush to open the door as you came and they weren't that friendly or welcoming. I wasn't going to write a review on this hotel but when I got a scolding letter from the hotel because I marked them down was very insulting. When I wrote back and told them well I thought the customer service could be better and that I never got a apology from the bell man, they NEVER wrote back or responded to my letter it was like they just want to tell me off about my survey answers.

Everyone from the front desk, the concierge, the maid service and valet -- is always polite and prompt to take care of our many requests (we travel a lot and tend to be picky). The location is great. For shoppers, Union Square is paradise. The main entrance to Chinatown is a short 2 blocks walk away. North Beach is a 10 minute cab ride, F'sherman's Wharf and Pacific Heights are about 15 min by cab. The Ferry Bldg with its fabulous new weekend market is about 5 mins away.

Usually when I come into town I stay at the Campton Place hotel on Union Square, which I have always liked for being an upscale but smaller and more personal hotel with great value rates. While the location for the Campton Place is better (the Fairmont is at the top of Nob Hill and while it has stunning views it can be a bit of a hike to get someplace, or you need to take a taxi), I was impressed with the Fairmont this time around and would stay there again.I was given a beautiful, large renovated room on the 6th floor with a view of the garden courtyard and a distant view of the Transamerica Tower. There was not a problem with noise this time around and I did not hear anyone in the surrounding rooms. Room service was efficient and very good, and the quality of everything from the bed linens to the bathroom fixtures was very luxurious.Parking is expensive at $57 a day and I paid it because I needed access to my car for business appointments outside the city. If you can avoid it, you should, as getting a taxi was very easy through the nice doormen at the front of the hotel.The business center is accessable with your room key and has internet access, printers and fax machines.

Once at the hotel there was a short check-in line, but there was an employee greeting people in the line and thanking them for their patience. Once thru the line we were quickly checked in and head up to our room on the 26th floor. It is definitely worth the little extra for a higher room because of the view, but mainly because of the glass elevator ride each time you go to and from the room. The room was a nice size and had a flat screen TV (with actual HD programming) and of course the heavenly bed was great. We used the concierge a couple of time and Glen was great giving suggestions for things to do and places to eat, and remembered our names the second day we saw him. However one of the other concierges was not as friendly and he acted as we were inconveniencing him with numerous questions. The location is great right on Union Square, close to shopping and adjacent to the cable car line.

No big deal if they wouldn't charge you 35 bucks for the missing laundry upon departure. Or the mini bar: When you arrive, everything is great. You drink a bottle of wine the first night, they will remove the used wine glasses the next morning, but never give you new glasses. About the bar area: The bar is really nice and fun and fully packed with young local people on the weekends. All seats are &quot;reserved&quot;, but there is no way you can reserve a seat in advance (even for hotel guests), unless you order a bottle of Vodka or better for 140 USD.They offer you seating in the lobby, which is very windy, if not stormy. Whenever someone opens the the main door of the hotel a tremendous wind blows right into the lobby.Besides all these little hicups, the Clift is a fancy and nicely designed hotel for a reasonable price. The rooms are clean, designed by Starck and Schrager and the staff tries to be helpful. If you want better services you may want to chose the Ritz Carlton or Mandarin Oriental, where you pay about 50% more.Not recommended for families: The restaurant does not have any kids menu!Try to get a room to the back: The street in front of the hotel is very noisy!!!\nquestion: Is this bar excellent?",

It couldn't compare with the Westin St. Francis which promises to make your children feel welcome (wecome pkg, etc.). There is not a speck of personal service or attention here. I have always thought of the Westin as a nice hotel and this trip changed my mind. It falls under the Marriott. I will admit that I stayed in a Hampton Inn overnight on a road trip, once, and the room &amp; service was as nice or nicer than this. Our children are the quietest, most well-behaved children (per others) and they said they didn't feel welcome there and actually complained when we pulled into the Westin SF Airport on our last night. Luckily, we spent most of our time out of our room, because it was nothing special and not as nice as our home. The floors were also pretty dirty. The &quot;large&quot; windows were not as large as most hotels where I've stayed and the view was bad...and I am a Starwood member; which obviously means nothing. We also had 2 charges that were not ours but they took them off without question and very nicely...they were so obviously not our charges. Room service breakfast was also speedy and friendly. You also have to ask for toiletries. Typically, one would find a shower cap and body soap, but the rooms are only stocked with shampoo and hand soap - nothing more. The recession has hit the hotels! Our room did NOT have the heavenly beds either. They were not great actually; we know heavenly beds, and did have them following our stay when we went to the airport Westin, and the difference is discernable. I can't imagine we just got a bad room.Do not take restaurant recommendations from the concierge; do your own homework! We had a restaurant picked out and the concierge told us she knew of a better one. We should have been clued in when she gave us a post it to give the owner with his name and her full name on it. It wasn't very good and was filled with tourists. Not a single ethnic person in a Chinatown restaurant!?! It was not good and she was obviously getting a kickback from them. (I believe in the form of chinese takeout!) We were unhappy.All in all, if you can get a cheap room and do not want anyone to talk to you from the hotel, stay here.

Another thing that we really loved is their commitiment to recycling and the green effort. It was evident everywhere and that made us feel good about staying there as well. Luke made a copy of the shows that were at nearby venues for us and we were in our room only for a few minutes when we got a call from him letting us know that there was a secret Weezer show a few blocks away in case we were interested. He sent us to Philz coffee shop a few blocks away - excellent - we returned several times during our stay. The breakfast in the morning was great and unexpected. We loved the eclectic surroundings and this reminded us of one of our favorite hotels in Austin, TX - the Austin Motel - same groovy vibe and fabulous staff and guests every time.

The wireless Internet service was a little weak, but we were able to use it (and it was free). We wanted something downtown, convenient to the Palace Hotel, where my wife was attending a convention. It's about 3 block to Union Square and all the major shopping. The Palace was about 6 blocks, and there were plenty of restuarants within walking distance. You can also walk to Chinatown. Do get your bearings from the desk clerk, because there is an area nearby that should be avoided. We did without a car for the first 3 days because of the $39 valet parking fee at the hotel, and we really didn't have to drive anywhere. We then rented a car for a couple of days so we could drive down to Carmel and up to Napa. there are plenty of car rental places within a few blocks of the hotel and you can park overnight for about $12 in a garage about a block and a half away. So getting around worked out very well. We tried the restuarant for breakfast only, but it was good. In general, the restuarants downtown are very expensive, but our meals were very good.

Parking was expensive at $43/night but that is pretty standard in cities like San Francisco. We were able to walk a couple blocks to get to Fisherman's Wharf - a great area to stroll around and browse the various seafood, shops, and views off the piers. We were able to get to Chinatown with a 15 minute walk. The two things I loved about this hotel - the breakfast buffet and the outdoor firepits. Outside there are several semi-private sitting areas, each of which included a firepit. We bought a bottle of wine and just chilled outside, a fantastic and cozy way to finish off the night. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was pleasantly surprising. They offered small personal frypans with cooked veggie omelettes and home fries. My gf got a strawberry yogurt parfait while I was scooping up the salmon lox with capers. There was plenty of the standard continental fare in addition to the fresh mixed fruits.

The staff was helpful and friendly to a fault, and the breakfast at Cafe Andree located in the hotel itself was wonderful. Except fot the size of the room, i would have given Hotel Rex 5 stars.

I had booked at the Holiday Inn Financial district, because they were offering the best last minute deal I could find (around $100/ night standard room, $140 executive) and I assumed that a business hotel chain would be reliable. Also, the roof top swimming pool and spa sounded nice. Rooms were described as recently renovated. I upgraded to an executive room, which was supposed to give free access to the business center. The room was spacious, and had a breathtaking view of the bay. The king sized bed was comfortable. But decor was ugly and looked dirty (impossible to tell if it actually was, with a mottled mustard and khaki-ish colour scheme). The bathroom looked like it had not been renovated since the 70's! The tub was stained and had no plug, the shower didn't work properly, the walls around the bathtub/shower were not even tiled, they were plastic. I was reluctant to bathe, frankly. As for the &quot;business center&quot;, it consisted of a small room with a couple of computers wired to a printer. You could get the key at reception. The roof top pool is minute, but has a great view. And the spa is fully booked weeks ahead anyway. I couldn't wait to get out of there, and only stayed 1 night. I found last minute vacancies at the very pleasant and luxurious Omni nearby, for a similar price to the one I was paying at the Holiday inn, and moved out asap.

It was great to be able take a couple of waters with us for the days adventures. The breakfast was super, it was neat to see the staff come up with a new dish everyday. What I thought was cool was that the dish was homemade and not just fom the freezer. On Cinco de Mayo we had a mexican style quiche. In the lobby they had a different cookie everyday in the cookie jar, and those could have easily just been frozen chocolate chop cookies. But each day we had a different kind of cookie (Russian tea balls, Lemon poppyseed, a shortbread of sorts, and a oatmeal chip).

It is a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf, the F Line, Pier 39 etc but is far enough away away from the &quot;ticky tacky&quot; areas. The hotel was clean and decorated nicely. The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so. The linens and bed were comfortable. The shower head was stong and the water was nice and warm.On the first part of our stay, we were in a courtyard room. This made the room seem a bit larger by the way that it was set up. When we returned later in the week we were put in an outside room. It was noisier and even with the shutters closed the light from the Safeway sign kept the room pretty bright. I work night shift and am used to sleeping during the daylight, but for people who like it dark, that might be more difficult. The second room also smelled a bit musty (think mothballs) and we could never get it aired out. Only a mild inconvenience though.The am coffee/tea/biscotti is nice. It was a nice stop before heading out for a bigger breakfast. Only participated in the evening reception once. The wine was good, but the appetizers were gone. Lots of people take advantage of this time, it was always busy.We did eat at the hotel restaurant for one breakfast. The food was ok...and the service was just ok too. Nothing to write home about for the price. Next time I would probably go somewhere else.The front desk staff recommended &quot;Fior d'Italia&quot; for a dinner reservation. It was a 2 block walk and SO great!! It was a wonderful suggestion. We also enjoyed &quot;The Stinking Rose&quot; on another afternoon.The Tuscan Inn is a great hotel and we would return again.\nquestion: Is the wine nice?",

            "input": "review: The Omni hotel is nice enough, and tries to offer decent service. But the rooms are definitely hit or miss and it is quite random whether you will get a nice accommodation. On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located downtown in the financial district. A bit far from the convention center or tourist destinations but great if you are in town for work. The staff is generally professional and helpful.The lobby is a bit small and it can be difficult to get past all the doormen to get to the desk. Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past.Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a &quot;premium&quot; room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size.Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def&quot; TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn.Premium rooms offer &quot;a courtyard view&quot;. Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual &quot;view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer.If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek.The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about.All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel. But when reservations are scarce you are better off at a more reliable property.\nquestion: Is this a real good food service?",

The concierge service was fabulous--tips, advice, tickets, anything our hearts desired. Baggage service took extra precautions with my lap top, and immediately produced our stuff when we needed our bags. The health club receptionist recommended I join the President's Club (------------, took about 2 minutes and they only wanted basic demographics). My President's Club number saved me the $10/day gym fee and the $13.95/day internet access fee. It also got me clean work out wear to borrow (I forgot my running shoes). The only service problem was waiting over an hour for a maid to bring me the shoes. I'm sure the rack rate is steep, but I would return to the hotel without a second thought if I could get a deal.

The rooms were old and a little rough around the edges, but spacious and most importantly: clean. I was in a room not facing the street, and it was very quiet. Our friends were in a room facing the street, so they had quite a bit of street noise, and they complained about water pipe noise as well, which we didn't hear. The have two free computers in the lobby, plus WIFI and comfy chairs in the lobby. Breakfast was nice (donuts, pasty, fruit, coffee, tea) but won't wow you. (There is a tasty crepery down the street). The wine in the afternoons is a nice touch, and they even let me take my glass upstairs so I could drink wine and soak in the jacuzzi tub. Oh, the honor bar prices were very reasonable, as well.The location was great for us. We took Bart from Oakland airport to the Powell street station, then walked to the hotel (we each only had a small bag). We had no trouble walking to the Ferry Building Farmer's market, chinatown, or fisherman's wharf from the hotel. There are plenty of bus stops nearby, for those who aren't walkers. We ran into some panhandlers when we were walking around at night, but we never felt unsafe.Cons: I don't think they have air conditioners, which could ba a problem sometimes (we kept our window open all night in early march to keep a breeze going), the staff wasn't terribly friendly, but they weren't bad.

San Fran is really awesome ( least place we were looking forward to whilst travelling California) however it proved to be amazing. We cycled golden gate bridge, went to Alcatraz, countless bars and restaurants and lombard road is neat too!

Everyone from the doorman to the front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff is exceptionally friendly, always upbeat, and very helpful.

I had made a couple requests months ago when I booked my room, and they were granted without a reminder! I had requested a room on the top floor, facing Jones street (as recommended by other TripAdvisor users!) I was pleased to see they had noted my requests and honored them. The room was a little small, but that didn't really bother us.. We didn't plan a trip to San Francisco to sit in our room! I couldn't wait to try out this bed so many other people have raved about, so I sat down and leaned back, and just sank in!!! It felt so comfortable, I couldn't wait to spend a night there. The view out of our room was decent, we had a pretty good view of a portion of downtown. My biggest complaint about this hotel involves the bathroom. It is definitely showing its age... but the largest problem can easily be fixed! The shower curtain is just plain TACKY. It does not match the class of the hotel by any means, and it would not be hard for Marriott to get some more neutral shower curtains that are more pleasant to look at! The provided toiletries are Bath and Body works- they smell so wonderful and are a nice touch. Parking was once again steep, at $38 a night, but I was prepared for that. It was nice to be so close to the Wharf, where we specifically wanted to be because we were taking a night tour of Alcatraz. When that was finished, it was a quick walk back to the hotel. However, the Marriott is a block or so further inland than many of the other wharf hotels... If you really want to be right on the main strip, the Courtyard or Arognaut will get you a bit closer. The Holiday Inn looked pretty run down, at least from the outside. When we got back to our hotel, we went over to the bar to get some dessert. The menu was rather limited, and nothing looked that great, so we decided to get a pizza to bring back to our room. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we had a great nights' sleep! My husband, however, didn't enjoy the feather bed, but I sure did! It must have been because our room faced Jones Street, but we had absolutely no problem with noise. This is a great hotel, and I had a wonderful experience. I would stay here again, though if I visit San Francisco again, I would prefer to stay in the more immediate downtown area rather than on Fisherman's Wharf.

The only downside to this place is what I have noticed consistently comes up in reviews, and that is the noise level. Because the hotel looks to have been built many decades ago, the walls are extremely thin and are not insulated. Every closing door sounds like a slam, and whenever someone walks down the hall it is noticable. The place was no noisier than any other hotel, but the sounds are much more amplified because of the lack of insulation.

The Hotel will also organise for Resteraunt delivery if you require it.

The hotel is in a great location, just outside the BART station, with a direct train to-from the airport. There is a lift from the station up to the street. The area around the station is a bit seedy with a lot of down-and-outs but no hassle experienced. It is a good spot for shopping (Westfield Centre across the street &amp; Union Square area up the street a couple of blocks). Cable car turntable is just along the street. Powell-Hyde route is best - but busiest.The hotel was spotlessly clean. The rooms were excellent. There are 30 floors, some great views over the city.I see in petthekat's review that Maria on reception gets a mention. She also sorted us out. When we came back for our second stay, one of our rooms did not appear on the register &amp; the hotel had overbooked (apparently it does this a lot). But Maria sorted it - we got 2 rooms on the 29th floor reasonably close to each other. Luckily we had arrived at 4 p.m., I don't know what would have happened if we'd arrived at 11 p.m. One gripe : the hotel charges $15 a day for WiFi.

            "input": "review: My two favorite hotels in SF are the MO and the Inn Above Tide in Sausalito. I've stayed in the Four Seasons and the Ritz and many other hotels in SF. Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me.I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view.The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet.Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area.The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.Overall, the hotel is worth splurging for the best rooms and we plan to come back every summer.\nquestion: How nice is the view?",

I read the reviews on Tripadvisor, but somehow I thought how bad could the hotel be, it is in such a good neighborhood. I knew right away I had made a bad choice of hotels when we took the elevator to our room and it smelled of urine. When we got to our room, the door was wide open and the electricity didn't work. The carpets were utterly filthy. I had an asthma attack immediately. I almost broke down into tears, knowing I had booked 7 days, and it was nonrefundable, but I couldn't cry in front of my kids. I went back to the front desk and asked if he could change us to a clean room or a remodeled room, which would mean cleaner carpet. He kindly upgraded us to a suite, which was a lot better. I thought we could manage now. There were many other guests at the hotel from all walks of life going about their BUSINESS. I did not feel safe in my room as the locks on the door were a bit loose. There were liqour bottles and bags of garbage left outside peoples doors for more than 12 hours at a time. The staff did not clean it up. The car park also had garbage people had emptied out of their car and just left it there. Also, where they kept their trash, it was piled 20 feet high in black bags, along with the local bum going through it. When I was parking my car one night, I came across a young man emptying out a car and taking out the speakers. I didn't say anything, as he saw me in my car and my three kids.

Great views, and a long desk stretching across the full length of the room near the windows.Given the location, at first we were a little worried about not being within walking distance of Union Square (or the cable cars/Muni), but hey - it's San Francisco. Everything's close. Market Street, Union Square, BART, and North Beach are all just a short distance on foot. You can catch the cable car at California Street...which is even closer. In fact, we found it kind of nice to be out of the uber-touristy area of Union Square proper. We were right on the border of Chinatown, and wound up spending some time in North Beach - a cool area that I had never frequented up until this point.My only complaint is this: the Hilton is one of those hotels that charges you $160 a night for a room...then still wants you to pay them $10 a day to access the internet. Even going to the business center to check your email results in the same charge. I know that a lot of people stay here on business, so I imagine the hotel thinks it can milk a little extra from its guests by allowing them to employ the &quot;Oh, the company's paying for it, no big deal&quot; mindset...but come on. It's 2006. And it's San Francisco, people! The Google company shuttle stops down the street! Get with the program. Overall, though, a wonderful experience.

Not only did they price us double the price we orginally got but also did understand the connection of having already booked a room for the next two nights. So instead I called priceline and booked a room for a much lower price. I have to admit I rather deal with priceline than direct service with Hyatt. Which says alot about Hyatt's overall customer service. But the bummer or reason for this low review is that after we left on Sunday they charged two charges on a debt card that was only used for the bar. This debt card was not used to hold the rooms nor were they given to the front desk. We called to ask about the charges and they say they could not help us. Only the accounting department could help. We asked them how was it possible not to be able to tell us what the charges were for. The lady on the line say its because they we a high end hotel therefore other departments took care of such things. Told us the accounting department will call us. They did not after two days! Only to reverse the charges 3 days later without a call or notice. I think this has to be the worst customer service I ever recieved from a hotel Econolodge even has better service.

I was totally taken with the personable and helpful staff, as well as the charming architecture and decor. One of my companions was a native San Franciscan and has family is in the hotel/hospitality business, so we could have stayed at any of the large super-hotels, but she recommended this one.She did us a favor! The Cornell was excellent overall: the rooms, spotless, with fresh flowers; the restaurant very nice; the location very convenient and seems safe enough, near Chinatown and Union Square with numerous restaurants and some small shops within walking distance. We even met Monsieur Lambert, the owner, and his daughter. Simply charming!\nquestion: Does this hotel have a good staff?",

The location was ideal for us as we used the cable cars to get around, although we had to walk to Fisherman's Wharf and back twice as the long waits between cars meant that the queues were just too long. The walk took less than half an hour so it was no real issue. We much preferred the quiet location on Nob Hill to either Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf. As previous reviewers have stated, the lobby is absolutely beautiful. The restaurant is also stunning and breakfast each morning was a relaxing way to start the day. The food selections were very good and service was excellent. We visited the Tonga Room, just to have a quick drink and ended up with a $70 bill because of the entertainment charge - a very expensive way to spend 20 minutes! Not to be repeated.We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. We also greatly enjoyed seeing all the old photos on the walls - a reminder of the Fairmont's historical past. The photos of the Fairmont standing alone amidst the desolation of the earthquake were especially moving.We had booked 2 interior rooms, but on arrival agreed to share a room on the first night as the hotel had overbooked. We shared an exterior room which was huge and we were then upgraded to the tower for the following 3 nights where we had wonderful views right across the bay. Furnishings were of a similar high quality in both rooms.We loved the Fairmont and would highly recommend the hotel.\nquestion: Does this hotel have a good city view?",

We spent the whole day away from the hotel, and after a wonderful meal at Scomer's on Fisherman's Wharf, when we got back we decided to end the evening with an Irish coffee. It was 10:45pm and the first thing we were told was to hurry up with our order because they were closing at 11pm. The Irish coffe was bitter, cold, and I'm certain they forgot the liqor. The night was punctuated with noise, and at one point at around 4 am some errant person was shouting profanities right outside our door, leading my wife not being able to sleep for the rest of the night.

My $11 margarita was made with sweet &amp; sour. YukI thought the rooms were terrible. The scandavavian furniture reminded me of IKEA. Small rooms, even smaller bathrooms. Platform beds not comfortable. There was no real furniture in the room - except the unit that housed the 19&quot; TV and minibar.

The cab driver took us right through the middle of the Tenderloin District which is on the way to the hotel if you take a direct route off the freeway from the airport. The Tenderloin district is a &quot;pit of despair&quot; to quote our Frommers Guide Book. (We read about it after we got to the hotel.) The hotel is right on the edge of this district, and so we thought we had made a big mistake to book a hotel in such a bad neighborhood. (We didn't know anything about this when we booked.) To give the hotel credit, the rooms were a decent size and very clean. The walls, however, are very thin, and we had a situation in the middle of the night where the people next door kept us awake just by talking. The service is excellent. The hotel staff at the reception could not have been more helpful. As we had not paid a very high price for this hotel, we learned once again that you get what you pay for. I think in hindsight that we should have booked a more expensive hotel and done more research on the location of the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend only because of its location. If they were on a tight budget, I would tell them it is decent hotel for the money, but to be very careful where they walk. San Francisco downtown, by the way, is very typical of large American cities, which means you always want to know where your purse or wallet is, and to avoid eye contact with the many homeless and panhandlers.\nquestion: Why do I have a great breakfast place?",

We had absolutely no problems with our room or the &quot;thin walls&quot; other reviewers complained about.
