It blurred the ink over many of the pages. [Oh no.] And so one of the guys had the bright idea of drying the pages by the fire while we watched, uh, the rest game, but a spark from the fire must have blown out and burned the manuscript to a crisp.

Henry: Well, actually, her computer crashed the day before while I was playing some computer games, and I haven't been able to get it to work since. Sam: Man, are you in trouble now.

You see about a week ago, I was doing some yard work, and I was using some weed killer [UH-oh.], yeah, to try to get rid of some terrible weeds and ... Susan: Did you spray the roses? Mark: Uh, well, not exactly. I set the spray container down near the roses while I was trimming a bush, and the container must have gotten knocked over, and the weed killer soaked into the ground near the roses. Susan: How much weed killer are you talking about? Mark: Uh, about six or seven quarts (about six liters or 1.6 gallons), I think. [Oh, that's a lot.] You know, I mean when you put ... Susan: And the roses? What do they look like now? Mark: Oh, Dead, real dead. Dead as a doornail dead, but my wife hasn't seen them yet. Susan: Really? What have you done? Blindfolded her? Mark: Well, I've kept her away from that side of the house where the roses are, but she is bound to see them at some point. Susan: Yeah, yeah. You've got a problem.

It takes a lot of energy. But that's not part of my paper, so I guess I should leave it out.

It's not like just sitting down somewhere and watching the clouds roll by. That's different. W: Then you'll have to include that in your point.

Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago. W: Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in.

M: Well the record was in 1989 when 249 million bottles of champagne was sold. The highest production level was reached in 1990 with a total of 293 million bottles. Of course since those boom years sales have fallen. W: Has the market been badly hit by the recession? M: Oh certainly, the economic problems in champagnes' export markets that's Europe, the United States, Japan, and of course the domestic market in France, the economic problems have certainly been one reason for the decrease in champagne sales. W: And the other reasons? M: Another important factor has been price. In the early 90s, champagne was very overpriced, so many people stop buying it. Instead they bought sparkling wines from other countries, in particular from Australia and Spain. And then there was another problem for champagne in the early 90s. W: What was that? M: There was a lot of rather bad champagne on the market. This meant the popularity of good sparkling wines increased even more.

Support for all your ideas is essential. I think you should check the statistics on what percentage of women hold political office in the national governments.

If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr Stewart, how does poetry help? M: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er... W: I do, yes. M: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if... W: I think it's if. M: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it. W: Yes, I see. M: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients. W: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries? M: Yes, many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders. I mean their patients said that, that reading poetry made them feel less stressed. You know, almost as many said that writing it has the same effect. You see, some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily! W: Yes, it certainly is! M: Era. Others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers. And writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions. W: Em, that's fascinating! Can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way? M: Well, it's only a guess. But I say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the.., you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm. Now, I believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions, you see. W: Do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions? M: No, no, no. I think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed. People who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed, probably because they are in touch with their emotions. I mean they certainly don't need a doctor to tell them which poems to read.

Hmmm. It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan. Customer: Well, what is the main difference between these cars? Agent: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you? Customer: Just me and my son. Rental Car Agent: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front. Customer: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so. Rental Car Agent: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows. Customer: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway? Rental Car Agent: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day. Customer: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage? Rental Car Agent: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas. Customer: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices. Rental Car Agent: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand. Customer: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me. Rental Car Agent: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day. Customer: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like?

Rental Car Agent: Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan? Customer: What's that exactly? Rental Car Agent: Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem. Customer: But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems? Rental Car Agent: It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company.

Interviewer: Oh, I think I can do that. What else? Alex: When drinking or eating something outside, you should keep the garbage until you find a trashcan to put it in because littering makes our planet dirty. Do you like seeing trash all over the ground? Interviewer: No, I don't. Do you have any final suggestions? Alex: Yes. We shouldn't waste paper because trees are being cut down to make the paper. By recycling paper, we save the forests where animals live. Interviewer: So, how can children recycle paper, I mean, everyday? Alex: Well, for example, when I was in kindergarten, I used to save the newspapers so that I could make things make out of them, like paper trees, instead of just throwing them away.

I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies.

M: What you are really saying is that we'd make more profit by selling bikes abroad, where we have,a cost advantage and can charge high prices. W: Exactly. M: But, wait a minute. Packaging, shipping, finaetc. will push up our cost and we could end up no better off, maybe worse off. W: OK. Now there are extra costs involved. But if we do it right, they can be built into the price of the bike and we can still be competitive. M: How sure are you about our chances of success in the foreign market? W: Well, that's the sticky one. It's going to need a lot of research. I'm hoping to get your help. Well, come on, Jack. Is it worth it, or not? M: There will be a lot of problems. W: Nothing we can't handle. M: Um... I'm not that hopeful. But, yes, I think we should go ahead with the feasibility study. W: Marvelous, Jack. I was hoping you be on my side.",

In my case I was made redundant, and, when it came to looking around for a new job, I just couldn't face going back into an office again. So I sat down and thought about what I'd really like to do. Interviewer: And that, I suppose, turned out to be something in the country? Roger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring. Interviewer: So what happened, why didn't you? Roger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again. Interviewer: Couldn't you have learned while on the job sort of picked it up as you went along? Roger: No, you have to have a diploma. Anyway, after talking it over with friends who had moved out I thought I'd like to give it a try--after all, a change of scene... Interviewer: Is better than.., yes, we all know that. So, where did you go when you did decide to move? Roger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own. Interviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills? Roger: I'd always had a garden and grown some vegetables and flowers, you know, usual things, salad stuff, carrots, peas, beans, a bit of fruit, some roses.., so I thought of a small holding, a kind of small farm. But when I looked at the prices to buy, I changed my mind; I didn't have that kind of money. Interviewer: OK, a farm's out--so what's next?

Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.

Do you mind saying something about your divorce? W: No. I got divorced years ago. Even worse, I got divorced when I had small children. M: Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives. W: Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children. M: How? W: We tell them we love them and will always do. M: You haven't thought of saving the marriage? W: Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer. M: Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it. W: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing. M: Yet most people believe a had marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think? W: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarrelling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children. M: What do you want society to do for you? W: Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future.",

Every time a truck went by, I would shout a word that sounded like a track, but to everyone else, it sounded nothing like it. My parents tried to correct me, but failed. Then, about three months later, we traveled to New York, as we were waiting for our plane at the air?port. I looked out of a huge window, at that very moment I saw the largest truck in the world, I had to tell someone about this. I turned to my father who was standing next to about a thousand people waiting for the very flight and screamed \"Track! Track!\" My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited, I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and then ran into the ladies-room where she hid until I finally stopped.

Tutor: No-right-they've got some powerful packages in the computer graphics and CAD offices-you'll enjoy that. So... that leaves English. It's mostly English lit.

That's great - if they've got classes at my level. I don't have any problem speaking-but my writing is terrible. Tutor: Oh, I'm sure they have-go and talk to them in the EAP department-oh, and I suggest you join the study-skill classes, too. They will have sessions on report and so on. Anna Maria: Great-I really need some help with my writing, especially spelling. Tutor: Well, that would be in the EFL classes-study-skills would help more with how to structure your essays and so on... now, your last module... Anna Maria: Yeh... well... I gave up biology at school to do physical-but I much prefer biology -I'd like to study some more While I can but German is very important in technical subjects, so I want to do that too. Tutor: Well, you could do it as an option next year-you do know that? Anna Maria: No, I don't-I mean, I didn't cheek. Tutor: Yes... yes, I think that's the thing to do-concentrate on your English this year you could take Cambridge proficiency-and you'll need LELTS for the first year of the degree -start the German next year.

What on earth happened to you? Andrew: Why are you always so blunt? Andrew's Sister: Well, I'm your big sister. I'm ... what am I? Three years older than you, and I can be blunt if I want. Besides, you used to say stuff like that to me all of the time. You used to call me fatso all the time when I was little.

Look at my running shoes over there. Andrew's Sister: Andrew. They're still in the box. ( Well ... ). Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful.

Don't eat late at night. [ What? Like what? ] Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat.

Andrew: It's low-calorie (ice cream). Andrew's Sister: Low cal. No, it's not low-cal. Look right here. Andrew! That's all the food you've got in here is ice cream. Andrew: Well, what else, what else?

W: You were educated in the public schools? M: We moved almost every year, so I went to a different public school each year. W: So you would have been in high school and what years... approximately? M: Oh, I was in high school when... 26 or 27? I forgot. I graduated from high school in 32. W: What did you study in university? M: Well, that's a difficult question. I started out thinking I'd be an economist, and then I got disappointed with that. And after an odd experience in my junior year, I decided that I'd go out and study agriculture or management, but I enrolled in both for a whole year and tried to learn the required courses. I lasted a year, and then I came back to the main campus and finished up as an economics major specializing in labor economics. W: Did you go right graduate school or join the army after you graduated from the university? M: Well, I went to Harvard as a graduate student in philosophy in 1936, and stayed there until the war broke out. I was drafted after I took my PhD exams in the early part of 1941. So I went into the army before Pearl Harbor.",

M: I think we, we have a rich heritage of proverbs - the Benjamin Franklin maxims, proverbs, wise sayings have been handed down to us. W: Well, I think the fact that we're no longer creating proverbs today maybe says something ... maybe perhaps explains to some extent why proverbs in certain cultures were not as extended or extensive as in other cultures.

I'm sure there are some, but I wonder why this is so. W: Yeah, well, I think we all know a great many proverbs. If we sit down, we can think of some that we can ... we can list. But we don't seem to use them to explain things. We find many times that they're used too much and too simple - too general. Today we're much more sophisticated, you might say, and analytical, and therefore we don't use proverbs to explain things the way, say, our grandfathers and parents did. M: Life is too complicated now to just quote a simple proverb to take care of things. W: Right, and maybe to some extent that's why the North American Indians and the Mayans among others don't have as many proverbs. At least there's no record of as many proverbs.

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store? M: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want. W: You mean you don't keep regular hours? M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early. W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet? M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers. W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne. We wish you success in your new business.",

Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. \"Another fattening cookie recipe.\" But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today.

It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers' will have to skip when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film.

Teacher: What do you mean? I mean ... Parent: She said you commented on her shirt and jeans, like they were from the 1970s or something like that. Teacher: Well I was just kind of joking a little bit with her. Parent: Well, yeah, that's what you think, but other kids follow your example. In fact, one of the kids took a picture of her with their phone and posted it and had some real nasty comments on Facebook. It was terrible. Teacher: Well, you know, kids can be kids.

I really hope I can get Megan to come to school tomorrow. She's been really, really anxious and depressed [ Wow. ] for some time, and your comments and those that the other kids made haven't helped.

W: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. M: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? W: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me. M: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? W: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors. M: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting. W: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. M: Are there any other advantages do you find? W: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that.

M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.",

M: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true. W: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening. M: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi. W: Did Twain like that job? M: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck. W: That's interesting! M: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings.

How's your little boy, has he started school yet? Ross: Oh, yes, he's in the second year now. Fisher: What, already? Doesn't time fly! Is he enjoying it? Ross: Very much, it's much more fun than being home! Fisher: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business? Ross: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly? Fisher: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30. Ross: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand? Fisher: Yes, yes--and drinks and snacks at the end. Ross: Better to have buffet lunch? Fisher: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday. Ross: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February. Fisher: Oh, that'll be fine. Ross: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis. Fisher: Free, fine, yes. Ross: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like? Fisher: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working? Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?

I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday? Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations... Ross: 100?! Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people. Ross: Yes, but the room won't... Fisher: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.

W: It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace. In my opinion, communication means interaction and is vital in business. It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients. M: Can you explain that more precisely? W: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.

It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional. M: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues? W: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success. M: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization. W: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings.

People drinking or the extras that would be included on the tariff after a certain time of night. W: You mean they argue with you over money? M: Yes, that can happen. Or the way.., the good thing is, people can argue about the way that you go to a certain route because they always know better. But nine times out of ten the route that they take you is far longer so, you know, they're the eventual losers. W: So if you do have a difficult passenger you want to get rid of what do you do? M: I'd stop the cab and tell them to get out. W: Does that often happen? M: Mmm, it's happened to me three times. And they've got out. So I, I myself haven't had a lot of problems with difficult people, you know. W: When you pick up tourists as passengers, what kind of places do they like to go to? M: Suppose the most famous landmark is Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, maybe Harrods; but certainly Buckingham Palace.",

M: It's an expanding market, that's for sure, and they seem to be getting smaller every year. F: Which countries are dominating the market? M: At the moment it's Japan, principally. In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman? F: Is that the Walkman? M: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial. F: How big is the whole thing? M: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms. F: Was it a success from the start? M: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price! F: Really? M: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections. F: Well, you never can tell! How big was the initial production? M: The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they still couldn't keep up with the demand. F: So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher. M: It was much more radical than that! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model. F: Oh, what's it like? M: Well, it's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less... F: Mmmm. M: and the components were designed from scratch. F: And what about production levels? M: They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market! F: Wow! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off. M: Indeed it has. F: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well. M: Yes. At the end of 1982 Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I--you know, the makers of Seiko watches-well, they unveiled an even smaller TV, around 3era, which is built into a wrist-watch. F: Incredible! M: It certainly is. The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes. F: And how does it work? M: It has a liquid crystal display screen. The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket, and they're connected by a cord to the watch. F: Is there a headphone? M: Oh, yes, that's plugged into the receiver as well. F: Seems a bit complicated, that one, with all the wires and bits and pieces. M: Yes, it does. F: Any other Japanese models? M: Yes, Casio-that's C-A-S-I-O. Their latest is a calculator-sized TV about one-third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month. F: I see. M: And, according to a spokesman, they hope to match their calculator sales, which are about 25 million units per year. F: Very impressive. And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon. M: Most likely. F: Now, could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs? M: Of course. From Sinclair in England there's one similar in size to the Casio, and their production levels were 1 million for 1983. F: Obviously they're planning on backing a winner! M: How right you are. A representative said they expect a mass-market response, not just a novelty item. F: And just which market are the manufactures aiming at? M: Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work. These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides.

B: Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows. A: Fine. And turning to the new channel..., which type of programmes would you like to see more of?

A: Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them? B: I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, you know, the sound system. People are very fussy these days about that and in general I think they ought to do lots more of these kinds of interview, you know, talking with their potential customers.

Harrogate became a fashionable resort during Victorian times, when people came to take a bath in the mineral waters. Today, few people come to visit the town for its mineral waters. Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open park land right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it? M: Yes, certainly. The area is called the Stray. W: Why the Stray? M: It's called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land. W: Oh, I see. M: Then, we've changes in farming and in land ownership. The Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate. W: And is it protected? M: Oh, yes, indeed. As a special law, no one can build anything on the stray. It's protected forever. W: So it will always be park land? M: That's right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields. W: I believe it looks lovely in the spring. M: Yes, it does. There're spring flowers on the old trees, and people visit the town just to see the flowers.",

Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it.",

Okay, before I give you the bag of money, could you fill out this satisfaction survey rating your service today? Robber: Augh! Does it look like I have any time for that? Bank Teller: Ah, do me a favor! I'll even throw in an extra lollipop. Robber: Ah, tell me this isn't happening to me! Look, this is supposed to be a bank robbery, and not an afternoon picnic. Bank Teller: Alright. But I'd suggest you turn around now. Those nice police officers seem like they want to talk to you ... or something. Robber: Ah, everything's going wrong for me today!",

Man: Well, uh, for some reason I always thought raising kids would be a lot easier than it is. Woman: Yeah, I know. Tell me about it. What's, what's the problem? Man: Well, for about six months, he's been really down, and sometimes, I can't get him out of bed in the morning to go to school. He just seems so depressed. I just can't figure it out. Woman: So, this has been going on like half a year? Man: Yeah, kind of on and off, but I don't know. I ... I just thought it would just kind of go away, and I just thought things would just get, I don't know, get better. Woman: Yeah, that's not, that's pretty worrrisome. Um, I mean, I've noticed he's not hanging out with Jared very much anymore. You know, is he ... what's he doing when he's up? Man: Well, uh, a lot of the time he's not up. He just kind of uh, stays in bed. [ Really? ] I just can't figure it out. I don't know. Woman: Yeah, that's, that's a big problem. I can see why you're really worried about him. Have you considered taken him to see a therapist, or a psychologist, or anybody? Man: Ah, no. I, I ... It's probably just a phase or something. I think some kids were picking on him at school, but I think that's stopped. He doesn't talk about it anymore, so I guess that's over. Woman: So, you're saying that he was like being bullied and stuff? Man: Yes, yeah. But he didn't talk about it a lot. I thought it was just, you know, having some problems, and it just kind of would go away. Woman: Well, you know, I don't know about that with the bullying or whatever, but you know, this has been going on for a long time. You really need to seriously address it. Man: I don't know. Uh, and well, his girlfriend just broke up with him, so I guess maybe that's had an impact on him. Woman: Yeah, it has. Uh, that explains a lot. Um, have you looked at his Facebook page lately? [ What? ] He posted some stuff, well, he was posting some stuff, I think it was last night around midnight, um, yeah, talking about how much life sucks, wishing he could just disappear. [ Oh! ] Um, you know, I can't remember exactly the words he said, but I know that it really, really worried me. Some of the things he wrote are signs of, they might be thinking about suicide. Man: Ah, I, I, I just can't figure that out. I mean, kids sometimes just talk like that. I, I, I thought. I thought that was kind of natural. Woman: Yes, sometimes they do that. That's what makes it hard. Sometimes, kids just talk like that, but some of them are serious, and some of them end up talking their own lives. Some of them really do kill themselves. You know, you need to take this seriously. Six months (of being depressed) isn't normal. Six months isn't just to act like this isn't just a phase. It's, there's something going on. Man: So, any ideas? I mean, what should I do? I'm just kind of at a loss here. Woman: Oh, you know. I was talking to a woman the other day about her daughter. Um, there are crisis numbers you can call. Also, you could go to the hospital; you can do to the emergency room, and they do assessments there. Psychological assessments. [ Okay. ] Um, you know, it might be kind of hard to get him out to the hospital, to get him out to go with you if you can't get him out to go to school, but you need to take this seriously. [ Yeah ... ] You could take him down to the hospital, down to the emergency room, so ... Man: I don't know. Woman: You know, it's really important because you've got to get on top of it. He needs you; he needs to know that you really love him, that you're not just kind of ignoring this. Man: You know, I recently noticed that that I just saw some marks on his arms the other day, and I didn't know. I asked him about it. Kind of looked like some scratches, or something, and ... Woman: I saw those too, and those aren't scratches. They're too deep to be scratches. He's doing self-harm, too. Man: Oh, man. Woman: You know, um, these are really serious things, and he's crying out for help. He doesn't know how to handle what is going on in his life. He's really struggling. Man: You know, about a month ago, there was another boy in school, I think it (he) was about his age that, uh, took his own life, and I am wondering if that's had an impact on him. Woman: Umm, don't you think it would have? Man: Probably. I don't know how well he knew the boy, but uh, I don't know. Woman: Yeah, things like that do have an impact on kids, and you just can't run the risk. He might be mad at you for hauling him down to to the hospital, but you need help to find out what's going on, so that you can support him, and so you can make sure you are getting him all the help that he can have. These things are serious, and you don't want to look back later and say I wish I had done that. Man: Right. Well, yeah, send me that information, and uh, I'll start looking at it.

If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court. W: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins? M: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed. W: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves? M: That's the beauty of the whole thing. Ignorance of the law doesn't count, I'm afraid. However, the other person can counter-sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor. W: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law? M: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory. It is being worked on. The World Trade Organization has developed an agreement, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which makes sure that the patent is valid for 20 years. W: That doesn't make sense. Twenty years is a long time. M: Actually, it does. It's believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there's a 20-year limitation on the patent. On the other hand, other inventors can use the information the inventor disclosed when the product was registered. Giving the information is all part of the deal. W: Cool.",

Would you like to join me for a drink? W: Ok, thanks. M: Any news recently? W: Oh, well, I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here, you know that? M: I'm afraid not. W: Well, my real objection to this idea of a new airport is, is the whole thing is so wasteful, I mean, we know we are currently in fuel crises, we know that we've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it, and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to, ... to travel, to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil, I mean it takes a ton of oil, a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off. M: Mm... W: It seems so completely short-sighted to me. Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on, I can't see, I can't see the rationale behind really wanting an, an airport at all. M: Well, surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed. I mean, why should people, uhh... W: Well, they aren't being swarmed. M: Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of... a new airport here. W: But, but really people shouldn't be traveling that much, that's, that's why most of the journeys, I mean, they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on. It isn't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often. M: Well, you take the climate here in this country. Now just before Christmas, there was this dreadful cold spell, there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and, and a certain mild climate. And, and in summer, the same situation occurs. It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool. W: Well, yes, I can sympathize with that. But it is still not really necessary to do, well, as it isn't necessary to, to conserve fuel and it is necessary to, well, not to waste land. I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more. I mean it could be used for farming for instance. M: True. W: It could also be used for housing, or it could be used for parks, you know. People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far. M: But, airports do bring some local advantages. They bring roads, there is obviously extra employment, for instance, new hotels, shops, restaurants will have to be built. This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy. W: But you ask the people, you ask those who are now living near the airports, for instance, whether,whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages, although, all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways, and the whole area is, is desolated, isn't it? M: But the airport infra, ..., infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport, the pilots even, the stewardess, they have to live somewhere near the airport, right? W: Yeah, but it's, it's just so, so damaging to the whole area. I think, airports, from my point of view, the whole concept is outdated, really. Umm, with modern technology, we can make a lot of travel unnecessary, really. For example, it won't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody. They can just leave it to the telephone in the office, press the button, and say to the person they want to do business with. You see, business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth, right? M: Yes, you are right. But for a lot of people, personal contact is important. And this means travel, and means quick travel, air travel. And we just need a new airport.",

Blushing, even though it's unintentional, is more or less a learned behavior. W: What do you mean? M: Oh, children hardly ever blush at all. And among adults, supposedly, women blush more than men. W: I wonder why. M: I don't know, but I had a friend at high schools, Brian Smith. It was really easy to make him blush. He turned red whenever a waitress would ask him for his order.

I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \"Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?\" So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document. M: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time? W: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.",

Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful.

It would spoil my excitement if it turned out I just have a funny wrinkle on the surface of my brain, which makes me think about the invisible train platform.

That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that. Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month. That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest. Also because people will sit down and say \"oh, here are my goals\" and forget all about them. Revisiting them every week is a good way.

Let me see.., yes, here we are. You can have this. B: Thanks. A: OK I'll show you. Let's start with the lower level. See? Here? You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right. I wouldn't bother to visit the zoo if I were you, it takes quite a long time to walk round. But I do recommend the \"Touch and Feed\" section opposite, as I said. It's great fun for small children. B: Ok, so we'll pay a visit there, and then what? A: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time. Then go down the steps to the Otter Pool-you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water. Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive. B: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer? A: Yes, that's right. The fun fair is in the top left hand corner. Can you see? With \"The Dragon\" I was telling you about, and \"The Octopus\" and \"The Spider\". Do you think you'll want to go to that? B: Um, well, I think the children are a bit too young really, but they might enjoy watching other people. A: OK. Well, if you're feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive, which you probably will be, why not have a snack in the Chinese Restaurant next to the terminal? When you've finished your lunch, I would go to the Coral Reef first. It's that little building on the left hand side. \"That's where you can see fish and other underwater creatures in a kind of natural habitat. B: Right. That sounds interesting. A: It's lovely. After that, walk up to \"The Dragon\" and watch people being really scared! Then you could come down to the Ocean Theater, which is just to the left of the center of the plan- and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale. You'll have to check the times for that. There's one at two o'clock, I think. I'm not sure about the high diving, but you may be able to see that as well. If there's time, you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at Wave Cove. And finally, if you're not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator. You'd be finished by 3:30 or 4 at the latest. B: Right, well, thanks for all your advice. Urn, we'll send you a postcard! A: I'll look forward to it.",

Tim: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family. Lisa: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that? Tim: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake. Lisa: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years. Tim: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time. Lisa: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit? Tim: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities. Lisa: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely. Tim: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need. Lisa: A hotel sounds nice. Tim: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people. Lisa: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease. Tim: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park. Lisa: Wow. Tim: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important. Lisa: What about money? I have a credit card. Tim: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must. Lisa: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated? Tim: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated. Lisa: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely. Tim: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful. Lisa: Like Matches? Tim: Matches? (If) You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches. Lisa: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions. Tim: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with. Lisa: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ... Tim: Yeah, but most people thinking about it after it is too late.",

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory? W: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet. M: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease? W: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease. M: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot? W: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories. M: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories? W: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.",

Man: Well, um, many of my students wanted to become chefs in restaurants, or they wanted to start their own restaurants, uh, and in our area, there were many, uh, tourists tourist spots.

Woman: Wow. That's, that's pretty impressive. That's interesting. [ ... and tasty. ] Oh, I bet. So, why did you return to the United States? How long have you been back? Man: I've been back for, uh, probably about a year now. Woman: Okay, so what brought you back then? Man: Well, one of my former students opened a sushi restaurant, uh, in town, and he asked me to work with him. Woman: Really? What's the name of the restaurant? Man: Well, it's called Flying Sushi. Have you ever heard of it? Woman: Yes, I've been there. Their food is fabulous; it's top-notch. It's really hard just to get a reservation there. Man: I know, and uh, well, I work there two weeknights, and uh, and then ... Woman: So, two nights a week you're working there still? Man: Right, right, but then, but ... I want to return to teaching. I've also been working as a therapist at a treatment center for teenagers struggling with depression and other mental health disorders. Woman: Oh, wow, that would be a really interesting job. Man: It is, it is. Woman: Wow. You have such a wide range of experience. Uh, you know, to be honest, we have fifteen people who are applying for this position. You've got quite a background, but why don't you tell me three reasons why you would be the best person for this job. Man: Um, well, first of all, uh, I understand that different students have different learning styles, and for that reason, I have used iPads, video, music, cooking, drama, role plays, and games to reach every student. [ That's good. ] And second, I have a background in academic and psychological counseling and advising [ Uh, huh ] ... skills that are often needed, you know, in working with international students. Woman: Yeah, that could be really useful. Man: Yeah, so you know, many of them struggle with, uh, emotional turmoil, you know, home sickness .... Woman: Yeah, coming to a new place ... Man: Right, so making the transition can be very overwhelming, and uh ... Woman: Good. So, what would you say would be a third reason? Man: And finally, I speak four different languages .... Woman: Four? Wow! What languages do you speak? Man: Well, I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese at an advanced level. [ At an advanced level? Wow. ] And I also speak Arabic at a high-intermediate level. Woman: That's very, very impressive. You do have an impressive resume. Man: Thank you. Woman: Uh, what we're doing ... we're going to have two rounds of interviews, and we will contact you on Friday and let you know whether or not you'll be coming back for the second round of interviews. Man: Okay. Woman: It's been really nice meeting you, and thank you for your time.",

You see, modern houses and flats are very small; much smaller than the sort of homes people used to live in. W: And when Granny gets very old, then the situation becomes even worse, doesn't it? M: Yes. As long as old people are able to look after themselves, the system works quite well. But as soon as they need any care and attention, the situation becomes very difficult indeed. It's likely that old people may go into a nursing home, but it's not as simple as that. Because of improvements in medical science, people live longer than ever before. The birth rate has fallen. This means that a smaller working population is having to provide for a larger number of old people in need of care and attention. The number of old people's homes provided by the State is strictly limited. There are private nursing homes, but the cost is out of reach of the average family. W: And how do you see the situation developing in the future? M: Well, obviously a lot of money is going to have to be spent. But it's difficult persuading people to do this.

The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects. W: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects? M: Well, that's I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor. You can pretend that you don't like things which you are actually quite pleased about. Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who's known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight.

This is where the artistic quality comes in. W: So really, you see two types of negotiator then, the actor or the honest one. M: That's right. And both can work.

W: How did you check the scales before? M: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture. W: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less. M: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal. W: How much did it cost? M: About 45 thousand dollars. W: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much? M: I'm sure it is.

Diane: Fine. Well, let's get some details. What kind of apartment is it? Gavin: It's a two-bedroom apartment. Diane: What floor is it on? Gavin: Why do you need to know that?

I've been to many countries such as Britain, Italy and Sweden. So I spend a lot of time at airports. While waiting for my flights, I watch people passing by and start my imagination. For example, the other day, when I was waiting for my flight to Greece, I saw a couple. They were buying magazines at that moment. They were not wearing business clothes, but the man was carrying a suitcase. Every few seconds, the woman looked around. I wondered if someone was following them. Perhaps they were running away, and you know, this reminded me of a story in the newspaper that day: a bank clerk stole one million pounds a week before and disappeared with his wife. There was a picture of them in the paper. The couple really looked like the wiz. Maybe I should stop them. Just then, I saw them say goodbye to each other, and the woman walked away.

For a closer look at what's happening, we turn to Lisa Lynch, an economics professor at Tofts University. Lisa Lynch, when you look at these numbers, do you think job creation is on the rise? W: It certainly is. It was a great report. It indicates that the job market, broadly speaking, has turned the corner after 3 very long, lean years. I think we are going to see improvement. It's not only the March gain. It was gain in January and February. They were both revised higher, and moreover, the job gains were very broadly-based across many industries. It was a very positive report. M: What do you see in the numbers? Who's getting the new jobs? W: As I mentioned, when we looked at the numbers, \"we are seeing employment across the board in all sectors, with one important exception, and that's in manufacturing. Well, we do not have any job loss in manufacturing sector for the first time in 44 months. We did not see pick up in the manufacturing sector, but we saw restaurant and hotel workers being added on. We saw workers in supermarket being added on. Part of that reflects the settlement of the grocery stores strike out California. We saw workers in the health care sector and hospitals being added on. We saw business services adding employees. So in general, with the very important exception of manufacturing, we are seeing job growth across all of these different types of occupations.",

You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ... Brandon: But, she might blow up. Stacy: She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ... Brandon: I just don't know. Stacy: I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger.

M: So if the caretaker is a person, the crane will stay in places where people are. W: Yeah. And their chances for survival aren't very good. But by covering ourselves and using cloth and puppets the chicks are more likely to seek out other birds rather than people. And their transition to the wild has a better chance of being successful.

M: You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen. W: Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now. M: Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment. W: Such as...? M: There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives. W: What needs to be done? M: Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries. W: So you are hopeful for the future. M: As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job.

No. It can't stop some, people from seeing the world in twisted ways. It can't stop some people from hurting themselves. W: What kind of people do you have difficulty working with? M: I'm naturally a person who likes to be decisive, and to act, so I get impatient sometimes when I'm working with a large group.

Then I wrote about restaurants for the Swedish club magazine and someone suggested I gather the information about the restaurants together since I had all the facts about the restaurants I've been to. I started to do that. Woman: How do you find restaurants? Man: The best way is to ask the people there. I may talk to the people at the street market or take a walk and look for a place for myself.

It is difficult for two people of entirely different religions to live and share life together. They will face so many problems that it would be better if they don't get married in the first place. M: Of course there will be problems. Even two people of the same religion have problems. It is the same in this case. except that it will be slightly more difficult, I guess. W: I agree with you, Henry. Naturally, there will be arguments and personal differences. Marriage thrives on a give-and-take policy, so a couple will have to learn to adapt to each other's customs and traditions. M: That's right. Married people should be more tolerant towards each other and be willing to learn about each other's religion. Only then can understanding and acceptance be achieved ultimately. W: You talk as if it were very simple. It isn't, you know. I should know. as I am a child of a mixed marriage. M: All right, you tell us why is is not such a good idea. W: You see, Henry, it depends on the individuals concerned. If two people of different religions marry, they should be prepared for the consequences. It is only after marriage that the vast differences in the cultures begin to show. Little things, from food and clothes to bigger aspects like religious beliefs, tend to clash, leading eventually to a rift. Besides. there will be either personal pride or the reluctance to accept the other's views. It may lead to a big gap between the parents, and their children may suffer a lot in between.

Mathew: Well, the first thing is driving on the wrong side of the road..., that would be the- that was very strange because you have this automatic reflex when you go out into the street to look one way and a couple of times I did that and I almost got hit by cars and bikes and all, you know. It's dangerous. It really is dangerous. And you have to teach yourself to look the other way. Interviewer: Someone said that Britain and the United States are divided by a common language. Have you had any difficulties with the language here? Mathew: Oh, yeah-tremendous amount of difficulty but I'm starting to pick it up now-all the lingo and slang and all those-but there's definitely a difference. Interviewer: Can you give me any example? Mathew: Well, the big-I'd say some of the biggest ones would be the word \"queue\" which means in America \"line\". I never heard the word \"queue\" before. Um-what you call \"chips\", I call \"French fries\". I never heard them called \"chips\". Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different. Ah-\" crisps\" which mean \" potato chips\" Yeah, that's - we call them \"potato chips\" or \"chips\" in America. You call them \"crisps\" here. So when I heard the word \"chips\", I was thinking of \"crisps\" and not French fry-you know-it's very confusing but-urn-but just some of the expressions like-er-\" mate\" you know and \"love\". Those-you know--they're funny. You don't hear them. You don't hear them in America. Interviewer: What about with young people-with people your own age-I mean, do you notice differences there? Mathew: I do notice some differences-er-I think-ah-I think the younger people in Britain are-they seem to be-much more radical than the younger people in the United States. I noticed that. Ah-the dress is different. You see a lot of-I see a lot of males here with earring in one of their-in one of their ears. You don't see that in America that much. Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women. Interviewer: You don't like that? Mathew: Not really. It's just my own preference. I like-I'd rather see different colors here and there-not all-not all one color. Everyone looks like Madonna. Interviewer: When you say \"radical\"-do you-are you just thinking of clothes or of anything else? Mathew: Um-no, I think-er-radical as in going against the norms-could you say? Not only in clothing but I think in politics too whereas in America-er-you don't find that as much. Oh, also, another difference is the young-er-the younger people are-they're more politically aware on a larger level. See a lot of the-a lot of the Americans- they're aware of-er-government of the United States and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in Europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run-not as widespread. Whereas here, I think that they- er-the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the United States and how it's run. Interviewer: What do you think the reasons are for that? Mathew: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run. And so many of our policies in America affect Britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn't work on the other level like Britain's policies don't-I mean, they can affect us, but not to as great an extent and therefore you don't hear as much about Britain and people don't know as much about it.",

W: That's right. Well, the report basically look into the various beliefs that people hold about old age and tries to prove them. M: And what do you think your report can achieve? W: We hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age. The problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor, lonely, and unhappy. As a result, we tend to find old people, as a group, unattractive. And this is very dangerous for our society. M: But surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick. W: No, we can't. But we must also remember that the proportion of such people is no greater among the 60-70 age group than among the 50-60 age group. M: In other words, there is no more mental illness, for example, among the 60s-70s than among the 50s-60s. W: Right! M: Are people's mental abilities affected by old age? W: Certain changes do take place as we grow older, but this happens throughout life. These changes are very gradual and happen at different times with different people, but, in general, if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems, you will easily recognize him in an old age. M: So that someone who enjoys new experiences, travel, education, and so on in his middle years will usually continue to do so into old age? W: Exactly.",

My leg still hurts from the last incident. Norman: Hey, he's just a playful little beast. Shawn: Right. Norman: Hey, he likes to bark a little, and his bark is worse than his bite. Shawn: Oh yeah. Norman: Just feed him a can of dog food a day, and make sure he has plenty of water in his dish. [Oh] And then, take him for a walk around the block. Shawn: Well, how about if I just throw a Frisbee over the fence to give him some exercise? Wouldn't that work? Norman: Ah, and then, he likes to watch the 3:00 soap opera on Channel 4 [What?] ... and brush his teeth after you give you some doggie treats around 4:00. Shawn: Man, you really pamper your dog. Norman: And, then brush his fur for about twenty minutes. He tends to shed this time of year. [Ah, what?] And then scratch him around the ears. Otherwise, he feels neglected. Shawn: Is that it? Norman: Well, and then there's Claws. Shawn: Claws? Who's Claws. Norman: Oh, he's the cat we adopted from the animal shelter, but he's a little temperamental. Shawn: What do you mean \"temperamental\"? Norman: Well, he has mood swings [Mood swings?], but he's been doing better since he's been going to the animal therapist. Shawn: A therapist? Norman: So, be sure to feed him a half cup of cat food two times a day [What? A therapist ...], and don't forget to put out (on) some soft classical music during his nap time at 2:40 p.m. But don't let him out of the house because he might run away and chase the neighbor's dog. Shawn: You have some high-maintenance animals. Norman: Not really. And, don't forget to change the cat litter daily, or he might have an accident on the carpet. [Oh, great.] And finally, there's Buttercup. Shawn: Buttercup? Who's Buttercu ...? I'm afraid to ask. Norman: Ah, she's a sweetie [What?] ... if you know how to handle her right. [Oh, great.] Wait. Let me get her for you. Here you are. Shawn: That's ... That's a snake ...[Hold her.] That's a big snake with big fangs. Does the snake go to a therapist, too? Norman: Of course not ... just an anger-management class. Shawn: Oh! What? Norman: I'm joking. Buttercup is a very docile creature, and she never bites anyone she likes. If she doesn't, you'll know because she starts hissing and staring at you ... kind like what she's doing now. Shawn: Well, I'm leaving.

If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish. M: Sounds terribly complicated. W: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn't actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light. M: So did it work?

Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for. F: Where are the jobs? M: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg. F: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place. M: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias. F: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends! M: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high. F: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me. F: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays. M: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares. F: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain? M: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now. F: And what about accommodation? M: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think. F: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities? M: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center. F: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for? M: I think a maximum of five years. I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too! F: So we'd be there long enough to enable John to complete a university course. M: Well, yes we would, unless of course he preferred to go to a university in the UK. But, yes, if he did want to go to university in Germany, there'd be no problem as each of those cities have their own universities. Munich, in fact, has the second largest university in Germany. F: Well, it seems to me the choice must be between Hamburg and Munch. Hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to Britain, so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive. Munich, on the other hand, sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view. M: I agree with you. Personally, I favor Munich because it's so near to the Alps. We all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter. F: I think you're right. I had thought Hamburg might be preferable because it's the closest to Britain. But we'll only be abroad for five years, and if we're going to be away, let's choose the most attractive place we can. M: Right. That's agreed. Now all I have to do is get the job!",

Vet, what was life like for you as a child? Vet: Life was fun. I was always very loved, even without my father around. I was somewhat of a troublemaker, but I have a lot of good memories to show for it. Being a child was the best time of my life. Crystal: How have your childhood years affected who you are today? Vet: I was raised by very strong, supportive people. My mother and sisters have a lot to do with who I am. I also learned many lessons, good and bad, which have made me a strong adult. They have helped me realize what I need to do to be happy. My mother has always been the best person in my life. She has never let me down, and has always been very supportive. Whenever I needed a friend, she was one. My sisters have also been there for me. When my morn was getting her college degree, she would be out late, and my sisters stepped in and played morn. They are my best friends and give me great advice. Crystal: What have been some of your biggest trials, and how have you overcome them? Vet: The biggest trial in my life was when I got pregnant sophomore year. It was a new road to travel. I didn't have to get over it, I had to accept it and learn to adapt. Another trial would be trying to get over the love of my life, my baby's father. We were engaged, but things went the other way. I had to learn to love myself more than I loved a man. Crystal: Who helped you during your pregnancy? Vet: My morn and sisters were everything I needed them to be-a mother, sister, boyfriend, best friend and father. All my friends were there for me, I could cry to them whenever I needed to. I'm especially thankful for my morn. It was hard for her to deal with two pregnant children at the same time. The dad and his family were also there, which was a blessing Crystal: When a bad situation comes up, what do you do? Vet: I try to find the best way to deal with it. I am often faced with issues in my school about my race. It is not easy to keep your temper, but you have to try to understand why people are upset and angry. I try to find a way out without hurting anyone, or. myself. Crystal: How has being so small and pregnant affected your body? Vet: It has worn me out. My body is stretched in places I never knew I had. My hips are huge, I won't be a model again anytime soon. Being pregnant so young has emotionally drained me. I have so many things to worry about now, and my emotions are like a roller coaster. One minute I am happy, and the next depressed. I never spend time on my appearance.

Mr. Dong: I'm a language teacher at the Jiaotong University in Shanghai. This university keeps up close relations with some British universities, among which is Oxford University. My university and Oxford have an exchange program. Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong. They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures, staying only a few weeks. The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month. It is all the money I have to cover all my expenses. Although I do not have much money, I'm still happy that I have the opportunity to study in Britain. Being an English teacher in China, I, of course, do not have to pass the IELTS. Delia Robinson: Finally we want to introduce Mr. Yuan, who is financing his studies out of his own pocket. He wants to graduate in Oxford. Mr. Yuan: Neither the Chinese nor the British government is financially supporting me. My parents paid me the flight from Beijing to London. In Britain I have relatives that came to Dover via Hong Kong about ten years ago. They give me 500 pounds each month. That is of course not enough to survive. So I get a part-time job in a Chinese restaurant and earn about 400 or 500 pounds per month. I also had to pass the IELTS in order to study at a British University. Delia Robinson: Thank you, Mr. Yuan. Wang, Zhu, Dong and Yuan, four different people and their different ways of financing their studies in Great Britain. In our next edition of Overseas Students at British Universities we will talk about students from the Far East. Until then. Goodbye.",

Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay. Caller: And what's your name? Apartment Owner: It's Norman. Norman Bates. Caller: Alright, Mr. Bates. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Apartment Owner: Bye.",

Urn... we employ about two thousand people in all in two different locations. Most people work here at our headquarters plant. And this is where we have the administrative departments, of course. Presenter: Perhaps you could say something about the departmental structure? John Knox: Yes, certainly. Urn.., now.., er... first of all we've got four main divisions. There's the production division which, as the name suggests, is responsible for production operations. And as you know we've got two factories, er... one here in Bath, UK, and the other in Lille, France. Er... Philippe Rochard is the other General Manager, there in Lille. Presenter: And you're completely independent of each other, is that right? John Knox: Oh, yes, yes. Our... our two plants are fairly independent. I mean, I... am responsible to Bill Williamson, the Production Manager, and we have to cooperate closely with.., with Helga Meier, the Marketing Manager. Presenter: Mm. John Knox: But otherwise, as far as day-to-day running is concerned, we're pretty much left alone to get on with the job. Haha. Oh, and I forgot to mention the most important division of all, some people say. That's finance. Er... the Financial Director is Fred Rasmussen. He's a very important man. And his task is to make sure the money-side of things is OK. The accountant and such people, they report to him directly. Presenter: Is that all? Um. John Knox: Oh, no, no, no, no. There's personnel. Presenter: Yes. John Knox: That's quite separate. David Hopper is Personnel Manager. And the Training Manager reports to him of course. Presenter: But I imagine that a firm such as your own has smaller departments within the divisions? John Knox: Oh yes, that's the case, yes. I mentioned that we are fairly independent. Presenter: What about Research and Development? Isn't that a separate department? John Knox: Well, in terms of the laboratories, there are.., there are two er... one at each production plant. But it's a department in the production division and it has a single head. And that's Piet Van De Geer. Presenter: Are there any other features worth mentioning? John Knox: Well, if we take our division, which of course I know best, we've got several other departments, which all report, as I said, to Bill Williamson and which I am responsible for on this site. Er... now there's the..., er..., planning department. Ray Wood is in charge of that. And a purchasing department er... they buy in the materials for production. Presenter: Yes, and what about the board of directors and the chairman? John Knox: Yes, well, they're at the top, aren't they, of course? I...

Caller: Alright. What is the tuition for a full-time student? Receptionist: It's two thousand thirty dollars. Caller: And how does one apply? Receptionist: Well, we can send you an application and you can mail it back to us, or you can fill out our application that's online at our Web site.

It seems to me that some of the spellings are different. M: Such as? W: Words like theater and center end in \"re\" in England instead of \"er\" like we spell them. M: Can you think of any more examples? W: The word \"color\" is another case in point. In fact, many words which end in \"or\" in American English are spelled \"our\" in British English. M: I'm still not convinced. I mean, if someone comes here from England, we can all understand what he's saying. The spelling doesn't really matter that much. W: We're not just talking about spelling. There are differences in pronunciation and meaning too. I remember seeing an English movie where the actors kept calling their apartment a flat. Half of the movie was over before I realized what they were talking about. M: So there are slight differences in spelling and some vocabulary. W: And in pronunciation, too. You aren't going to tell me that you sound like James Simpson. M: James Simpson isn't English. He's Scottish. W: Okay. Anyway, the pronunciation is different. M: So British English and American English are different in many ways, right? W: Yes, sure. M: But it's not so different that it prevents us from understanding each other.

M: He was born in Indiana in 1931, but his parents moved to California when he was five. He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt. W: So how did he get into acting? M: Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting. W: Then when did his movie career really start? M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society. W: So how many more movies did he make? M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today? M: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies. Many young people saw him as a symbol of American youths.",

M: That's \u00a3100, about $160. W: What about the accommodation that goes with that trip? M: Well, that is inclusive. It means... It's a three-star hotel, which is pretty good quality, right in the center of town. We've had a lot of customers who've stayed there and they have been perfectly happy. Er, it is what we call bed and breakfast though. Would that be all right? W: Oh, that would suit me fine, because I'd like to try some of that Scottish food, that haggis, whatever it is... so... so... that... M: Of course, so when would you like to go? This 3-day trip by train is only available in mid-week. That would be Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Would that suit you? W: Wonderful. M: All right.",

Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose.

I've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with. W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"? M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop. We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible. M: Well, people may think differently of your methods, but there's no doubt you're doing a great job. Keep it up and good luck.

M: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him. W: About what time would you think that they were there? M: Just after half past one to a quarter past two. W: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes. M: In fact, yes, as short as that. W: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club? M: Fifty meters. W: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time? M: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way.

But the villages I stayed in had much in common- poverty, dirt, and ignorance. W: But in spite of all this, you still feel very happy. Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States? M: Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon? Guest: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US. dragonProgram Host: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet? Guest: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures. Program Host: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly. Guest: You just need to know how to care for them. Program Host: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind? Guest: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ... Program Host: Like, like a cage or something like that. Guest: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage. Program Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that. greensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores... Program Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that? Guest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems. Program Host: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay. Guest: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth. Program Host: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that? Guest: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. Guest: [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy? baskGuest: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb ... Program Host: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay. Guest: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process. Program Host: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area? Guest: Like ninety to a hundred degrees. Program Host: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No]. Program Host: Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work? Guest: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need. Program Host: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua. Guest: My pleasure.",

Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year.
