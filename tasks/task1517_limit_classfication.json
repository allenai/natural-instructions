    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a sentence and your task is to identify whether the sentence contains motion or not, by classifying the sentence into Yes or No. The sentence belongs to the 'Yes' category if there is an occurrence of a motion of a physical entity otherwise the sentence belongs to the 'No' category.
