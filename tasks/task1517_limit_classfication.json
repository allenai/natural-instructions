    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a sentence and your task is to identify whether the sentence contains motion or not, by classifying the sentence into Yes or No. The sentence belongs to the 'Yes' category if there is an occurrence of a motion of a physical entity otherwise the sentence belongs to the 'No' category. The sentence contains motion if it (i) involves the movement of a physical object. (ii) contains verb in present tense indicating the action performed. Sometimes there can be verb which indicates a motion but the motion might have happened in the past and the answers to such sentences is 'No'",
