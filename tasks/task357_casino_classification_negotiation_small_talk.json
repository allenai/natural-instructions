    "Definition": "The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent. For example, discussing how the opponent is doing during the pandemic or sharing excitement for the camping trip.",
    "Positive Examples": [

I think that will work out for me.  You get 3 water, 1 wood and 1 food.  I will take the rest.'\nUtterance: 'Great that's an agreement for me'",
            "output": "No",
