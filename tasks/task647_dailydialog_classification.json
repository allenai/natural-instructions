That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ?  We have half-hour and one-hour treatments .  What's the regular price ?  Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do .  Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up .

Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .  But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .  Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .  I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .  Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?  It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?  Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .  Why ?  That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .  It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet .
