    "Definition": [
        "In this task, given 2 input sentences, you must classify the relation between them. If the second sentence has a similar meaning to that of the first sentence then the output is ' B_entails_A', if the second sentence has the opposite meaning to the first sentence then it is classified as ' B_contradicts_A'. If you cannot clearly ascertain agreement/disagreement between the two sentences, the label is ' B_neutral_A'."
