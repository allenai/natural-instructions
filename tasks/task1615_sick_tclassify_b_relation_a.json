    "Definition": "In this task, given 2 input sentences, you must classify the relation between them. If the second sentence has a similar meaning to that of the first sentence then the output is ' B_entails_A', if the second sentence has the opposite meaning to the first sentence then it is classified as ' B_contradicts_A'. If you cannot clearly ascertain agreement/disagreement between the two sentences, the label is ' B_neutral_A'.",

            "output": "B_contradicts_A",
            "explanation": "The sentence B has opposite meaning as sentence_B says, \"No man with a hat\", but sentence_A says, \"A man is wearing a hat\", so B is contradicting A."

            "input": "sentence_A: A baby is crying. sentence_B: A man is exercising.",
            "output": "B_neutral_A",
