Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

Use a substitute if you have an aversion - honey, agave, raw cane sugar, whatever you prefer. (Of course, anything liquid is going to contain some water, and cause a bit of ice, but it's still doable.) A sorbet without any extra sugar, even when frozen normally in an ice cream maker, is going to end up with a very icy texture, which will probably keep you from experiencing the flavor as much. The sugar helps soften it.The other common way to soften a sorbet is alcohol. RosÃ© wine (thank you, David Lebovitz) works quite well in a strawberry sorbet. Vodka can be your go-to liquor for any impromptu sorbet with other fruits, since it'll add alcohol without any flavors that clash. Beyond that, either look for recipes, or look for mixed drinks containing the fruit you're using.You might also be having problems simply because your strawberries aren't that great. Did you freeze them, or were they storebought? If you bought the strawberries yourself, you'd know they were decent before freezing, while not all storebought frozen fruit is as flavorful.Finally, it's possible that your frozen strawberries collected some extra water in the form of frost, which then makes your sorbet icier.

On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products.

I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did.

Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle.

This, he claims, is because the sourdough yeast cultivates a culture of friendly bacteria and an acid environment, all of which become natural preservatives. My experience seems to confirm this.Bread recipes containing egg, oil or milk tend to keep for longer than those without.As @SAJ14SAJ says, bread freezes very well. Loss of flavour in the freezer is not a commonly recognised phenomenon.One option is to slice a loaf of bread, bag it and freeze it. Take as many slices as you need at a time. It will defrost very quickly at room temperature, due to its low mass and high surface area.Another option is to make rolls, part-bake, and freeze. When you need them, take as many rolls as you need from the freezer, and place in the oven, to both defrost and complete the baking. You will get fresh baking smells and flavours from this.I suspect that home-made unleavened breads (pita, chapati, tortilla), without added preservatives, will not last long out of the freezer.

On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products.

This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5\" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want.

And in a non-urban world, salt/sodium is a valuable nutrient; the fact we might have it too readily available in the developed world doesn't change that we would DIE on a zero-sodium diet (mind that animal products like meat aren't zero-sodium, and that herbivores tend to love licking salt where they find it!). So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food?

Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops.

On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products.

It's not red in color because it doesn't have any significant amount of dried red chile in it--it gets whatever heat and chile flavor it has from green chile, which doesn't color the stew significantly.As to defining chili, I think you could work on a definition forever. Apart from the notion that a chile is the pepper, which is the main ingredient, and chili is the dish, I don't like to define it too carefully (of course, New Mexicans think the dish is chile too, but what they have is different from Texas chili, even when they use red chiles). I think chili is a stew, though. Most stew isn't chili, but all chili is stew. And I believe that for most people to accept what you're making as chili, it would have to include a significant dose of dried red chile powder.So if you can accept the validity of white chili at all, and what you're making has almost all green chiles and very little red chile, then I'd say you're making a white chili.

For polyalcohols, you can look up their masses easily.I would still advise against using this sort of tool alone for icecream making.Separately, sweetness is less about just dry mass but molar concentration, which is why inverted syrup is sweeter than sucrose, 1 unit of sucrose in the same amount of water is less sweet than if it was broken into their constituent mono-saccharide glucose and fructose; instead of 1 unit of sucrose, you have 1 unit of glucose and 1 unit of fructose, double the concentration.  <sep>  Q: what impact does a sugar have on ice cream?",

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

There are a couple of drawbacks you might want to take into account when making your recipe, though.One is that the individual tastes of the ingredients all meld together when the frittata gets thawed or reheated, so if you're looking forward to that bite that has a particularly strong taste of, say, asparagus, it's not going to happen. Conversely, if you're looking forward to that bite that doesn't include the taste of green pepper, that's not going to happen, either, if you put it in there. I never use green pepper in frittata; it completely takes over the dish.The other drawback is that some of the moister ingredients will lose water upon thawing or reheating, thus soaking the frittata on the second go-around and giving it an unpleasant, rubbery texture.

This may give your bread a more grainy texture (not a bad thing), and makes atta unideal for cakes, biscuits, and quick breads unless you like them with a coarse texture in the crumb.

I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier.

If the cheese was acidified with a bacterial inoculation then the bacteria will have converted some of the lactose into lactic acid which will both be in the whey. Riboflavin is water soluble and is what gives the whey that greenish tint.Either way- most of the nutrients that bacteria like are not in the whey and it is always highly acidic.

Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

This is why when pan-frying a steak, you know it's close to medium rare once you see the juices start to come through the top. The fat in burgers does the same thing, it moves away from the heat source, and back into the rest of the meat. That's just what happens when meat cooks and constricts. Many fast food joints use a double grill (you pull an inverted flat top down on top of the burger on the flat top). Whoops, there goes practically everything moist in the 3 or so minutes they cook them.Using steam, you make this a much gentler process.

Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation.

Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough.

So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to \"play it by ear\".

Second, take a small pot, and fill it with just one portion of soup per eater. Put it on the heat, and cook until the noodles are done. (Alternatively, put the single portions into porcelain bowls and microwave until the noodles are ready - it spares you washing an additional pot, but I wouldn't nuke a good soup for no reason). Third, eat your cooked soup portions and let the big pot of soup slowly cool on its own. Fourth, freeze the soup from the big pot. Finis.

In other words, a large roast will have a greater thermal mass â more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature, and the heat will transfer into the coolest point, raising its ultimate temperature.So, the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained. To err on the side of food safety, keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature. With a little experience, you'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts, and remove it from the oven earlier.The bottom line however, is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature.  <sep>  Q: In what stage should the temperature of meat be taken?

Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying?

Soaking should be done in the fridge, for a few hours.You could go for a tomato-based sauce, a curry using coconut milk, or a sticky orange and chilli sauce, so long as the ratio of beef to everything else (and beef to initial liquid) is small. The initial liquid shouldn't bring any more salt with it, which rules out most cmmercial stock preparations, and possbile home-made stock. These are just ideas, many beef in sauce dishes would adapt.

Usually, Marinades, Pestos etc. that use mashed onions and/or garlic taste best if they are made the way the name \"Pesto\" suggests: Cutting stuff very fine, then using a mortar and pestle. Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

So \"leaving out\" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat.

In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter).

As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton. Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry?

Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops.

When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good. If it is fruit, the holes are purely a cosmetic problem.

You might well be able to kill off germs in things that aren't outright spoiled. Pizza isn't that long-cooking, so there's risk there.Ultimately, you have to be the arbiter of safety. Check the USDA website about food safety and follow every rule if you want to feel certain.  <sep>  Q: I left homemade pizza out overnight, is it still good?",

Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough. So, a dough with 100 g water and 100 g butter will be extremely different from a dough with 117 g of water, and still pretty different from one with 117 g of water and 83 g of oil. So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to \"play it by ear\". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were \"hydration\", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as \"hydration\" when figuring Dough Hydration?

In addition, it is often spiced with cardamom, and often sweetened with sugar.Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot.

            "input": "CONTEXT: To clarify: forced-air (a/k/a \"convection\", a/k/a \"fan bake\") ovens rely on a fan to circulate the air in the oven. The fast-moving air substantially enhances the rate at which heat is transferred to the food. It is particularly good where you want the surface to brown, such as roasts and breads; it is not as good for more delicate items, such as custards and cakes, which can set too quickly or get dried out. For cookies, it depends on what effect you want, but many standard types do well in forced-air ovens because the fan helps ensure that the whole oven stays at a uniform temperature despite the presence of several trays. (Of course, the tray closest to the heating element will still cook faster than the one farthest away, so you will still have to swap them partway through.)The general rule for using the fan is to set the oven temperature 25 degrees F (15 C) lower than what the recipe calls for using in a regular oven. Even then, don't go strictly by cooking time, as ovens vary; rather, be sure to check on your food regularly to see how fast it is cooking. You may need to cover your food to prevent over-browning, or perhaps adjust the oven temperature.  <sep>  Q: Is it better to use a fan when baking ?

This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5\" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

With a Filipino Lechon, it's served communally and eaten as pulled pork, so it's expected that you'll just plunk it down on a side table, and people will crack through the crisp, almost hard, skin and pull servings for themselves with tongs or forks. And they'll go for the whole thing, skin, ears, jowls and all (most people I know don't eat the ears, but they may crunch the crispy skin off them).A similar thing is done with a country-style hog roast. Those may be skinned before serving, but generally you're responsible for pulling or slicing what you want right off the hog (and usually throwing it on a cheapo burger bun). In both of these settings there are almost always some people who don't want to dig right into the pig out of squeamishness or out of fear of getting some part that's not nice to eat.

The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6\" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great.

You don't want them to dry out, and yet you don't want them too wet or they will get slimy and disgusting.What works best for me is remove any binding holding them together (e.g. rubber band or twisty-tie), (and certainly trim off any parts of the scallions that are already damaged and/or slimy), don't wash until you are ready to use them, wrap the bunch of scallions loosely (but completely covered) in a paper towel, and then store that wrapped bundle in a flimsy plastic bag (maybe the one you brought them home from the supermarket in) in your refrigerator. Sounds \"fussy\" when you lay out all the steps like that, but really, it's not a whole lot of work. Removing the rubber band etc. prevents damage where it would cut into the veg. flesh, paper towel absorbs condensation & liquid water which will rot the scallions (paper towel will prob. become slightly damp after a while in the fridge, but this is OK), plastic bag prevents evaporation of moist air.I find this works well for lots of greens, esp. cilantro - the worst offender in the demanding vegetables category.P.S.

And in a non-urban world, salt/sodium is a valuable nutrient; the fact we might have it too readily available in the developed world doesn't change that we would DIE on a zero-sodium diet (mind that animal products like meat aren't zero-sodium, and that herbivores tend to love licking salt where they find it!). So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food? A: Our brains are wired to consider food more palatable if the dedicated taste receptors (one of the six basic tastes) for salt are triggered  Q: What else does salt do?

If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did.

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier.

While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it \"the lump\". What I think happens is that the lump is too heavy. When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good.

This, he claims, is because the sourdough yeast cultivates a culture of friendly bacteria and an acid environment, all of which become natural preservatives. My experience seems to confirm this.Bread recipes containing egg, oil or milk tend to keep for longer than those without.As @SAJ14SAJ says, bread freezes very well. Loss of flavour in the freezer is not a commonly recognised phenomenon.One option is to slice a loaf of bread, bag it and freeze it. Take as many slices as you need at a time. It will defrost very quickly at room temperature, due to its low mass and high surface area.Another option is to make rolls, part-bake, and freeze. When you need them, take as many rolls as you need from the freezer, and place in the oven, to both defrost and complete the baking.

I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier.

So \"leaving out\" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat. Pieces of fried meat left over in the fat are a safety risk, even tiny ones.  <sep>  Q: How long does grease take to go bad/rancid when sitting out?

I would personally go for the opposite effect and add a small amount of lemon juice to the raspberry puree to give a little tartness to complement the sweetness of the marshmallow.As far as the chocolate, I would recommend a darker chocolate. 55% is quite sweet, especially around a marshmallow.

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

However, if you don't have one my suggestion for pan-frying something like breaded fish would be to pull the fish through the oil puddle with your fingers or tongs as you put it in and then let the fish sit on the non-oily part of the pan. Repeat that for all the pieces. I think what you'll find doing that though is that the breading will soak up all the oil, and you'll need to add some more in anyway in order to have enough to coat the other side when you turn the fish over. Adding more oil will cool the pan and you won't get as good as a result, so it's counter-productive. You're better off adding more oil at the beginning.

Since the muscle fibres are already toughened at that temperature, there is no reason to hold it low; you can put it at full boil in a normal pot and cook it there, you just have to wait long enough.

A slow simmer maximum is required to retain all the desired qualities. Hence the saying \"low and slow\" which I take quite literally band apply to just about everything culinary wise. From cooking stew to proving bread, the longer the better. Edit:I wrote that then went in the shower and remembered pasta & potatoes, so maybe low and slow unless it's a starchy carbohydrate.

I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier.

The mix up method breaks up the strands of meat which come out of the grinder which makes patties more fragile, however flavorings are distributed evenly. Some people add binding agents like egg and breadcrumbs to hold it together when using the mix up method in which case it becomes more of a flat meatball than a burger.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a \"normal\" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding.

But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired.

Making the stock without vegetables in it will give you a clear broth with a simple pork flavor and the vegetables will be distinct in it. If you add vegetables while cooking the stock and then puree them in your base will be much more vegetable-y, and opaque - the color will be determined by the vegetables added. The pork taste will be a bit more hidden by vegetable flavors. Spices and herbs are 2 separate matters. In general you can overcook herbs very easily but it's hard to overcook spices (although some spices can change during long cooking times). Adding bay (laurel) is one of the exceptions herb-wise. Spice-wise adding at the beginning will make the spice permeate the meat, careful not to overdo it though.Like I said it's all about the look and taste you want.  <sep>  Q: Should I add vegetables and spices in the stock-making stage of pig-knuckle soup?

Doing it in the oven won't be any faster or less boring than steaming it - it may even be slower, since heat transfer from steam is pretty efficient. 45 minutes at 120Â°C would probably leave it undercooked, and if you cook at a higher temperature, you'll be missing the point - steaming for a long time lets it cook slowly and more evenly. You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a \"normal\" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding. Then you can increase the temperature of the oven, perhaps to 150-175Â°C, without overheating the pudding. But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired.

Safe preservation recipes have either been extensively tested in a lab, or used for centuries. Making a small change can destroy the delicate balance which leads to a tasty, safe food. The solution here is to look for another recipe, one which is safe but does not contain wine. For something as risky as cured meat, I'd suggest not getting some random recipe off the Internet, but choosing from a book, or maybe from the blog of a known, respectable author.

These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway.

If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did.

Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as \"covering with a lot of oil.\"As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much.

Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: When I cook my meat, I usually bake or broil it, I basically use the oven.

Many fast food joints use a double grill (you pull an inverted flat top down on top of the burger on the flat top). Whoops, there goes practically everything moist in the 3 or so minutes they cook them.Using steam, you make this a much gentler process.

Keeping something under a lid and refrigerated restricts the number of airborne colonizers that might get access to it, and the cold temperature means that even if they get there, they will grow much slower than at room temperature.For something to spoil, it needs to be colonized by bacteria or fungus spores, and it needs to contain some nourishment to support their growth, not too much chemicals that prevent their growth, and not too much competing life forms already present. So, things with a high concentration of salt or sugar tend to be unhospitable to bacteria and fungi growth, because they are hygroscopic (they draw the water out of cells). Extreme high or low pH (eg acidic) also retards growth. Think of things like ketchup, mustard, jelly with labels that say \"refrigerate after opening\" but most people ignore them. Alcohol is unfriendly if the concentration is too high, and of course natural fermented foods are already occupied by human-friendly bacteria.Ketchup is sealed in a bottle, usually with no fingers or utensils inserted into it, so it stays pretty sterile. It is also protected by being hygroscopic (due to high concentration of sugar and salt) and its acidity.

For something like a beef or pork roast, the coolest point will be generally in the very center of the roast. For chicken or turkey, it will often be where the leg joins the body. You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading.Now, because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature, the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven. How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is. In other words, a large roast will have a greater thermal mass â more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature, and the heat will transfer into the coolest point, raising its ultimate temperature.So, the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained. To err on the side of food safety, keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature. With a little experience, you'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts, and remove it from the oven earlier.The bottom line however, is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature.  <sep>  Q: In what stage should the temperature of meat be taken?

When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good.

This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5\" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it \"the lump\". What I think happens is that the lump is too heavy. When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good.

As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton.

This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry?

So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food?

As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton. Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry?

This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry.

Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier.

Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic. If it stinks, throw it out. Before that, there is no problem eating it. The above assumes pure, well-strained fat.

I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16\" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6\" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great.

In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs - made of only flour, water, yeast and salt, eventually preferments or later mixins like seeds. You can extend it to enriched doughs (those that have fat, milk, eggs, tomato juice, etc.) but then it is no longer sharply defined. Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough. So, a dough with 100 g water and 100 g butter will be extremely different from a dough with 117 g of water, and still pretty different from one with 117 g of water and 83 g of oil. So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to \"play it by ear\". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were \"hydration\", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as \"hydration\" when figuring Dough Hydration?

You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation.

This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5\" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weâve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handâs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donât matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as âexperienceâ. I personally donât think in âdegreesâ though, but more in categories like âtoo coldâ / âshould be okâ / âtoo hotâ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops. And sometimes the exact temperature is not important for a recipe to work.Using the X-time at Y-distance formula may work, if your heat sensitivity is similar to the authorâs.  <sep>  Q: How accurate is the hand technique for grilling?

I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16\" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6\" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great. I'd still cut the leaves into ribbons, just because it's easier to eat than a huge intact leaf.I'd assume that the leaves would cook at a similar rate as spinich, and the ribs closer to fennel, if that helps at all.  <sep>  Q: How should I prepare Bok Choy before I cook it?

My experience, taken from memory, follows:Turkish coffee goes through a sequence of mouth feels, from completely clear, to grainy, almost muddy, with coffee grounds. This also affects the flavour of the coffee. At the beginning, it is much like a strong filter brew, but tends to get bitter towards the end of the cup, which is also, in part, why it is traditionally served in very small cups. In addition, it is often spiced with cardamom, and often sweetened with sugar.Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot.

Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle.

It is designed to produce a consistent one for taste testing, so that no tea manufacturer can claim that his tea wasn't made \"properly\".It's title is \"Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests\"As for the actual tea making, yes, leaving the bag in longer will make a stronger cup of tea. The concentration of caffeine (along with flavour molecules and everything else) will slowly trend towards an equal concentration in the leaf and in the water. The longer you leave the tea bag/leaves in the water, the closer to equilibrium you will get.There are other factors that affect this, such as the temperature of the water, cut of the leaves, bag versus loose leaf and so on, but the trend is always towards equilibrium as time progresses.I'm not sure where the upper limit of this lies, but I think that once the cup is cold there's no point in it anyway. Thus, leaving the bag in for an hour is a bit much. I usually steep my tea for 3-6 minutes, depending on how strong I want it to be.  <sep>  Q: Does brewing tea for longer result in higher caffeine content?",

            "input": "CONTEXT: The main purpose of beating an egg is to \"denature\" the protein within the egg. Proteins are long chains of amino acids and they have lots of internal chemical bonds, which hold them together into tightly contained units. When a protein is denatured, those internal bonds break and the amino acid chains unravel and become elongated. At the same time, atoms that were previously bonded (as part of the internal bonds I mentioned) become available to bond with other molecules. When an egg is heated to 40 degrees celsius, its protein chains become denatured and elongate, which allows chemical reactions to occur. The egg changes from a liquid solution of protein into a solid mass.A similar thing happens with you beat an egg. The physical act of beating causes the protein strands to stretch, thereby causing the protein to denature (the internal bonds are broken as a result of the application of physical force). So, rather than the protein chains being bound up into tight balls, they become long strands. This is similar to gluten when it is developed. These strands form structures that allow the trapping of air, which results in a lighter texture. Beating eggs is not just about mixing. It's about changing the structure of the eggs to produce a physical effect.

Whoops, there goes practically everything moist in the 3 or so minutes they cook them.Using steam, you make this a much gentler process.

This, he claims, is because the sourdough yeast cultivates a culture of friendly bacteria and an acid environment, all of which become natural preservatives. My experience seems to confirm this.Bread recipes containing egg, oil or milk tend to keep for longer than those without.As @SAJ14SAJ says, bread freezes very well. Loss of flavour in the freezer is not a commonly recognised phenomenon.One option is to slice a loaf of bread, bag it and freeze it. Take as many slices as you need at a time. It will defrost very quickly at room temperature, due to its low mass and high surface area.Another option is to make rolls, part-bake, and freeze. When you need them, take as many rolls as you need from the freezer, and place in the oven, to both defrost and complete the baking. You will get fresh baking smells and flavours from this.I suspect that home-made unleavened breads (pita, chapati, tortilla), without added preservatives, will not last long out of the freezer. Their advantage is that with no rise, they are so quick to make that they can be made fresh on-demand.  <sep>  Q: What kind of homemade sandwich bread or wrap lasts longest?

It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as \"covering with a lot of oil.\"As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: When I cook my meat, I usually bake or broil it, I basically use the oven.

The longer you leave the tea bag/leaves in the water, the closer to equilibrium you will get.There are other factors that affect this, such as the temperature of the water, cut of the leaves, bag versus loose leaf and so on, but the trend is always towards equilibrium as time progresses.I'm not sure where the upper limit of this lies, but I think that once the cup is cold there's no point in it anyway. Thus, leaving the bag in for an hour is a bit much. I usually steep my tea for 3-6 minutes, depending on how strong I want it to be.  <sep>  Q: Does brewing tea for longer result in higher caffeine content?

Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough.

So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to \"play it by ear\". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were \"hydration\", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as \"hydration\" when figuring Dough Hydration?

A sorbet without any extra sugar, even when frozen normally in an ice cream maker, is going to end up with a very icy texture, which will probably keep you from experiencing the flavor as much.

Keeping something under a lid and refrigerated restricts the number of airborne colonizers that might get access to it, and the cold temperature means that even if they get there, they will grow much slower than at room temperature.For something to spoil, it needs to be colonized by bacteria or fungus spores, and it needs to contain some nourishment to support their growth, not too much chemicals that prevent their growth, and not too much competing life forms already present. So, things with a high concentration of salt or sugar tend to be unhospitable to bacteria and fungi growth, because they are hygroscopic (they draw the water out of cells). Extreme high or low pH (eg acidic) also retards growth. Think of things like ketchup, mustard, jelly with labels that say \"refrigerate after opening\" but most people ignore them. Alcohol is unfriendly if the concentration is too high, and of course natural fermented foods are already occupied by human-friendly bacteria.Ketchup is sealed in a bottle, usually with no fingers or utensils inserted into it, so it stays pretty sterile.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough.

They will be tart to very tart and even bitter, but when blended with other juices add what many people consider a very refreshing bite to the juice. Candied crabs and apple butter are commonly made with them and they can be used for jams other applications especially mixed with other apples to increase tartness.There are a wide variations of varieties, just as with full size apples, and some will seem better than other. If they are wild seedling trees rather than grafter varieties, the quality of the fruit may be hit and miss, and even some of the cultivated named varieties may be astringent, especially some which are marketed for their hard cider characteristics where the astringency is desirable.

In many cookies, the flavors will also mature and improve, especially with cocoa in the recipe.In many recipes, the cooling from refrigeration is itself part of the point--doughs may be easier to roll and cut when they are cool due to chilling of the fat. Most dietary fats are waxy, which means they don't have a single set freezing/melting point, but rather get more viscous or eventually firmer then hard as temperature drops.For example, linzer cookie dough is very frangible, and the chilling and hydration make rolling and cutting much easier.Generally, most of this affect is going to happen in the first 8 hours or so. The overnight thing is simply for convenience in most cases. In fact, 4 hours is often enough, although obviously not in your case.If the major effect is chilling in your recipe, by flattening the dough to a disk, or lengthening it to a log (thus increasing surface area) compared to a ball, it will chill more rapidly.

My experience, taken from memory, follows:Turkish coffee goes through a sequence of mouth feels, from completely clear, to grainy, almost muddy, with coffee grounds. This also affects the flavour of the coffee. At the beginning, it is much like a strong filter brew, but tends to get bitter towards the end of the cup, which is also, in part, why it is traditionally served in very small cups. In addition, it is often spiced with cardamom, and often sweetened with sugar.Coffee from a mocha pot has a consistent mouth feel all the way through the cup, as the grounds are left in the pot.

At some point, and probably within a few uses, the rapid heat cycling from the fire would cause the pizza stone to crack.Pizza stones are made from corderite or clay, sometimes with grog. This offers a smoother surface than firebrick, but that smooth surface is because of a higher amount of vitrification and less airspace in the ceramic. This means they are less resistant to cracking due thermal shock, and the fact that your pizza stone is 1/4 a thick as firebrick makes that worse.In contrast, firebrick is a standard 2.5\" thick, and made from higher-temperature materials with more airspace in the clay itself.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

How much of the albumin and lactose it loses depends on the cheese. If the milk was heated enough (190F I believe) then the albumin will denature and not be in the whey. If the cheese was acidified with a bacterial inoculation then the bacteria will have converted some of the lactose into lactic acid which will both be in the whey. Riboflavin is water soluble and is what gives the whey that greenish tint.Either way- most of the nutrients that bacteria like are not in the whey and it is always highly acidic. I have personally kept whey for a couple weeks with no ill effect.I usually use my whey soon by making ricotta. If the cheese it came from didn't denature the albumin in the milk then you can gently heat the whey until the the albumin precipitates out.

You can try substituting instant coffee 1:1, but the flavor of the baked good will certainly suffer a loss of richness. Increasing the amount of instant coffee, however, would likely add more bitter or acidic flavors -- and caffeine -- to the cookie or cake than you want. Also, instant coffee takes longer to dissolve, so it needs to be added straight to a liquid.There's no real way to substitute liquid coffee in most recipes, such as chocolate cookie or brownie recipes, because the recipe has no water in it in the first place. In the rare recipes where there is water, you could substitute strong-brewed coffee for an equal quantity of water+espresso powder, and this would likely work fairly well.So, summing up: there's no really good substitute for instant espresso powder in recipes which call for it that I've found with some significant experimentation.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

So our brains have a good evolutionary reason to like salt.Also, salt actively interferes (negatively) with another basic taste receptor - the receptor for bitterness (which can mean poison both in nature and in the developed world, or at least something we have no use for, eg an alkali). Most aromatic food (think green vegetables or spices) is bitter, and salt both attenuates that perception and balances it making the combined food still desirable for our brain. You end up with an even more palatable food since you can use an aromatic (desirable) and shut out the bitterness (not always desirable) response.Umami is a different basic taste, probably related to the presence of protein (glutamate, inosinate, guanylate... trigger it - these are amino acids or salts thereof, and an indicator of easily-digestible protein presence).  <sep>  Q: Why does salt enhance the flavor of food?

As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton. Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry?

The advantage of the minimal disturbance method is that the strands of the meat give the burger structural strength. It also gives a pure beef flavor as you aren't adding anything to it. The mix up method breaks up the strands of meat which come out of the grinder which makes patties more fragile, however flavorings are distributed evenly. Some people add binding agents like egg and breadcrumbs to hold it together when using the mix up method in which case it becomes more of a flat meatball than a burger. My personal preference is the minimal disturbance method as it is fast, the patties hold together, and I like the flavor of pure beef. After forming the patties I salt them on both sides.

Safe preservation recipes have either been extensively tested in a lab, or used for centuries. Making a small change can destroy the delicate balance which leads to a tasty, safe food. The solution here is to look for another recipe, one which is safe but does not contain wine. For something as risky as cured meat, I'd suggest not getting some random recipe off the Internet, but choosing from a book, or maybe from the blog of a known, respectable author.

I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier.

Most explanations WHY that is the case have to with the fact that blenders tend to disintegrate cell walls with relatively rough cuts of a fast but half-sharp or blunt blade, releasing more enzymes etc. from the cell walls as opposed to from the cell contents. These are plausible, since some of the compounds in different parts of onion cells are known to actively react when the onion is disintegrated.Also, try adding oil (which you often want in a marinade anyway. No unrefined olive oil in a blender, though - that is known to get bitter!) while mortaring or blending - this will help extract flavor compounds and probably provide some oxidation protection.There is a well known marinade working with onions, garlic etc: Bulgogi marinade.  <sep>  Q: How long can blended onions stay relatively fresh?

Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year.

If that's the case, you can try cleaning it some way. The problem is that physical cleaning methods probably won't be sufficient, chemical cleaning with alkali will damage the seasoning and chemical cleaning with acid, if the seasoning is compromised, can rust the pan a bit. So there is a high chance you will end up reseasoning. If this really looks and feels like a buildup and not like exposed oxidised metal, my preference would be to soak in warm, not hot, acid. Vinegar or a citric acid solution should work well. Afterwards, try to scrub off with a stiff plastic brush. If it doesn't go away, or the seasoning goes away too, or if this was missing seasoning from the beginning, you have to strip and reseason. We have several questions on the topic, and the Internet is also full of suggestions.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

As you knead the flour, the gluten network develops and results in elasticity. When cooked, water evaporates from the dough leaving a rigid gluten skeleton. Fat does not mix with water and thus stay in blobs in between the gluten network. This weakens the gluten structure, making the pastry crumble.For this reason, you often see in recipes for shortcrust to avoid overmixing the fat. Buttery biscuits such as shortbread crumble more than crackers, which have more water. The same rationale applies to puff pastry. The thin fat layers are impermeable, so water steam gets trapped and exercise pressure upwards, lifting the pastry up.Quoting @GdD in the comments, the punchline is:more fat = crumblier, less fat has more structure.  <sep>  Q: How does altering the fat-to-flour ratio affect the pastry?

So \"leaving out\" is not a problem. The major factors in going rancid are light and air. The more light hits your fat, the sooner it goes rancid. Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year. Also, don't worry that you can get something nasty when the grease goes bad unnoticed. Rancid fat isn't a big safety risk, and ingesting it in small amounts is not problematic.

This may give your bread a more grainy texture (not a bad thing), and makes atta unideal for cakes, biscuits, and quick breads unless you like them with a coarse texture in the crumb.

Most dietary fats are waxy, which means they don't have a single set freezing/melting point, but rather get more viscous or eventually firmer then hard as temperature drops.For example, linzer cookie dough is very frangible, and the chilling and hydration make rolling and cutting much easier.Generally, most of this affect is going to happen in the first 8 hours or so.

Keeping something under a lid and refrigerated restricts the number of airborne colonizers that might get access to it, and the cold temperature means that even if they get there, they will grow much slower than at room temperature.For something to spoil, it needs to be colonized by bacteria or fungus spores, and it needs to contain some nourishment to support their growth, not too much chemicals that prevent their growth, and not too much competing life forms already present. So, things with a high concentration of salt or sugar tend to be unhospitable to bacteria and fungi growth, because they are hygroscopic (they draw the water out of cells). Extreme high or low pH (eg acidic) also retards growth. Think of things like ketchup, mustard, jelly with labels that say \"refrigerate after opening\" but most people ignore them. Alcohol is unfriendly if the concentration is too high, and of course natural fermented foods are already occupied by human-friendly bacteria.Ketchup is sealed in a bottle, usually with no fingers or utensils inserted into it, so it stays pretty sterile. It is also protected by being hygroscopic (due to high concentration of sugar and salt) and its acidity.

While butter melts between 90F and 95F, hydrogenated oils can have melting points up to 120F. This can give an advantage when baking as proteins begin coagulating at around 120F and starches start to gelatinize around 130F. This is easily observed in cookies: cookies made with all butter will spread much more in the oven than cookies made with shortening as the butter has completely melted long before the starches and proteins begin to catch up.In something like a cinnamon smear using butter, if your oven temperature is lower than expected it can cause the butter to melt out the bottom of the cinnamon rolls, carrying a lot of the sugar and flavorings with it. This leads to empty rolls and a layer of toffee on the bottom of the pan.To say that one fat is better than another is very subjective though. While hydrogenated fat has an advantage in melting point, butter has much more flavor. You can also counteract the low melting point of butter by adding a starch or protein to the smear to help bind it, or by mixing butter and shortening together for the smear. Since margarine is usually a blend of oils, this also means that your baking results will be dependent on the blend of oils in your specific product.  <sep>  Q: Should I use butter or margarine for cinnamon rolls?

For cookies, it depends on what effect you want, but many standard types do well in forced-air ovens because the fan helps ensure that the whole oven stays at a uniform temperature despite the presence of several trays. (Of course, the tray closest to the heating element will still cook faster than the one farthest away, so you will still have to swap them partway through.)The general rule for using the fan is to set the oven temperature 25 degrees F (15 C) lower than what the recipe calls for using in a regular oven.

Doing it in the oven won't be any faster or less boring than steaming it - it may even be slower, since heat transfer from steam is pretty efficient. 45 minutes at 120Â°C would probably leave it undercooked, and if you cook at a higher temperature, you'll be missing the point - steaming for a long time lets it cook slowly and more evenly. You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a \"normal\" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding. Then you can increase the temperature of the oven, perhaps to 150-175Â°C, without overheating the pudding. But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired. Covering tightly, and possibly adding a tiny bit more liquid, might help with that.  <sep>  Q: Is it okay to bake caramel pudding rather than steaming it?",

In the plantation culture of the south \"ngambo\" became \"gumbo\" and eventually came to be the word for a soup containing okra. In the deep south of South Carolina and southern Georgia it typically has Okra in it to provide thickening from the mucilaginous substance secreted from the okra.As people moved westward toward the Louisiana region they adopted the Choctaw Indian method of using ground sassafras leaves (gumbe file) as the preferred thickening method in that area. Sidenote: Gumbo file is considered to be the only indigenous north American spice.Without knowing what it is that you've been disappointed with, it's difficult to make suggestions. As with so many regional dishes there are certain consistencies but more often than not...more variations.

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading.Now, because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature, the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven. How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is. In other words, a large roast will have a greater thermal mass â more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature, and the heat will transfer into the coolest point, raising its ultimate temperature.So, the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained.

There is even an upper limit for how much sugar you can add per 100 g of flour, and it's not recommended to use recipes which prescribe more, as they turn out poorly. So I wouldn't change the amount of yeast, unless you make the empirical observation that your yeast is overfed (recognizable by speed of raising and the changed smell).  <sep>  Q: Should I decrease the amount of yeast I add depending on how much sweet I add (I use jaggery) while making sweet bread?

Safe preservation recipes have either been extensively tested in a lab, or used for centuries. Making a small change can destroy the delicate balance which leads to a tasty, safe food.

You can clearly see this if you go look at gas stoves - they're described in units of power (BTUs in the US, hooray). The temperature resulting from a given power will depend greatly on what you're cooking. A burner with nothing on it will have a much higher temperature than one with a heavy pot of boiling water on it. To a lesser degree, the temperature will also depend on the environment - a cooler room with some air circulation will keep the burner a bit cooler than a warm room with still air.So, if you really want to know what you're getting, you have to look up the power output of the stove - or failing that, maybe try to measure it yourself.  <sep>  Q: How hot are electric home stoves?

Removing moisture from onion with the aid of salt helps it reach its desired state (brown or translucent, as desired) faster.I am most familiar with the use of onion in Indian cooking. I generally add a pinch or two of salt to onion when I start sauteing it. Onion starts sweating as soon as you add salt and start stirring. The reason that salt draws out moisture from onion is osmotic pressure. The surface of the onion acts as a semipermeable membrane barrier. Since the solution outside the onion is more concentrated with respect to salt, water moves out of the onion to the general liquid side, to balance the osmotic pressure on either side of the onion surface.  <sep>  Q: Is there any advantage to adding salt to onion while frying?

Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough.

When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were \"hydration\", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as \"hydration\" when figuring Dough Hydration?

When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good.

I suspect uncut strawberries would take at least several days to fully absorb alcohol and reach equilibrium, but the surface should take up alcohol fairly quickly. If they are cut up, exposing the more porous interior, I imagine an overnight soak would be sufficient to reach maximum alcohol content. The enormous, bloated mutant strawberries you sometimes see at stores could take considerably longer than others to absorb their maximum alcohol. Alcohol is much more volatile than water, so the immersion in warm, melted chocolate would remove some alcohol, but once the chocolate cools, it should trap any remaining content.The flavor of alcohol is easily masked by other flavors at under 20% content; this could explain why your friend didn't taste it, but you did.

The mix up method breaks up the strands of meat which come out of the grinder which makes patties more fragile, however flavorings are distributed evenly. Some people add binding agents like egg and breadcrumbs to hold it together when using the mix up method in which case it becomes more of a flat meatball than a burger. My personal preference is the minimal disturbance method as it is fast, the patties hold together, and I like the flavor of pure beef. After forming the patties I salt them on both sides.

Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle.

You could work out how to cook it hotter and faster, but it wouldn't be a steamed pudding anymore, it'd be a \"normal\" pudding.If you want to do it in the oven, you should use a water bath to keep it from getting too hot - put the vessel with the pudding into a larger vessel, and add water to come most of the way up the sides of the pudding.

But I doubt you'll be able to get the cooking time very much less than the original cooking time with steam without significantly changing the results.Finally (thanks Elendil), steaming helps keep the pudding moist, and an oven even with a water bath is not a terribly humid environment, so it might still be drier than desired.

Apart from the notion that a chile is the pepper, which is the main ingredient, and chili is the dish, I don't like to define it too carefully (of course, New Mexicans think the dish is chile too, but what they have is different from Texas chili, even when they use red chiles). I think chili is a stew, though. Most stew isn't chili, but all chili is stew. And I believe that for most people to accept what you're making as chili, it would have to include a significant dose of dried red chile powder.So if you can accept the validity of white chili at all, and what you're making has almost all green chiles and very little red chile, then I'd say you're making a white chili.

In the strict sense, it only has meaning for lean doughs - made of only flour, water, yeast and salt, eventually preferments or later mixins like seeds. You can extend it to enriched doughs (those that have fat, milk, eggs, tomato juice, etc.) but then it is no longer sharply defined. Calculating the exact content of water (e.g. adding to the calculation 17 g of water for every 100 g of butter) are pretty useless, because the water bound in an emulsion or other kind of colloid doesn't behave the same way as free water when making a dough. So, a dough with 100 g water and 100 g butter will be extremely different from a dough with 117 g of water, and still pretty different from one with 117 g of water and 83 g of oil. So, there is no real formula any more to create an actual percentage. The concept still stays somewhat useful in this case, but you have to \"play it by ear\". When you are trying to judge how soft a given enriched dough will be, you can start by calculating all the liquid and fat ingredients as if they were \"hydration\", which gives you a rough guide to compare it to other doughs, and then you have to make it and gain a tactile understanding of how it actually behaves.  <sep>  Q: What counts as \"hydration\" when figuring Dough Hydration?

Also, rancidity occurs when the fat is oxidized, meaning that if you prevent contact with air, your fat will last longer. Both factors are minimized by transferring the fat to a tightly closed opaque container. With liquid oils, you use a dark colored bottle. As bottles are impractical for solid fat, just strain your grease into a jar, close it, and put it in a cupboard. The shelf life should be many months, probably more than a year.

For something like a beef or pork roast, the coolest point will be generally in the very center of the roast. For chicken or turkey, it will often be where the leg joins the body. You may need to probe more than one more place to find the coolest reading.Now, because the meat surrounding that coolest point is at a higher temperature, the meat will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven. How much of an increase will depend on how big the roast is. In other words, a large roast will have a greater thermal mass â more meat towards the outside will be at a higher temperature, and the heat will transfer into the coolest point, raising its ultimate temperature.So, the practical answer to your question is that you need to anticipate when the target temperature will be attained. To err on the side of food safety, keep the meat in the oven until it reaches or is very close to the target temperature. With a little experience, you'll be able to gauge how much of a temperature increase occurs with various roasts, and remove it from the oven earlier.The bottom line however, is that the roast needs to ultimately reach the target temperature.  <sep>  Q: When should the temperature of meat be taken?

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

While I don't know the whole theory behind it, each time it happened, there was something just below the hole, let's call it \"the lump\". What I think happens is that the lump is too heavy. When the batter below it tries to rise, it doesn't have the strength to push up the lump. This could be combined with differences in heat transfer throughout the batter vs. on the batter-lump transition in preventing rising (I am certain they exist, but I don't know whether they have an effect at all). The result is a hole where the batter didn't rise, surrounded by nicely risen batter. As to where the lump comes from: you say \"chocolate and pear cake\". If you have pear pieces in the batter, right under the surface, they can do this. I have certainly seen it happen when the recipe includes fruit pieces in the batter. If there are no pear pieces, my second guess is badly dissolved flour. The directions for this type of cake normally include folding the whites very gently, and generally erring on the side of too little whisking. This could contribute to uneven batter texture, resulting in lumps. In the second case, the cake may have some less-than-pleasant pieces, but will still be mostly good.

Use a substitute if you have an aversion - honey, agave, raw cane sugar, whatever you prefer. (Of course, anything liquid is going to contain some water, and cause a bit of ice, but it's still doable.) A sorbet without any extra sugar, even when frozen normally in an ice cream maker, is going to end up with a very icy texture, which will probably keep you from experiencing the flavor as much. The sugar helps soften it.The other common way to soften a sorbet is alcohol. RosÃ© wine (thank you, David Lebovitz) works quite well in a strawberry sorbet. Vodka can be your go-to liquor for any impromptu sorbet with other fruits, since it'll add alcohol without any flavors that clash. Beyond that, either look for recipes, or look for mixed drinks containing the fruit you're using.You might also be having problems simply because your strawberries aren't that great. Did you freeze them, or were they storebought? If you bought the strawberries yourself, you'd know they were decent before freezing, while not all storebought frozen fruit is as flavorful.Finally, it's possible that your frozen strawberries collected some extra water in the form of frost, which then makes your sorbet icier.

But it is also very forgiving, so it will probably still give you decent edible bread if you do it by time. The best way is to wait until it has doubled, no matter what the clock shows. But you insist on going by the clock, don't change the time, wait the 30 minutes. It may be underproofed (with such a short time given by the recipe, there is virtually no chance of overproofing it), but the same would have happened if you were using the original amounts and going by the clock. Dough proofing and timeThe rising time for dough at room temperature is not affected by recipe scaling, the time it takes a specific dough to double will be the same regardless of the size of your batch. If the temperature in your proofing container is significantly different from the dough temperature, you will see some effect on rising times with different batch sizes and dough shapes, as the center of the dough will need some time to get to the same temperature as the proofing container, and warmer dough rises quicker than cold dough. This is unlikely to have a measurable effect at dough amounts used by home bakers, especially considering that the possible proofing temperature window is rather narrow.  <sep>  Q: How does halving a bread recipe impact rising time?

On top of that, you don't have to worry about whether you can find good fresh tomatoes, e.g. if it's winter and they're out of season.Your two cases for comparison seem to overlook this: if you just chop and cook, you'll have skin and seeds in your sauce, as well as excess liquid to cook down, while if you use passata, you won't. (Also, for what it's worth, you'd need pretty giant tomatoes to get the equivalent of 3/4 cup of passata out of one tomato.)Of course, if you don't mind skin and seeds, it's also perfectly fine to simply cook fresh tomatoes and be done with it.Note that you can often get similar advantages from other canned tomato products.

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.
