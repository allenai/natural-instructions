    ],

    "Definition": "Paraphrase the given questions to have different wording. Your paraphrased questions should have the same answer as the original question. Try to change the sentence as much as possible using synonyms and/or rearranging the structure of the sentence. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \"this national park\", \"this dog breed\", and \"this president\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in paraphrasing, this keyword should also be used the same way. \nThings to avoid: 1. Do not write questions that compare or involve multiple domains, 2. Do not write open-ended or subjective questions(e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.) \n\n Emphasis & Caution: 1. Make your questions specific and concrete, 2. Your question should have the same type of answer as the original question(e.g., if the question is extractive, the paraphrased question should be extractive as well.)",
