    "Definition": "You are given a target person and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence conveys either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target.  A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them.",

            "output": "anti-stereotype",
            "explanation": "This is an anti-stereotype because as a stereotype, mothers do not drink alcohol and do not have a casual, care-free stance when they do so."
