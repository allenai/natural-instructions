To see if you might be eligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, visit our pre-screening tool. For households in the 48 Contiguous States and the District of Columbia October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017. To get SNAP benefits, households must meet certain tests, including resource and income tests: 1  Resources. 2  Income. 3  Deductions. 4  Employment Requirements. 5  Special Rules for Elderly or Disabled. 6  Immigrant Eligibility. In fact, we’re not spending enough on food stamps. The need for food assistance is greater than food stamps can fill, and the benefit amount is too low to allow a family to purchase an adequate, healthy diet. The average monthly food stamp benefit per person is only $133.85, or less than $1.50 per person, per meal. Between 2009-2011 the purchasing power of food stamps declined by about 7%, or $47/month for a family of four, due to inflation in the cost of food. You’ve likely heard stories (and outrage) about people using food stamps to purchase “steak and lobster” as well as cigarettes and alcohol, showing up at the grocery store in a nice car, nice clothes, a nice purse or an iPhone. But the federal government sets the food stamps benefit amount at, on average, roughly $4 a day per person. Yes, someone could save up their monthly allotment to buy some high-priced food items for a special occasion. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Effective October 2016. Maximum Monthly SNAP Amounts. The chart below shows the maximum dollar amount of SNAP benefits your household can receive each month. This dollar amount is based on the number of people in your household, your income and your expenses. You could receive any amount up to or including these amounts. National Standards for reasonable amounts have been established for five necessary expenses: food, housekeeping supplies, apparel and services, personal care products and services, and miscellaneous. See the SNAP page on Applicants and Recipients for detailed information about eligibility requirements and benefits. The SNAP home page provides access to information on all aspects of the program. fns On average, 45 million people received SNAP benefits each month in fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 percent increase over the roughly 26 million people (or one of every 11) who received benefits in 2007. The truth is, a $125 per person per month grocery budget may seem like a farce to a household currently spending $300 per person per month, but it’s actually quite achievable. *For households with more than eight people, add $5,408 per additional person. Always check with the appropriate managing agency to ensure the most accurate guidelines. To see if you might be eligible for SNAP benefits, use SNAP's pre-screening tool.

Most people with broken ribs do not need surgery. In the emergency room you may have received a strong medicine (such as a nerve block or narcotics) if you were in severe pain. You will not have a belt or a bandage around your chest because these would keep your ribs from moving when you breathe or cough. Broken ribs are often the very first sign of multiple myeloma at work. My ribs broke in a fall in late 2008. They have never healed ( bone to bone, that is). They have scarred over and generally stay in place--but they do remind me--when I do any hard trunk twisting exercise / movement / throwing / jumping . These complicated fractured ribs are often more unstable during activity and breathing and will likely take longer to heal; some may never heal normally. 3D reconstruction of fractured ribs before surgery. Historically, good pain control and at times the use of a stabilizing elastic binder (to wrap around the chest) have been the only treatment options for most rib fractures. These treatment options continue to be utilized and are effective for many patients with uncomplicated rib fractures. For the more complicated rib fractures we may also consider early surgical intervention to stabilize the unstable and/or displaced fractures. A rib fracture can be very painful because your ribs move when you breathe, cough, and move your upper body. The ribs in the middle of the chest are the ones that break most often. Rib fractures often occur with other chest and organ injuries. So your health care providers will also check to see if you have any other injuries. You may need prescription pain medicines (narcotics) to keep your pain under control while your bones heal. 1  Take these medicines on the schedule your health care provider prescribed. 2  DO NOT drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery while you are taking these medicines. How long does it take for a fractured rib take to heal on a 1-2 month old infant? And would there be any physical signs such as bruising on the skin? Dr. Ed Friedlander Dr. Friedlander A: Most fractured ribs heal within a month or two, states Mayo Clinic. While the rib is healing, it is very important to control pain so the patient can breathe comfortably. When a cracked rib prevents deep breathing, lung conditions such as pneumonia may occur. So why didn’t your doctor try to keep your broken ribs from moving by taping your ribs? Here’s the dilemma: Your ribs have to move every time you take a breath. And we all need to breathe.

Foods that should be discarded after four hours are meats, dairy, soft unprocessed cheeses, and prepared meals or leftovers. What's the fridge life? For semi-hard and semi-soft cheeses -- the middle ground -- your time frame is a little less than harder cheeses. There's more moisture present in the cheeses, so they aren't going to keep as long. I'd say two to four weeks after the expiration date is the basic time frame. Here are some tips for proper way of refrigerating cheese: 1  Keep refrigerated and tightly sealed.

If applicable, remove the vent caps and check the battery's water level and, if low, add distilled water to cover the tops of the plates. How long do you have to run a car engine to charge the battery back to the point it was at before starting the car? Do NOT charge the battery before you test the open circuit voltage. If the voltmeter shows a voltage reading of 12.2 volts then the battery is approximately 50% charged. Since the battery is 50% charged, this means that there is approximately half of the 60 amp-hours in the battery or 30 amp-hours. Slow, fast, and faster: Where to charge electric cars Charging an electric car is not quite as easy as just plugging it in. There are different charging options that fill a car's battery and different rates. In manual testing with the 12V car voltmeter, it does appear that I have about 14,1V to 14,3V at idle with everything off for a few minutes after starting the car, but if I do turn both seats and the AC on, then it goes down to maybe as low as 13,1V or so. The J1772 plug was specifically designed for electric car charging. Problem is, given a typical electric car like the Nissan Leaf, it can take 15 hours to charge the battery from empty to its EPA-rated 75-mile range from that standard household source. Most plug-in cars have a J1772 port, letting them plug into public charging stations. Therefore it is necessary to put about 30 amp hours plus 20% more to compensate for the internal resistance in the battery for a total of 30 amps x 0.2 = 36 amp-hours to fully charge your battery. Step 3: If you charge your battery at a 10-amp rate and you need to replace 36 amp-hours in the battery. To determine how long (in hours) you will need to charge your battery, divided 36 by 10 = 3.6 or 3.6 hours to recharge your battery. A 12 volt / 10 amp 3-stage automatic charger is the best ... Step up to twin chargers on the car and connect to a 240-volt, high-power wall charger (an extra-cost charging unit, not just a 240-volt line) and the charging speed zooms to 62 miles of range per hour, and the total charging time drops to under 4 hours, 45 minutes. If we were recharging the battery with a 15-amp battery charger, the recharge time would be roughly 3.6-hours. Again, this example does not take into account the multi-step charging approach of most smart battery chargers, but it does serve as an excellent guide to battery recharge times. Charge time for a dead battery can take up to 12 hours or longer. There are many factors that determine how long the charge will take, including the size and age of the...

Types of Surgeons and Average Compensation for Each. 1  General Surgeons: (5 Years of residency, no fellowship required) Perform appendectomies, hernia surgeries, and other types of surgeries including liver, spleen, intestinal, and some head, neck, chest surgeries, excluding hearts. In surgery, the training is rigorous and the lifestyle that accompanies a busy surgical practice is taxing, but surgery is also one of the most rewarding fields of medicine. After training, the average general surgeon works 50-60 hours per week (not including time available for call). Depending on the practice situation chosen, you can be on call as much as all the time (if in private solo practice) to once a week (if in a large group practice). The following specialists are some of the most common examples: 1  Allergists (specialists in diagnosing and treating hay fever or other allergies) 2  Cardiologists (heart specialists) 3  Dermatologists (skin specialists) 4  Gastroenterologists (digestive system specialists) 5  Ophthalmologists (eye specialists) Pediatricians who work full time don't necessarily work a standard 40-hour week, according to a December 2009 article in “Pediatrics,” which reported full-time pediatricians in subspecialties such as pediatric surgery worked an average of 33.7 hours a week.

Anorthosite Fest. Through a Global Forum initiative at Brown University, Professor Lew Ashwal from Witwatersrand University in South Africa visited the Department of Geological Sciences from July 16 to 27th. The overall goal of the Forum was to initiate long-term research links with prominent universities around the globe. Lew is a world expert on terrestrial anorthosite formation and his visit sparked broad interest and support across Brown/MIT NLSI for discussions on the formation of lunar anorthosite. During Lew’s visit, the current knowledge of the origin of both terrestrial and lunar anorthosites was reviewed and interdisciplinary research directions discussed. Anorthosite and labradorescence. Anorthosite is an igneous monomineralic rock that is composed of plagioclase feldspar (over 90% of the rock is composed of this mineral). Plagioclase is a very common mineral group, more than half of the Earth’s crust is composed of it. Anorthosite in many cases is not light-colored at all. This is the result of tiny Fe-Ti oxide inclusions in plagioclase crystals that give them bluish-black hue. One fascinating aspect associated with many anorthosites is an effect called labradorescence. It is a special form of iridescence. of the western body of gabbroic anorthosite (Rose, 1960). The anorthosite probably originally formed by plagioclase floatation in mafic magma chamber at the base of the crust (Ashwal, 1993). The ores for med late during the crystallization of anorthosite by concentration of Fe-Ti oxides (Ashwal, 1993). metamorphism: (1) precipitation of metamorphic zircon from solid state reactions involving breakdown of Zr-bearing phases or (2) precipitation of partial intergranular melt, enriched in zirconium by partial reabsorbion of Lew Ashwal greeting an old friend. Credit: Brown/MIT. Lew’s visit began with two extended lectures by him on terrestrial anorthosites, followed by a three-day field trip to anorthosite regions in the Adirondacks. A few people raised questions about how the new-found H2O in the lunar mantle would change our models of anorthosite formation. Also, the issue of how the very pure anorthosite (with scarce mafic minerals) widely observed across the Moon is formed was also discussed. In comparing the lunar anorthosites to terrestrial examples, it was unclear whether they were analogous to Archean anorthosites, which have similarly high An contents, but are thought to be derived from hydrous magmas. metamorphic zircon for mation in samples studied by Bingen et al.

Active transport is the movement of molecules or ions against a concentration gradient (from an area of lower to higher concentration), which does not ordinarily occur, so enzymes and energy are required. Passive transport is the movement of molecules or ions from an area of higher to lower concentration. There are multiple forms of passive transport: simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration, and osmosis. Passive transport occurs because of the entropy of the system, so additional energy isn't required for it to occur. Compare. Both active and passive transport move materials and can cross biological membranes.

The closer together the studs a … re located, the stronger the structure becomes. Locate Nearby Studs. If you are hanging wide shelving, you may want to know how far apart your studs are so that you can anchor both ends. In most homes, they are placed 16 inches apart, but occasionally, you will find them spaced 24 inches apart. Measure the distance and use the steps above to locate your second stud. Wrap the head of your hammer in a dish towel or other cloth to prevent wall damage and rap gently on your wall where you suspect the stud should be. If you hear a hollow sound, then the stud is to the right or left. Bearing walls (walls that carry a heavy roof or floor load) need studs no more than 16 inches apart. Non-bearing walls can generally have the studs spaced 24 inches apart.Standards vary according to location, so it is a good practice to find out what the building codes in your area are. The normal spacing for studs in modern construction is 16 inches apart. One way to find a stud for hanging shelving is to measure in 16 inch increments from the outlet or switch until you get to the place where you want to hang your shelf. 24'stud wall they want to place the studs 24 apart on center how many studs will they need?

            "input": "There are two fundamentally different types of synapses: 1  In a chemical synapse, electrical activity in the presynaptic neuron is converted (via the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels) into the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds to receptors located in the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell. The main advantage of an electrical synapse is the rapid transfer of signals from one cell to the next. Synaptic communication is distinct from an ephaptic coupling, in which communication between neurons occurs via indirect electric fields. An autapse is a chemical or electrical synapse that forms when the axon of one neuron synapses onto dendrites of the same neuron. Types of interfaces How does communication occur within a neuron? The KGB Agent answer: Communication between neurons essentially happens by means of the nerve impulse where electrical & chemical events happen to enable transmission of signal. Key points. 1  Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. 2  Most synapses are chemical; these synapses communicate using chemical messengers. 3  At a chemical synapse, an action potential triggers the presynaptic neuron to release neurotransmitters. Key points. 1  Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. At a synapse, one neuron sends a message to a target neuron—another cell. 2  Most synapses are chemical; these synapses communicate using chemical messengers. Other synapses are electrical; in these synapses, ions flow directly between cells. In the nervous system, a synapse is a structure that permits a neuron (or nerve cell) to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another neuron or to the target efferent cell. Santiago Ramón y Cajal proposed that neurons are not continuous throughout the body, yet still communicate with each other, an idea known as the neuron doctrine.

Thursday, February 02 2012. Synapses are essential to neuronal function: neurons are cells that are specialized to pass signals to individual target cells, and synapses are the means by which they do so. At a synapse, the plasma membrane of the signal-passing neuron (the presynaptic neuron) comes into close apposition with the membrane of the target (postsynaptic) cell.

            "input": "Eventually, radiation pressure from the star blows away the envelope and the new star begins its evolution. The properties and lifetime of the new star depend on the amount of gas that remains trapped. A star like our sun has a lifetime of about 10 billion years and is just middle-aged, with another five billion years or so left. And once the fusion reactions begin, they exert an outward pressure. As long as the inward force of gravity and the outward force generated by the fusion reactions are equal, the star remains stable. Clouds of gas are common in our galaxy and in other galaxies like ours. These clouds are called nebulae. A typical nebula is many light-years across and contains enough mass to make several thousand stars the size of our sun. The majority of the gas in nebulae consists of molecules of hydrogen and helium--but most nebulae also contain atoms of other elements, as well as some surprisingly complex organic molecules. STAR BIRTHS are started when the interstellar matter in gas clouds, such as the Eagle Nebula shown here, compresses and fuses. Irregularities in the density of the gas causes a net gravitational force that pulls the gas molecules closer together. NGC 6326, a planetary nebula with glowing wisps of outpouring gas that are lit up by a binary central star. A planetary nebula, often abbreviated as PN or plural PNe, is a kind of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from old red giant stars late in their lives. A star is born when atoms of light elements are squeezed under enough pressure for their nuclei to undergo fusion. All stars are the result of a balance of forces: the force of gravity compresses atoms in interstellar gas until the fusion reactions begin. Most planetary nebulae form at the end of the star's life, during the red giant phase, when the outer layers of the star are expelled by strong stellar winds. After most of the red giant's atmosphere is dissipated, the ultraviolet radiation of the hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (PNN), ionizes the ejected material. A planetary nebula, abbreviated as PN or plural PNe, is a kind of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives. The word nebula is Latin for mist or cloud, and the term planetary nebula is a misnomer that originated in the 1780s with astronomer William Herschel because, when viewed through his telescope, these objects resemble the rounded shapes of planets. Herschel's name for these objects was popularly adopted and A planetary nebula, often abbreviated as PN or plural PNe, is a kind of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from old red giant stars late in their lives.[2] The word nebula is Latin for mist or cloud, and the term planetary nebula is a misnomer that originated in the 1780s with astronomer William ... Theoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of between one and eight solar masses, which puts the progenitor star's age at greater than 40 million years. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a planetary nebula within.

The length of the type specimen of P. walkeri is estimated at 9.5 meters (31 ft). What environment did a parasaurolophus live in? Parasaurolophus lived along the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The area was a floodplain with rivers and swamps, and had distinct wet and dry seasons. Conifers …were the primary trees, but other plants like ferns, ginkgoes, cycads, and flowering plants also lived there. Brachiosaurus was an unusual dinosaur that lived 155.7 million to 150.8 million years ago during the mid- to late Jurassic Period. Specimens have been found primarily in the fossil-rich Morrison Formation in North America, but the dinosaur did not resemble any of the others that roamed the region. Its long neck made it look like a giraffe, and its forelegs were longer than its hind legs. The name Brachiosaurus, in fact, means arm lizard.. When did dinosaurs live? Dinosaurs lived between about 247 and 66 million years ago, in a time known as the Mesozoic Era. This was many millions of years before the first modern humans, Homo sapiens, appeared. Scientists divide the Mesozoic Era into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. What period did the parasaurolophus live? Parasaurolophus lived from about 76.5 to 73 million years ago. This was near the end of the Cretaceous period, the last period in the Mesozoic era. Parasaurolophus Facts. 1  Check out our Parasaurolophus facts for kids. The Parasaurolophus was an interesting dinosaur with a strangely shaped head that featured a curved crest. 2  Read on and learn more cool information about the Parasaurolophus, including where it lived, how long it was, the function of its strange looking crest and much more. Parasaurolophus lived in the late Cretaceous Period, around 75 million years ago, in what is now North America. Fossils have been found in Alberta, Canada as well as Utah and New Mexico, USA. The Parasaurolophus was first described by William Parks in 1922, two years after a partial skeleton and skull were found in Alberta. Parasaurolophus were herbivores (plant eaters). It could walk on either two legs or all four.

They were herbivores (plant eaters) that used their strong back legs to reach higher branches. Find out more about the Cretaceous plants they ate. Where did they live? How big were they? They were 10 metres (33 feet) in length and weighed 3.5 tons. Their huge head crest could grow to 1.8 metres long. Kids-Dinosaurs › Parasaurolophus Parasaurolophus was a herbivore, eating pine needles, leaves, and twigs. Fossilized stomach contents show that it ate mostly land plants. With its long neck, parasaurolophus would have been able to find food on the ground or in trees. Parasaurolophus was a member of the duckbill family of dinosaurs, meaning it had a hard beak in the front of its mouth and hundreds of teeth in the back for chewing tough plant material. Parasaurolophus lived during the late Cretaceous period, about 76-65 Million years ago. Other dinosaurs living in the late Cretaceous in North America were Albertosaurus, Nanotyrannus, Lambeosaurus (another hadrosaur), Euoplocephalus, Kritosaurus, and Pachyrhinosaurus.Parasaurolophus was named by Dr. William A.

You can use bottom heat to maintain a soil temperature around 24 deg C for about 10 days. Planting and germinating eggplant requires you to use the right type of soil and a container that is about an inch full. Plant and germinate eggplant with help from a classically-trained chef with experience in both world-class restaurants and private dining companies in this free video clip. Expert: Teca Thompson Filmmaker: Rudi Rose Sow eggplant seeds indoors 8 weeks before the last frost in spring using a seed starting kit. Sow seeds ¼ inch deep in seed-starting formula Keep the soil moist at 75 degrees F There’s no particular eggplant seed preparation necessary prior to sowing. Eggplant seeds germinate at temps between 60-95 degrees F. (15-35 C.) and seedlings will emerge in seven to 10 days. When growing with eggplant seeds instead of nursery starts, the seeds will remain viable for about four years. The leaves are generally lobed and about 4 - 8 inches long. Flowers/Fruits: Flowers can be white or some shade of purple, with five-lobes. The fruit varies from small and round, to long and thin, to hefty orbs. Fruits are actually berries, with lots of tiny seeds inside the flesh. Botanical Name. Solanum melongena. Common Name(s) 1) Seed Viability Relative to Germination: 1  Shelf life: Tomato seeds tend to last much longer in storage than most other seed (i.e., onions need to be purchased fresh every year). Just make sure they were stored properly (cool & dry) and you should have around a 4-5 year shelf life for tomato seeds. Eggplants are in the Solanaceae, or nightshade, family, along with tomatoes, peppers and potatoes. Many of us grew up thinking of eggplant as large, somewhat oval shaped, purple vegetables. There wasn’t a lot of variety in what we could grow or how we ate it. Thankfully, that is no longer the case. Growing From Seed. Because eggplants require a relatively long time to mature and will not thrive in cool weather, if you plan to grow your eggplants from seed, you will need to begin them indoors, about eight to 10 weeks before the average last frost date for your region. Seeds need warm soil to germinate and for the seedlings to grow quickly. The ideal soil temperature for germination is between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, so be sure to keep your seedlings in a warm location in your home or use a heating mat to warm the soil. Faster Pepper and Eggplant Seed Germination One issue that many gardeners face is that pepper and eggplant seeds can take forever to germinate.

Still, baby moose don't have the ability to run or protect themselves very well, so the mother stays with her offspring for a year and a half, fighting off wolves and bears that try to pick off the young calves. 8. The Alaska or Yukon Moose is the biggest sub-species. Bulls can get 2.5m high at the shoulders (average 2m) and up to 3.1m long at a weight of 1000 kg. A full-grown bull with its tremendous antlers ( about 23kg, 2m wide) is the largest wild animal in North America.

Moose live in Alaska Answer: Moose are found naturally in North America and Europe. The size of this moose is somewhere in the middle, tending to relative big. The length of a bull moose is around 2.70m, the weight can be more than 500 kg. The cow weighs between 275 and 375 kg. The length of the bulls skull is between 55 and 58cm. European moose are colored dark brown with white legs. How large is a moose? Moose is the largest of all the deer species. They reach 170 – 210 cm height at shoulder. Bulls weigh weigh 380 – 850 kg and cows weigh 200 – 360 kg. How long do they live? Moose may live up to 25 years but because of the intensive hunting few moose survive to become older than 10 years. Since more bulls are hunted only 5-10% of the bulls reach the age of 5 years, but cows often become 10 or even 20 years old. What does a moose look like? Dark brown body with long greyish white legs. Alaska moose require a daily intake of 9770 kilocalories (32 kg). Alaska moose lack upper front teeth but have eight sharp incisors on their lower jaw. They also have a tough tongue, gums and lips to help chew woody vegetation. Size and weight. Male Alaska moose can stand over 2.1 m (6.9 ft) at the shoulder, and weigh over 1,400 lb (635 kg). The antlers on average have a span of 1.8 m (5.9 ft). Female Alaska moose stand on average 1.8 m (5.9 ft) at the shoulder and can weigh close to 478 kg (1,054 lb). The largest Alaska moose was shot in western Yukon in September 1897; it weighed 820 kg (1,808 lb), and was 2.33 m (7.6 ft) tall at the shoulder.

A height of 12.5cm gives about 4088cm³ of volume which is about 4 liters of dough. The increase of 2.5cm is hard to notice and you will not perceive this as the dough having ‘doubled in size’. After this whole rant I still do not have the answer to what recipes writers mean with ‘wait until double in size’. Do they mean double in volume, double in height, they probably mean something like ‘wait until the dough has increased until you think it is enough’. Comments. 1  I have an engineers approach and I have assumed double in volume is what was ment. So I have always judged the increase by eye and the poke test but unlike your more scientific approach waited for the indentation to stay. 2  Hi Ed, For my calculations I start with an imaginary boule of dough with a height of 10cm. This gives us a boule of dough with the volume of 2093cm³ which is a little over 2 liters of dough. When you take a boule with a height of 20cm this equals about 16745cm³ which is about 16 liters of dough! So a doubling in diameter equals 8 times the growth in actual volume.

The simply answer to the long-term success rate of dental implants are that dental implants can fail, but fortunately very infrequently. Failure rates vary depending on the site in the mouth, whether they are placed into natural or grafted bone and whether the patient smokes. The overall success rates in natural bone is 95%, though this falls to between 85 and 90% in grafted bone. The snap on dentures, MDI supported dentures, fixed hybrid implant dentures can be remove and place easily. Although some people prefer to have a permanent bridgework done dentures are a great alternative. How do Snap-on dentures work? There are two types of denture with the snap-on effect. Bar retained and ball retained. Most of the patients in our office that have implant dentures have a snap in style denture. The ease of cleaning, comfortable fit, retention, esthetic looks, and stability make it a great choice for a lot of patients with only a few drawbacks. As to the longevity of dental implants, honestly at the present time we cannot answer this question. However, according to various resources , Gösta Larsson was the first patient who had dental implants placed. So your answer is as follows: They work well in most cases and last a long time in most cases. If one abuses them or develops medical issues then the life span can be decreased.

Before I had that page (24-hour Hormone Saliva Test) up, many people would contact me asking if I knew of a source for a saliva hormone testing kit that did not require a doctor's order, either because they were not working with a doctor, or the doctor would not order one for them and they didn't know where to look to find one on their own. 7 days at room temperature. This produces a very bad smelling sample. It does not appear to affect the cortisol levels, but it sure affects the mood of the technicians assaying the samples! So whenever possible, saliva samples should be stored at -20 degrees Celsius or lower. Q: Do I have to use dry ice if I send my samples to the laboratory? A: No. Once your hormone levels are balanced, testing your hormones once a year will be adequate. I'm having a difficult time collecting enough saliva to fill the tube. If you are having difficulty collecting saliva we have a few recommendations: First of all, allow extra time—at least 20 to 40 minutes before collection. Some insurance plans also cover saliva cortisol testing. How can I get this test done? Talk to your health care professional about your symptoms and ask if this test would be useful for you. Unfortunately many physicians are still unaware of the validity, reliability and value of saliva hormone tests. Some labs, such as ZRT and Genova, allow patients to order tests directly. Several other labs also do saliva testing. You can search online using “saliva test” as your search word. For more ... I prefer dried urine hormone testing because it combines the advantages of saliva testing (ability to measure diurnal production of cortisol) and 24-hour urine testing (ability to measure androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites in addition to the hormones themselves). Saliva for cortisol testing is usually collected by inserting a swab into the mouth and waiting a few minutes while the swab becomes saturated with saliva. Obtaining more than one sample allows the health practitioner to evaluate the daily pattern of cortisol secretion (the diurnal variation). Here’s another important thing to know about cortisol testing. Taking a single measurement, or even a 24-hour average, is not enough. The best cortisol tests take 4 individual samples at various points of the day and then map your cortisol levels over the course of a 24 hour cycle. Collecting saliva. 1  Use of the straws included to funnel saliva into each tube is optional. 2  Each tube should be 3/4 full - bubbles or foam are acceptable. 3  FILL ALL FOUR TUBES regardless of how many tests are ordered. 4  Please dispose of straws before shipping. 5  Seal box with enclosed sticker. Extra tape is not necessary. Because cortisol levels change throughout the day, the timing of a cortisol test is important. A cortisol blood test is usually done twice a day–once in the morning when cortisol levels are at their highest, and again around 4 p.m., when levels are much lower. Cortisol may also be measured in a urine or saliva test. For a cortisol urine test, your health care provider may ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. It is used because cortisol levels vary throughout the day. Query: how long does a cortisol saliva test takes",

The larvae are aquatic, tan to black, less than 2 inches long, and have three pairs of external gills extending from the base of the head. Habitat. Long-toed salamanders live in moist habitats, from timbered valley floors to alpine meadows and alpine lake shorelines. They are usually found near a pond, lake, or stream, often under logs. Adults are dormant during winter and emerge from ground or log burrows in early spring. In the wild, the average life span of a barred tiger salamander is around 3 years.

Adults mature at age two to three and can live up to seven years or more. Ecology and status Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander absorbs water and oxygen through its skin and lives on land and water at various stages of its life. Once they have bred, these amphibians move to upland areas. Food. Adult long-toed salamanders eat a variety of invertebrates, including slugs, worms, and insects.

The rational part of a teen’s brain isn’t fully developed and won’t be until age 25 or so. In fact, recent research has found that adult and teen brains work differently. Adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Teens process information with the amygdala. This is the emotional part. At what age is the brain fully developed? Although brain development is subject to significant individual variation, most experts suggest that the brain is fully developed by age 25. For some people, brain development may be complete prior to age 25, while for others it may end after age 25. The mid-20s or “25” is just an average age given as checkpoint for when the brain has likely become mature. A control group of 17 older students, ranging in age from 25 to 35, were also studied for comparison. The results indicate that significant changes took place in the brains of these individuals. The changes were localized to regions of the brain known to integrate emotion and cognition. We used to think that the brain was fully developed by very early teenagerhood and we now realise that the brain doesn't stop developing until mid-20s or even early 30s. There's a lot more information and evidence to suggest that actually brain development in various forms goes on throughout the life span. When your brain processes the same signals over and over, those networks will get stronger, like working out a muscle.

In fact, most American women receive no pay during their maternity leave and instead rely on federal parental leave law (called the Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA) to protect their job for up to 12 weeks after childbirth or adoption. Many women technically aren't even eligible for unpaid time off under family leave laws, either because they haven't been at a job long enough (FMLA stipulates that you've been working at your current job at least 12 months and 1,250 hours) or because their company is too small (the law only applies to companies with more than 50 employees within a 75-mile radius). Parental leave has been available as a legal right and/or governmental program for many years, in one form or another.

            "input": "If you want to know how long your food poisoning will last, then you need to figure out which type of food poisoning you likely have. If you are feeling ill, take a look at the following food poisoning duration chart. These symptoms typically last for a few days or longer. Symptoms that last for more than 2 weeks, however, are a sign of chronic diarrhea. Call your doctor if you think that you have chronic diarrhea or if you see blood in your stool. When Will Symptoms Appear? When you were a kid, did you like to chant diarrhea, diarrhea to make your friends laugh? Now you probably associate the word with discomfort and embarrassment because having diarrhea is no fun. But nearly everybody gets it once in a while, usually due to gastrointestinal infections. There are three general classifications of diarrhea defined by how long the condition persists: 2 • Acute Diarrhea. This is when the illness only lasts between several hours to two weeks. According to Medical News Today, acute diarrhea is defined by world guidelines as the presence of three or more abnormally loose or watery stools in the preceding 24 hours. 3 It is usually caused by infection — bacterial, viral or parasitic. 4 Medications, especially antibiotics, are another common cause of acute diarrhea, because they upset the balance of good and bad bacteria in your gut. 5,6 • Persistent Diarrhea. It is when you suffer from diarrhea for two to four weeks. The most common causes of persistent diarrhea are listed below: 7,8 Diarrhea that lasts for more than two days in an adult or one day in a child, or which occurs with an infant. Severe diarrhea. Frequent vomiting. Blood in either stool or vomit. Extreme cramping or abdominal pain. Dehydration, which can include excessive thirst, little urination, sunken eyes, and dizziness. Black or tarry stool. The incubation period for a gastrointestinal infection depends on the particular germ causing it. For example, the Shigella incubation period is usually 2 to 4 days, but the period for viral infections ranges from 4 to 48 hours. Parasitic infections generally have longer incubation periods; for instance, in a Giardia infection, symptoms can take from 1 to 4 weeks to appear. Then, depending on the type of germ and the person's overall health, a diarrheal infection can last for a few days or a few weeks. The word diarrhea with its odd spelling is a near steal from the Greek diarrhoia meaning a flowing through. Diarrhea can be acute, that is, sudden in onset and short-lived, or it may be prolonged. Most acute episodes of diarrhea are due to viral infections and last three to five days. Prolonged diarrhea -- lasting more than four to six weeks -- usually is due to an underlying gastrointestinal disease, the most common of which are diseases that cause inflammation and malabsorption of food. If your sickness does not seem to match one of the five most common types, you may have a rare form of food poisoning. While some of these can last for as little as a day, others (i.e. hepatitis and cyclosporiasis) can last for as long as several months. By narrowing down the foods you ate and your symptoms, you can determine just how long you have to wait to be healthy again. In most cases, you can expect to be feeling better within 10 days. Evaluation by a physician generally is needed if diarrhea is severe, results in dehydration, persists for more than a couple of weeks (chronic diarrhea), or if there is a high fever or blood in the stools. Here are a few types of GI infections that you may have heard about: 1  Salmonella bacteria lead to between 1 and 5 million cases of diarrheal illness in the United States each year. These bacteria, a major cause of food poisoning, are frequently found in raw chicken or eggs. Query: how long does diarrhea last when sick",

You can qualify to request your lien be withdrawn, if: 1  Your tax liability has been satisfied (you’ve paid what you owe) and your lien has been released; 2  You are in compliance for the past three years in filing your individual and business returns, and information returns (as applicable) and; If you have more than one tax lien on your report that is eligible for removal, you will need a Form 12277 for each lien you want withdrawn.

In animal cells, division involves myosin and a contractile ring made of actin filaments. During cytokinesis, the role of the string is played by the contractile ring. Now, the contractile ring is composed of actin filaments that are assembled just below the cell membrane. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, the splitting of the cytoplasm . In cell division, a parent cell splits, producing two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. Eukaryotic unicellular organisms like the protist Amoeba use cell division in the production of new individuals, propagating their species. The cleavage furrow that divides an animal cell is also called a contractile ring. It is believed that the course taken by the narrowing contractile ring during cytokinesis is determined by the microtubules of the cell's mitotic spindle or positioned by a spatial cue taken from the cell's medial nucleus.

Chemoembolization is not recommended in cases of severe liver or kidney dysfunction, abnormal blood clotting, prior surgery or stenting of the bile duct, or a blockage of the bile ducts. In some cases—despite liver dysfunction—chemoembolization may be done in small amounts and in several procedures to try and minimize the effect on the normal liver. Embolization is a procedure that injects substances to try to block or reduce the blood flow to cancer cells in the liver. The liver is unusual in that it has 2 blood supplies. Most normal liver cells are fed by branches of the portal vein, whereas cancer cells in the liver are usually fed by branches of the hepatic artery.

Spiny lobster tails are traditionally grilled and basted with butter. They are also excellent steamed and roasted. Eating Spiny Lobster. From an eating standpoint, most of the meat in a spiny lobster is in its tail. Thaw the Lobster Tails. 1 If the lobster tails are frozen, start by thawing them to room temperature by placing them in a plastic bag and then submerge them in a warm bowl of water. Prepare Basting Sauce. 1 Next create a basting sauce. Melt the butter in a small dish in the microwave, or warm in a small pan and remove from heat. These can be as small as 2 to 3 ounces or as large as a pound in weight, depending on the species and origin of the lobster itself. If you're working from a recipe and purchased the specified size of tails, you can simply follow the recipe's instructions. Otherwise, the usual rule of thumb for lobster tails is one minute of boiling time for every ounce. Four-ounce tails, then, should boil for four minutes, while 10-ounce tails will require 10 minutes.

The last woman as a leader was during the Hapsburg family's dynasty. Maria Theresa (1717-1780). Habsburg Empress, Co-Regent of the Empire. Without male heirs, Charles IV altered Habsburg family law by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, which proclaimed the indivisibility of his lands and designated his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as his successor. Maria Theresa did so many good things for Austria and that is what made her such a great ruler. When Fredrick the Great heard about the death of her, he stated, This woman’s achievements were those of a great man. In 1741, another claimant to the Austrian throne appeared, one Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria, who was elected Charles VII in Frankfurt the following year. Maria Theresa was forced to cede Lower Silesia to Prussia in 1741, then the entire province in 1742.

Putting Florida's cane crop into perspective, prior to the Cuban embargo in 1961 Florida had only 50,000 acres (20,234 hectares) of sugarcane. What is the value of Florida's sugar crop? Recoverable sugar, by weight, has increased from below 10 percent in 1984 to 11.6 percent in 2000-01. In 2004-05, Florida contributed an estimated 51.3% of the cane sugar and 21.4% of the total (from sugarcane and beets combined) sugar produced in the United States. Where does the rest of the sugar produced in the U.S. come from? In the sugar-production process, raw sugar is moved from warehouse to refinery, where the sugar is re-dissolved and refined to obtain the purity required for white sugar crystals. Credits: Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida In 2007-08, Florida contributed an estimated 48 percent of the cane sugar and 24.3 percent of the total (from sugarcane and beets, combined) sugar produced in the United States. In comparison, Florida's 2007-2008 sugarcane crop year yielded 13.3 million U.S. tons (12.1 million metric tons) of stalks and 1.55 million U.S. tons (1.41 million metric tons) of raw sugar. Placing the current size of Florida's sugarcane crop into perspective historically, prior to the Cuban embargo in 1961, Florida had only 50,000 acres (20,234 hectares) of sugarcane. All Florida sugarcane is destined for one of the five sugarcane mills in south Florida. Corporations that grow their own cane and extract the sugar in their own mills produce over 65% of the cane. Independent growers for grower-owned cooperative mills produce another large portion, 25-30%. In 2004, Florida's raw sugar crop was valued at roughly $550 million (http://www.ers.usda.gov/StateFacts/FL.htm ). Most of the fibrous portion of the cane stalks (bagasse) was burned as fuel for the mills and saved an estimated 113 million gallons of fuel oil or 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity. How much sugarcane is grown in Florida? In recent years there has been a slight decline in commercial sugarcane production in Florida. Sugarcane acreage has decreased from a high of 454,400 acres (183,727 hectares) in the 2000-2001crop year to approximately 400,000 acres (161,874 hectares) for the 2004-2005 crop year. The number of farms growing sugar beets declined slightly from 4,022 to 3,913, while average area harvested per farm also rose slightly from 312 to 319 acres. The number of sugarcane farms dropped from 692 to 666, but have fallen from 953 sugarcane farms in the United States in 2002. Sugarcane production. Sugarcane is a crop that can be grown throughout Florida. In many areas of the state, sugarcane is grown only as a hobby crop for syrup production or as a source of chewing cane. However, in South Florida, near Lake Okeechobee, sugarcane is grown commercially for the production of crystal or white sugar. An average stalk, therefore, has about 2.6 pounds (1.2 kilograms) of juice, which is roughly 11 percent sugar by weight. Thus, an average stalk contains about 0.3 pounds (0.14 kilograms) of sugar. Cane sugar and beet sugar are identical in chemistry and quality. Query: how many acres of sugar cane in florida",

            "input": "Average charitable donations by income. The short answer is that the average itemized tax return includes $4,790 in charitable deductions, but that doesn't tell the entire story. First, not everyone who donates to charity can use the charitable deduction. To get the tax break, you need to itemize deductions on your tax return. The IRS has long required taxpayers to subtract the value of anything they receive in return for a charitable contribution before taking a deduction, so someone who gets a $5 tote bag for a $50 donation to a public TV station, for example, can only deduct $45. The national average in 2015 for deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, was $12,471, and sponsors of the new tax law said the $10,000 cap combined with lower rates should protect most Americans from facing a higher tax bill. As a result, nonprofits are pushing Republicans to include something else in their tax plan that they say would increase charitable donations, but keep taxes simple: They want something called a universal charitable deduction, which taxpayers would get on top of the standard deduction. De Leon is proposing that California provide a credit on its state income tax for amounts given to a state charitable fund as a way to get around the part of the new federal tax law that limits deductions for state income taxes but not for charitable contributions. You may deduct charitable contributions of money or property made to qualified organizations if you itemize your deductions. Generally, you may deduct up to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income, but 20 percent and 30 percent limitations apply in some cases. Nonprofits Fear House Republican Tax Bill Would Hurt Charitable Giving Even though Republicans promise to preserve the deduction for charitable donations, nonprofits say other proposed changes in the bill could discourage as much as $13 billion in annual giving. Accessibility links Charitable Contribution Deductions. This article generally explains the rules covering income tax deductions for charitable contributions by individuals. You can find a more comprehensive discussion of these rules in Publication 526, Charitable Contributions, and Publication 561, Determining the Value of Donated Property. For information about the substantiation and disclosure requirements for charitable contributions, see Publication 1771. “The tax benefit of a federal or state charitable contribution is not regarded as a return benefit that negates the charitable intent,” the IRS memo said, citing federal tax court rulings in 1985, 1989, and 1991. Deductions for charitable gifts do not face the same limit as deductions for state and local taxes, a fact California and New Jersey want to exploit. Query: average charitable deduction",

Penicillin G will destroy only a few species of bacteria and is known as a narrow spectrum antibiotic. Tetracycline is effective against a wide range of organisms and is known as a broad spectrum antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance Antibiotic resistance. Bacteria are termed drug-resistant when they are no longer inhibited by an antibiotic to which they were previously sensitive. The emergence and spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria has continued to grow due to both the over-use and misuse of antibiotics. Gram+ cells are only part of the bacterial world. There are many types of harmful bacteria that are Gram-negative. Penicillin does not work against Gram-negative bacteria, since the Gram- cell wall has an extra layer of protection that interferes with the drug reaching the peptidoglydan in Gram-negative bacterial cell walls. Therefore other antibiotics have been developed to work against Gram- cells. Since the introduction of penicillin, a variety of other classes of antibiotics have been discovered and put to use in fighting bacterial infections. Each class of antibiotics has its own mode of action or MOA. The mode of action is specifically how the drug works to disable or kill bacteria. Friendly bacteria help keep you healthy in many ways, so when antibiotics kill friendly bacteria, your health can suffer because you lose these benefits. Additionally, losing friendly bacteria can give other types of bacteria room to multiply, leading to opportunistic infection. Antibiotics are medications used specifically to kill or disable bacteria. All bacteria are prokaryotic. organisms, meaning that their cells are different than cells of the human body. These differences can be exploited, so that antibiotic drugs can kill bacteria without harming us. Most of the bacterial world falls into one of two categories, Gram+ and Gram-, based on Article Summary: Antibiotics are drugs used to fight bacterial infections. Although there are similarities between bacteria and human cells, there are many differences as well. Antibiotics work by affecting things that bacterial cells have but human cells don’t. For example, human cells do not have cell walls, while many types of bacteria do. The antibiotic penicillin works by keeping a bacterium from building a cell wall. Bacteria and human cells also differ in the structure of their cell membranes and the machinery they use to build proteins or copy DNA. Antibiotics kill bacteria, not archaea, fungi, or protists. The discovery of the antibiotic penicillin in the 1920s made a big impact on human history. Not only did it lead to a cure for bacterial infections that were once deadly, but it also led a big interest in finding new antibiotics. The effects of the antibiotic drug ceftazidine on Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The antibiotic kills the bacteria (red) by causing the cell wall to disintegrate (yellow remnants). Antibiotics are chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria and are used to treat bacterial infections. They are produced in nature by soil bacteria and fungi. This gives the microbe an advantage when competing for food and water and other limited resources in a particular habitat, as the antibiotic kills off their competition. How do antibiotics work Antibiotics take advantage of the difference between the structure of the bacterial cell and the host’s cell. They either prevent the bacterial cells from multiplying so that the bacterial population remains the same, allowing the host’s defence mechanism to fight the infection or kill the bacteria, for example stopping the mechanism responsible for building their cell walls.

Generally speaking, the closer natural gas gets to a customer, the smaller the pipe diameter is and the lower the pressure is. The gas utility's central control center continuously monitors flow rates and pressures at various points in its system. The critical temperature of a gas is the temperature at or above which no amount of pressure, however great, will cause the gas to liquefy. The minimum pressure required to liquefy the gas at the critical temperature is called the critical pressure. For example, the critical temperature for carbon dioxide is 88°F (31°C). That means that no amount of pressure applied to a sample of carbon dioxide gas at or above 88°F will cause the gas to liquefy. Aside from the machinery used to compress the gas and the energy used to drive that machinery, essentially no CO2 is produced. Natural gas at the well head is at high pressure …, in order to liquefy it it needs to be compressed to about 50 atmospheres and cooled by running it through condensers to release the heat of compression.

Gases, liquefaction of. Liquefaction of gases is the process by which a gas is converted to a liquid. For example, oxygen normally occurs as a gas. However, by applying sufficient amounts of pressure and by reducing the temperature by a sufficient amount, oxygen can be converted to a liquid. How Does the Natural Gas Delivery System Work? How Does the Natural Gas Delivery System Work? Gas flowing from higher to lower pressure is the fundamental principle of the natural gas delivery system. The amount of pressure in a pipeline is measured in pounds per square inch.

I like to boil my ribs before slathering them in BBQ sauce and then toss them on the grill. :d How many people boil their ribs before tossing them on the grill? Yes, we love and eat beef short ribs as much and often as the next guy does. But, this plate is wildly different. On the outside, the ribs look as enticing as you’d expect any good short rib dishes to. Bafflement begins when you cut into the rib. Suddenly, you start questioning your senses: You feel as though your knife is running through some very tender cut, not unlike prime ribs. Place the short ribs in the pan and add 2 cups of water. The water should almost completely cover the meat. Add the thyme and bay leaves, cover the pan, and cook in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Check on the meat periodically, adding more water if necessary. Turn the ribs over halfway through. Cook's notes: Recipe calls for 6 to 8 hours in a low oven (250 degrees). Call ahead to your butcher two days or more in advance if you want boneless short ribs. If you prefer, select bone-in variety, but when you order, take into account waste (bone, excess fat). Preliminaries: Heat oven to 250 degrees. In a stockpot, bring 6 quarts water to a boil. Stir in 1 cup each sugar and coarse salt until dissolved. Add smashed unpeeled cloves from 1 head garlic and meat; boil until cooked through and tender at bone, 20 minutes for chicken, 30 minutes for pork ribs, and 40 minutes for beef ribs. You don't need to boil spareribs before grilling because you can make tender, juicy, delicious ribs without boiling them. Many grilling and barbecue enthusiasts will tell you the length of time you should boil ribs before cooking is zero minutes. Some cooks prefer to boil ribs before cooking and a typical time, with the ribs fully submerged in salted water, is around 45 minutes to an hour on a medium-low simmer. While boiling does have some advantages over straight grilling, it has a significant downside. But as an avid cook, my challenge is to streamline a professional recipe to something simple and convenient enough to make at home whenever I have a craving for those delicious short ribs. I’ve found that cooking them in the oven at a low temperature of 190 degrees Fahrenheit for just eight hours yields some very tender and juicy meat that somewhat resembles what I tasted at Julienne. How to Cook Ribs in the Oven. When cooking ribs in the oven, place ribs on rack of a broiler pan.

LASIK surgery is an extremely effective procedure with very little recovery time. While there is no set time for how long it will take your vision to fully stabilize, results are seen almost immediately. If you are interested in LASIK surgery, contact your doctor to see if you are a candidate. Read on as Lakewood Ophthalmologist Dr. Edward Hedaya of InVision EyeCare explains how long LASIK/PRK surgery takes. A Quick (and Comfortable) Surgery. LASIK and PRK are outpatient procedures, so patients can have surgery and go home on the same day. From start to finish, the LASIK and PRK procedures take about 10 to 15 minutes. But the actual laser needs mere seconds to reshape the cornea to correct vision. What to Expect on the Day of Your Surgery. What to expect on the day of your surgery primarily depends on your choice in surgeon and surgery center. Before Surgery. If you decide to go ahead with LASIK surgery, you will need an initial or baseline evaluation by your eye doctor to determine if you are a good candidate. This is what you need to know to prepare for the exam and what you should expect: You should see your doctor within the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery and at regular intervals after that for at least the first six months. At the first postoperative visit, your doctor will remove the eye shield, test your vision, and examine your eye. One of the main concerns about any surgery is how long it will take to recover. With LASIK, the recovery is simple and relatively easy. We’ll walk you through the recovery process so you can see exactly what to expect after. Immediately After Surgery. Following the surgery, your doctor will likely give you protective eye shields or sunglasses to wear to protect your eyes as they heal. LASIK surgery takes very little time. The entire procedure for both eyes is usually completed within 15 minutes. The first step of LASIK – creating the corneal flap – may take longer that the laser reshaping of the eye (step two). If the flap is created with a microkeratome, this step takes only a few seconds. But if it's created with a femtosecond laser (in an all-laser LASIK procedure), it may a minute or two. In most cases, the laser reshaping of the eye takes less than a minute. The time for LASIK versus PRK procedures are similar. During the first few months after surgery, your vision may fluctuate. 1  It may take up to three to six months for your vision to stabilize after surgery. 2  Glare, haloes, difficulty driving at night, and other visual symptoms may also persist during this stabilization period. If you wear contact lenses, it is a good idea to stop wearing them before your baseline evaluation and switch to wearing your glasses full-time. 1  Contact lenses change the shape of your cornea for up to several weeks after you have stopped using them depending on the type of contact lenses you wear. Your doctor should perform a thorough eye exam and discuss: 1  whether you are a good candidate. 2  what the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery are. 3  what you should expect before, during, and after surgery. 4  what your responsibilities will be before, during, and after surgery.

Remember, too, your security deposit isn’t the limit of your liability. While you’re entitled to get some or all of your security deposit back—if you've done little or no damage—if the amount of damage exceeds the amount of your deposit, the landlord can bill—or even sue—you to recover the remaining damages. Does my landlord have to show me receipts for damage repairs deducted from my deposit or charged to me? What is “normal wear and tear”? If the landlord gave me a written lease, a complete move-in checklist, and a specific written statement within 21 days, does this prevent me from requesting my deposit back or disputing the charges? Are you ever going to see it again? Does it mean you don’t have to pay your last month’s rent? What is a security deposit? A security deposit is a fixed amount of money you pay your landlord, or management company, to cover any damage you might cause to the property. The landlord can’t spend that money while you live in the apartment. The new law, which goes into effect January 15, 2017, requires landlords to charge no more than 1 month’s rent for security deposit and nonrefundable fees. Additionally, tenants are allowed up to a 6 month payment plan for the security deposit, any nonrefundable fees, and last month’s rent. How long does the landlord have to return my deposit? RCW 59.18.280 states that the landlord has 21 days from the time the rental agreement ends and the tenant vacates the unit to postmark the return of the deposit or a written statement detailing why portions of the deposit were withheld. The correspondence must be postmarked by the 21st day. The landlord sends you an itemized list of damages and repair costs, along with any remaining balance on your security deposit; When you move out, be sure to give your landlord your new address. They are legally required to send you an itemized list of damages and the balance of your security deposit within a certain time period, but they can’t do that if they don't know where to find you.

            "input": "The way you breastfeed changes as your baby grows. Exclusively breastfed newborns should be put to the breast on demand, at least every two to three hours throughout the day and night. At two months, your child may be able to go a little longer between feedings, and he may even sleep for a longer stretch at night. Exclusive breastfeeding Ten things you may not know about exclusive breastfeeding Every mother who chooses to exclusively breastfeed her baby in the first 6 months is doing the best thing she can to help her baby grow and stay healthy Not all breastfeeding is equal and the differences are important: Exclusive breastfeeding: breastmilk only - nothing else. 1  Mixed feeding: adding anything else - water, juice, tea, formula, cereals, baby foods or other foods. Mixed feeding can increase the chances of a child getting infections. WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional needs. Women have been breastfeeding for as long as they have been having babies. For thousands of years, breastfeeding (also known as lactation, nursing, and suckling) was the only way for a mother to feed her baby, and it was necessary for a child's survival. Then, in the early 1900s, an alternative to breastfeeding was developed. Q: Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed? A:Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as giving no other food or drink – not even water – except breast milk. 1 Breastfeeding Along With Complementary Foods: Breastfeeding along with the addition of solid foods is called complementary feeding. Complementary foods are often added to a child's diet between four and six months of age. 2  Comfort Nursing: Breastfeeding is about so much more than just nutrition. As infant formula became safer, more women began to choose bottle feeding formula over breastfeeding. 1  Over the next few decades, breastfeeding became less and less popular, and by the 1960s breastfeeding rates were at an all-time low. But in the 1970s, breastfeeding rates began to rise slowly. Breastfeeding Recommendations. Breastfeeding is the recommended way to feed newborns and infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises mothers to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life and then to breastfeed along with adding solid foods to a baby's diet for at least one year. After one year, the AAP states that a mother and her child can continue with breastfeeding for as long as they both wish to do so. The World Health Organization (WHO) urges exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, with the continuation of breastfeeding along with solid foods for two years or longer. Working mothers can continue exclusive breastfeeding by expressing breastmilk at work and at home. Expressed milk should be left covered in a clean container in a cool place, to be fed from a cup while the mother is away. Expressed breastmilk will last 8-10 hours out of the fridge, and 3 days in a fridge. When the mother returns home, she should breastfeed the baby often through the night. Depending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered ¾ to full 250 ml cup/bowl a Note: If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1–2 cups of milk per day, and 1–2 extra meals per day.

            "input": "How does it work? The Senate generally operates by unanimous consent. If any senators refuse to consent to holding an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, the Senate has to decide whether to overrule them. It would do so by holding a “cloture” vote on whether to end debate and proceed to a final vote. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch is now going to the Senate floor. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, has pledged to lead Democrats in a filibuster of the nomination. If he does, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has vowed to change Senate rules to clear the way for Judge Gorsuch. The potential showdown has raised interest in the peculiar Senate filibuster rule. But because a cloture process is often required to end debate on a bill, then the bill first must garner the support of a three-fifths supermajority. All told, this process of reaching a final vote on a bill can require about a week of Senate floor time to complete. Senate Rule XXII, often called the cloture rule, does allow a supermajority to limit debate on a bill, amendment, or motion; in addition, in the case of a bill, cloture limits the amendments that can be offered. Supporters of, for instance, a bill under floor consideration can file a cloture motion, signed by at least 16 Senators. What is cloture? Cloture — a process for limiting debate on a measure — is the Senate’s only weapon against the filibuster. The details have changed several times since its creation a century ago, but here’s the rule as it stands today: cloture is invoked when three-fifths of all sworn-in senators vote for the cloture motion. The Senate nearly always has 100 members, putting the magic number at 60. In other words, the cloture vote is the stand-off between a filibustering minority and an annoyed majority. If at least 60 senators vote Yea, the filibuster ends. If fewer than 60 vote Yea, the filibuster continues. In both cases, the side that “loses” has no further weapons to fight with. Left-leaning political blogger Matthew Yglesias has argued for eliminating the filibuster in two articles: “ 1 Failure Buster,” The American Prospect, April 2005. “ 2 The Silenced Majority,” The Atlantic, December 2008. How many members of the Senate does it take to end cloture? Cloture is a limited debate, and must be voted in motion by at least 60 members (3/5ths) of the Senate, after a petition calling for the action is submitted by at least 16 members. What are the qualifications to be in the House of Representatives? Hold up action on a bill by refusing to yield the floor, gives individual senators a degree of influence over legislation that is not available to the members of the House, whose debate is governed by a more restrictive set of rules. 60 votes in the Senate are required to invoke cloture and end a filibuster. Serve as a link between the majority party's leadership and its rank and party members. They check with party members and tell the floor leader which members, and how many votes , can be counted on in any particular matter. They also see that all members of the party are present for important votes and that they vote with the party leadership. They report to the floor leaders. But rather than relying on the formal rules like cloture, frequently the Senate can more effectively act using unanimous consent agreements. Such an agreement is a structured plan for limiting debate and amending – a plan that can be tailored to each bill that comes to the floor (somewhat akin to a special rule in the House).

But the chance of recurrence is low, and you may never have another cyst again after your initial surgery. Injections for Synovial Cysts. There are two types of injections that can be helpful to alleviate the pain: facet injections or epidural injections. Facet injection. The facet joint can be entered with a small needle, and occasionally the cyst can be drained by aspirating it through the joint. What advances are there in surgery to treat ovarian cysts and what are the benefits over other procedures? Laparoscopic surgery is very effective for removing masses, such as ovarian cysts. Benign (non-cancerous) cysts can usually be removed, while preserving the ovary. Self-removal of facial cysts at home is not recommended, because the cyst will grow back if not completely removed. Chances of infection, bleeding, and other complications increase for people who remove dermoid cysts themselves, especially because the person may not be able to differentiate between a harmless growth and other, more serious skin growths. Sebaceous cysts generally do not require medical treatment. However, if they continue to grow, they may become unsightly, painful, infected, or all of the above. Surgical. Surgical excision of a sebaceous cyst is a simple procedure to completely remove the sac and its contents. A healthcare professional can determine whether a lump is a cyst or tumor. A simple ultrasound scan placed against the skin will allow the healthcare professional to see whether the lump appears solid or hollow and filled with fluid. If the lump is fluid-filled, it may require no treatment at all. The doctor performs the surgery by guiding endoscopic instruments through the sleeve into the kidney. Under X-ray control, the cyst is opened, and a large portion of the wall is removed. This procedure usually requires an overnight stay in the hospital. Laparoscopy and Cyst Removal Laparoscopy and cyst removal is the treatment of choice for most patients with numerous or very large cysts. The laparoscopic approach is best for removing a large number of cysts and for those with a condition called adult polycystic kidney disease (APCKD). Hence, it is a cluster of cells that has grouped together to form a sac (not unlike the manner in which water molecules group together, forming a bubble); however, the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the shell of such a sac are distinctly abnormal (in both appearance and behaviour) when compared with all surrounding cells ... Ovarian cysts can be small or grow very large. They can cause intense pain, especially if they twist or rupture. Some ovarian masses can be cancerous, so it's important to see a GYN specialist for a full evaluation. Symptoms of ovarian cysts can also include: 1  Bloating or swelling in the abdomen. 2  Pain during bowel movements. 3  Pain in the pelvis shortly before or after beginning a menstrual period. 4  Pain with intercourse or pelvic pain during movement. 5  Pelvic pain -- constant, dull aching.

(In fact, Neptune is currently the farthest planet from the Sun‹since the early 1970s, Pluto has been closer to the Sun than Neptune has, and it will remain so until the end of this century.) * At this distance, Neptune receives nearly 1,000 times less sunlight than Earth, and about two and one-half times less than Uranus, but its overall temperature is about the same as that of Uranus. 1,500-M.P.H. Winds Found on Neptune THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AN FRANCISCO -- Neptune is swept by 1,500 mile-an-hour winds, the fastest yet discovered in the solar system, scientists have determined from analyzing photographs taken by Voyager 2. It is estimated that the wind speed on Neptune could exceed 2,000 mph. Also, It's estimated to 1,000 miles to 2,000 miles. It is estimated that the wind speed on Neptune could exceed 2,000 mph. Also, It's estimated to 1,000 miles to 2,000 miles. The scientists discovered the winds blow in relatively thin weather layers no more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) deep on both planets. For comparison, Neptune is about 30,600 miles (49,250 km) in diameter, while Uranus is approximately 31,500 miles (50,700 km) wide. These findings help reveal how these winds originate, researchers said. Quick Answer. Neptune takes 19 hours to complete its spin. It takes 165 Earth years to make one orbit around the sun, which equates to one year on Neptune. Neptune is the eighth planet in the solar system, and it is at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles from the sun. Nothing on Jupiter remains the same. In terms of size growth, it can't really grow in latitude, as it is bound by Jupiter's zonal winds. That can change slightly, and it could expand in longitude, though we haven't seen them ever really do that (both the GRS and predecessor ovals have shrunk in longitudinal extent over the years). Started wondering about the speed of sound on Neptune when I heard winds there can reach in excess of 1500+ mph, well above Earth's speed of sound. According to this report, the speed of sound could range from 600-740 m/s or 1350-1650 mph on Neptune. What happens when wind speed break the sound barrier? Would these storms create a sonic boom effect? May 17, 2013. This image of Neptune was taken during the August 16-17, 1989, period as Voyager 2 photographed the planet almost continuously, but had no way to measure the winds or how deep they reach into the atmosphere. Now, scientists have turned to subtle changes in the planet's gravity for clues. Best Answer: Neptune also has 2,500 km/h winds of hydrogen, helium, and methane that gives the planet its blue appearance. Neptune weather is characterized by extremely violent hurricanes, whose winds reach 1,000 mph. winds on neptune blow 10 times than the earth's (or 700 m/second), in fact, neptune has the great dark spot in which storms whirls like swirling clouds. hadouken07 · 1 decade ago 0 Query: how fast can the winds on neptune",

A: When handled properly, cut onions are not poisonous. After being cut, onions can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 7 days. A widely circulated claim states uncooked, leftover onions are 'poisonous' because they're 'a huge magnet for bacteria,' thus likely to spoilage. This claim stems from a blog post that dates back to March 2008. Another option is to caramelize one or two onions in a frying pan, and then freeze the pre-cooked onions in smaller portions. (I tend not to like cooking with frozen onions, since the extra water will steam the onions rather than allow them to cook at the higher temperature you could achieve without the extra water. I've had good luck with sealed glass containers ... including when storing sliced or diced onions.

Subjects chose actions like running 15 minutes before dinner, eating a piece of fruit with lunch, or meditating. The median length of time it took for a habit to become automatic was 66 days. The range, however, was 18 to 254 days for the habit to be established. In fact, about half of the subjects did not perform their chosen action consistently enough to create a habit. Interestingly, increased repetition of an action does not always yield stronger habits. To successfully break a habit, you need to think of your strongest motivation, which will drive you along. Think of a 'replacement behaviour' for the habit, but make sure it’s a positive one - replacing smoking with snacking is a common trap, for example. And be patient. The longer you’ve had a habit, the longer it will take to get rid of it. For some, habits formed in as little as 18 days and for others it took as long as 254 days. There are of course obvious flaws in the study; the numbers are self-reported and it was only 96 participants in the study. Missing a single day did not reduce the chance of forming a habit. A sub-group took much longer than the others to form their habits, perhaps suggesting some people are ‘habit-resistant’. Other types of habits may well take much longer. No small change But for the rest of your life, you will have developed the habit of not putting your hand on hot stoves, or touching live electrical wires.

It’s not just me saying this either; there is science to support it too. 1  In 2006, Verplanken (6) gave students one of two writing tasks. The first group simply had to underline ‘She/she’ every time they came across it in a piece of text. So how long does it take to change your life – or at least, to adopt a new habit? There is a myth that has lingered since the 1960s that it takes 21 days to change a habit or to adopt a new one. And just like that, we have the 21 day rule of habit development. When you dig into the science, it paints a different picture though, and in reality just like I’ve pointed in the loopholes above, there’s much more to it than the 21 day rule suggests.

These are the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain, also known as the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon respectively. Five secondary structures from these in the seventh gestational week. Worse, teens' brains make them much more vulnerable to becoming addicted than a fully developed adult brain. The part of the teen brain not yet fully developed is the frontal lobe, which is the part of the brain that manages impulse control, judgment, insight, and emotional control. So when teens engage in risky and/or foolish behavior, it's not just that they don't have life experience to know better, but that their brains have difficulty assessing consequences. Brain diagram. Credit: dwp.gov.uk. (PhysOrg.com) -- New research from the UK shows the brain continues to develop after childhood and puberty, and is not fully developed until people are well into their 30s and 40s. The findings contradict current theories that the brain matures much earlier. When we think about brain development and plasticity, most of us think about the birth and death of neurons or changes in the number or strength of synapses. Yet, no part of the brain works in isolation. Brain maturation and plasticity also depends upon the large nerve fiber tracts that connect different brain regions together. The limitations of the teen brain has been well publicized in the mass media, helping parents, teachers, and others understand why it may be difficult for teens to meet our expectations and demands for managing emotions, handling risks, responding to relationships, and engaging in complex school work or employment. The results are consistent with other research suggesting that the human brain continues to grow and mature right up to the point when we become adults and even beyond. In another study, researchers found that humans don't really develop the ability to handle multiple pieces of information at once until about the ages of 16 or 17. In a recent paper in the Journal of Neuroscience (link is external), investigators described a study in which they monitored white matter changes in 103 healthy human subjects, ages 5 to 32 years. For each subject, they imaged the brain at least twice with an average period of four years between scans. Some tracts, such as sections of the corpus callosum, appeared to reach maturity during adolescence, but, in about 50 % of the older subjects, the association fiber tracts continued to mature. Brain changes significantly after age 18, says Dartmouth research. Dartmouth College Office of Public Affairs • Press Release. Posted 02/06/06 • Contact Susan Knapp (603) 646-3661. Two Dartmouth researchers are one step closer to defining exactly when human maturity sets in. In a study aimed at identifying how and when a person's brain reaches adulthood, the scientists have learned that, anatomically, significant changes in brain structure continue after age 18. A fetus is a stage in the prenatal development of viviparous organisms. In human development, a fetus or foetus (/ˈfiːtəs/; plural fetuses or foetuses) is a prenatal human between the embryonic state and birth. The fetal stage of development tends to be taken as beginning at the gestational age of eleven weeks, i.e. nine weeks after fertilization. A control group of 17 older students, ranging in age from 25 to 35, were also studied for comparison. The results indicate that significant changes took place in the brains of these individuals. The changes were localized to regions of the brain known to integrate emotion and cognition. Query: at what age is the human brain fully formed",

Dr. Troy Madsen says food poisoning generally takes about six hours to take effect, but most people get through it all right. Learn about the symptoms of food poisoning and things you can do to help yourself get through it.> Depends. There are many different causes of food poisoning, e.g., chemicals, bacterial toxins, live micro-organisms etc. However, once the poisoning has abated, it is okay to take a healthy diet rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, beans, legumes, lentils; and low in saturated fats. It is important to avoid dehydation so liquids are a must. After the diarrhea stops, go back slowly over a 24 hour time span using toast, fruits.Avoid vegetables, nuts and legumes for a few days after food poisoning since their high-fiber content makes them difficult to digest, and they can cause gas. Spicy foods and sauces can also aggravate. ... The foregoing information is based on recommendations from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA), working with the Partnership for Food Safety Education. Food : Food poisoning is a common condition that results in more than 75 million episodes occur annually in the United States. Close to one in five episodes of diarrhea is likely to be due to a food-borne disease. Harmful bacteria can be transferred from food to people, from people to food, or from one food to another. Bacteria can grow rapidly at room temperature: As temperature rises, growth rate increases. Growth of most harmful bacteria in food can be slowed or stopped by refrigeration or freezing. So if some sort of food poisoning, or something I believe to be food poisoning, hits, you know, it's the six hours later after I ate something, maybe it was even at a restaurant, should I automatically be worried, or will my body kind of take care of it? How soon after eating contaminated food do symptoms occur? There are many forms of food-related illness.

Does Leaf Surface Area Affect the Rate of Transpiration in a Plant? Aim: The aim of my investigation is to find out if the leaf surface area affects the rate of transpiration in a plant. Variables: The variables of this experiment are;- * The leaf surface area * Temperature of the surrounding air * The speed and amount of wind * The amount of light Environmental Factors: Temperature of air The temperature of the air affects the rate of transpiration. Where S=the number of stomata, E=total number of epidermal cells in a unit area of the leaf. Oats contain 54,000 per one square inch, but cucumber contains 428,000 per square inch. A study on stomatal index of leaves at different positions and different areas in the same leaf and plant provides very interesting information about the structure, frequency, distribution and ultimately their function. Water is transpired through stomata, but carbon dioxide also must pass through stomata into a leaf for. photosynthesis to occur. There is evidence that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has not. always been the same over the history of life on Earth. How to Calculate Leaf Surface Area. The rate of transpiration is measured as the amount of water lost/ square meter/ minute. Because water evaporates through the many stomata on the leaf surface, the rate of transpiration is directly related to the surface area. To arrive at the rate of transpiration, therefore, you must calculate the leaf surface area of each plant: Because most stomata are found in the lower epidermis, you will determine that surface area. 1  Lay the leaves to be measured on a 1-cm grid and trace their outlines. 2  Count the number of square centimeters. To investigate the relationship among leaf surface area, number of stomata, and the rate of transpiration learning objective 2: To design and conduct an experiment to explore other factors, including different environmental variables, on the rate of transpiration Perhaps there are the same number of stomata on a small leaf as on a large leaf and the space between the stomata increases as the leaf grows. Perhaps larger leaves have more stomata and more stomata are formed in the spaces as a leaf gets bigger. Each of these hypotheses could lead you to a different prediction of the rate of transpiration per cm2 in large compared with small leaves. We would be interested to know how your experiments go. This is an adaptation to check excessive transpiration in these plants. Number of Stomata (Stomatal Frequency): The number of stomata in a definite area of leaf varies from plant to plant. Xerophytes possess larger number of stomata than mesophytes. Number of stomata/sq cm. is 1000 — 60,000 in different plant species. The number of stomta per unit area of leaf is called Stomatal Frequency. Stomata frequency of trees and shrubs is higher than herbs. Stomata nearly occupy one to two percent of total leaf area when fully open. Is there any relationship between the number of stomata and the environment in which the plant species evolved? • Are leaf surface area and the number of stomata related to the rate of transpiration? What might happen to the rate of transpiration if the number of leaves or the size of leaves is reduced? • Do all parts of a plant transpire? Transpiration is a physiological phenomenon in which water is lost from certain surfaces of the plant body in the form of water vapors. This process is essential for the upward movement of water and mineral nutrients. Query: how does the number of stomata in a leaf relate to the rate of transpiration",

After graduation, ... Certification is not required for physicians and surgeons; however, it may increase their employment opportunities. M.D.s and D.O.s seeking board certification in a specialty may spend up to 7 years in residency training; the length of time varies with the specialty. That residency, which typically involves grueling 80-hour workweeks, is required even if a doctor previously did a residency in a country with an advanced medical system, like Britain or Japan. The only exception is for doctors who did their residencies in Canada. The following specialists are some of the most common examples: 1  Allergists (specialists in diagnosing and treating hay fever or other allergies) 2  Cardiologists (heart specialists) 3  Dermatologists (skin specialists) 4  Gastroenterologists (digestive system specialists) 5  Ophthalmologists (eye specialists) A residency is like a job, and the resident generally works normal hours depending on the particular setting, gets a salary or stipend, has holidays and personal time off, and benefits like health insurance. So again, internship is simply the first year of residency. Residency can be anywhere from 2 more to 6 more years, depending on the specialty you choose. Many super-specialties have further training after residency, called fellowship - these can be 1 to 3 years in length.

How Long Does Medical Residency Training Last? Medical residency is a minimum of three years for primary care physicians and some other specialties, up to five years for some surgical specialties. (Some medical specialties require additional years of fellowship training in addition to the three to five years of residency training.) General Internists serve as primary care physicians, along with family medicine doctors and pediatricians. The biggest difference between Family Medicine and Internal Medicine is that IM training focuses on adults, with residents spending time between various adult medicine subspecialties. What We Do.

            "input": "Signs and symptoms of autism in babies and toddlers. If autism is caught in infancy, treatment can take full advantage of the young brain’s remarkable plasticity. Although autism is hard to diagnose before 24 months, symptoms often surface between 12 and 18 months. If signs are detected by 18 months of age, intensive treatment may help to rewire the brain and reverse the symptoms. If you notice any of these signs or have concerns about your child's development, talk with his doctor. Signs of autism in babies younger than 12 months old. At this age, picking up on signs of autism involves paying attention to whether your child is meeting developmental milestones. Here are some things to watch for: Doesn't show interest in faces. Doesn't make eye contact, doesn't smile, and may even seem to look right through you. Does My Child Have Autism? Recognizing the Early Signs and Symptoms of Autism. As a parent, you never want to believe that your precious bundle has a problem. But when it comes to autism, catching it early—ideally by the age of eighteen months—makes a huge difference. But no matter your child's age, don't lose hope. It's important to note that, unlike kids with autism, those with AS might show no delays in language development; they usually have good grammar skills and an advanced vocabulary at an early age. However, many do have a language disorder — for instance, a child might be very literal and have trouble using language in a social context. For parents, the first months after learning that their child has a developmental disorder can be emotional, confusing and challenging. For this reason, Autism Speaks has developed the 100 Day Tool Kit, to help families navigate the often-tumultuous first 100 days after a child’s diagnosis. Knowing you have autism may help you understand why you may feel differently or see yourself as being different but it doesn’t have to define you.” Your provider can help with this discussion with your child so ask if you are unsure of where to start or if you are having difficulty describing autism as anything but a disability. We hope this helps give you some ideas on when and how to talk with your child about having an autism diagnosis. Finally, get information and support from credible organizations like Autism Speaks, the Autism Science Foundation, and the Autism Society. If there’s one thing that the statistics tell us, it’s that families with autistic children are not alone. Autism Speaks' multi-year Ad Council public service advertising campaign stresses the importance of recognizing the early signs of autism and seeking early intervention services. Recent research confirms that appropriate screening can determine whether a child is at risk for autism as young as one year. The most recent statistics show that 1 in 68 children are now being diagnosed with autism. While diagnosis is on the rise, a child typically is not diagnosed by a professional until he or she is over two years old. However, there are signs that could indicate your child is on the spectrum as early as six months of age. Signs and symptoms can vary, as can the severity of the symptoms. Be sure to monitor your child’s development, and consult your doctor if anything concerns you. It’s important to note that autism in infants can be recognized by a lack of normal behavior, rather than the presence of strange behaviors. 9. Lack of smiling Rather than describe autism as a disability, think of it as a way to describe the way your child’s brain works. Point out the strengths of having a brain that works this way – “You have a great memory” or “You see details that others miss”. There is no right age to tell your child – it’s more a matter of right developmental level. Kindergarten and 1st grade are a time when kids start to see differences and hear descriptive words to describe or group kids such as the kids who are “busy”, “shy”, “active”.

How to take proguanil with atovaquone. 1  Before you take proguanil with atovaquone, read the manufacturer's printed information leaflet from inside the pack. 2  You should start taking the tablets 1 or 2 days before you enter the area which has malaria. This is to ensure there is sufficient medicine in your bloodstream to give you the required protection. Take one dose each day throughout your stay, and then continue to take one dose a day for a further seven days after you leave the area. There are two strengths of tablets: 250 mg/100 mg tablets which are suitable for adults and children weighing more than 40 kg, and 62.5 mg /25 mg tablets which are suitable for children weighing between 11 kg and 40 kg: Others include wearing suitable clothing, using insect repellents and sleeping in screened rooms or beds. It is important that you take these tablets for one or two days before you travel, during the whole of your stay, and for seven days after you return. If you need to take a medicine for indigestion (such as an antacid), do not take it during the two hours before you take proguanil with atovaquone, or during the two hours after you take it. This is because some magnesium-containing antacids interfere with the way one of the medicines (proguanil) is absorbed by your body, making it less effective. The dose for a child weighing 21-31 kg is two 62.5 mg/25 mg tablets daily. The dose for a child weighing 11-21 kg is one 62.5 mg/25 mg tablet daily. Where possible, take the tablets with a snack or a milky drink and try to take your doses at about the same time of day, each day.

            "input": "It takes light 8.3 minutes (on average, depending on Earth's location in its orbit) to get from the sun's surface to Earth. Heat is another form of electromagnetic radiation (just like light), it takes the same amount of time. it takes 500 seconds or 8m 20s for light from the suns surface to reach earth's surface. heat is the random motion of atoms. when the sun shines it's rays down on earth (elecromagnetic radiation) the atoms absorb this energy and the energy levels of an atom are raised thus creating higher temperatures. Sunlight travels at the speed of light. Photons emitted from the surface of the Sun need to travel across the vacuum of space to reach our eyes. The short answer is that it takes sunlight an average of 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. If the Sun suddenly disappeared from the Universe (not that this could actually happen, don’t panic), it would take a little more than 8 minutes before you realized it was time to put on a sweater. Divide these and you get 500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds. This is an average number. Remember, the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, ranging from 147 million to 152 million km. At its closest point, sunlight only takes 490 seconds to reach Earth. And then at the most distant point, it takes 507 seconds for sunlight to make the journey. But the story of light gets even more interesting, when you think about the journey light needs to make inside the Sun. Light moves at 186,000 miles a second and the Sun is 93,000,000 miles away. Do the math. (500 seconds or 8 1/3 minutes) Heat is energy. Heat from the Sun is brought to Earth in the light from the Sun. Sunlight is absorbed by things it strikes, like the ground, and the energy of the light becomes heat energy in the thing that absorbed it. How long does it take the sun's light to reach earth? Asked by: CITO GASTON Answer The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies because the Earth's orbit about the Sun is elliptical.At it's closest, the distance is 91,402,000 miles and it's farthest distance it is 94,512,000 miles.This gives an average distance of 92,957,000 miles.

At its closest point, sunlight only takes 490 seconds to reach Earth. And then at the most distant point, it takes 507 seconds for sunlightto make the journey. Imagine the sun to be a spherical gun shooting photons in all directions. These photons travel at the speed of light in straight lines, and can be characterised as 'rays of light'. What it means to say that light takes approx. 8 minutes to reach the earth from the sun is that these photons take approx. 8 minutes to travel the distance between the earth and the sun at their speed (the speed of light). Why does it take 20,000 years for light to reach the surface of the Sun from its core, but just 8 minutes to reach the surface of the Earth? How long does it take for sunlight to reach earth?

            "input": "by Jerry Search, Southern California Speed Skating Association. From an article originally appearing in The Racing Blade, November 1994: For many years I have heard various statements of the actual speed in miles per hour (MPH) that speed skaters skate, anywhere from 20 to 40 MPH. Long Track Speedskating Preview The U.S. and long track speedskating are synonymous. Boasting 67 Olympic medals, including 29 golds, Team USA is traditionally poised to reach the medal stand each Olympic Winter Games due to the team’s historic success. And remember that the stop-and-go tactics of pack-style skating also influence times, and true speed. Therefore... If you have the opportunity to have timed flying 1-laps, then this would be your fastest true speed (although you could probably skate a little faster in a long track straight-away sprint of maybe 100 meters). The Olympic long track competition will be held at the Gangneung Oval, which is situated next to the short track speedskating venue in the coastal city of Gangneung. The venue seats up to 8,000 people and also hosted the 2017 ISU World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships in February 2017. Short track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink, on a 111.12 m oval track. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic individual race being 1500 meters (the women's relay is 3000 meters and the men's relay 5000 meters). Most speed skating races are held on an oval course, but there are exceptions. Oval sizes vary; in short track speed skating, the rink must be an oval of 111.12 metres, while long track speed skating uses a similarly standardized 400 m rink. Inline skating rinks are between 125 and 400 metres, though banked tracks can only be 250 metres long. Before you use the Speed Calculator, please keep in mind two very important points. First, in Short Track speed skating, the skaters rarely skate the actual measured distance on the track, usually skating a somewhat wider track, and therefore farther than the measured 111.12 meters per lap. If you cannot get a flying lap timed, just enter your best time in a short race, like a 333 (300 for Long Track) or a 500. Just to answer the big question of How fast can a speedskater really skate?, try entering the current (2001) 500 meter World Record for Long Track, 34.32. The long track speed skating track is more than three times the length of the short track. Speed skating is broken up into 12 events at the Olympics for both men and women. Men compete at distances of 500 meters, 1,000 meters, 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and a team event. Speed skating. The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long, but tracks of 200, 250 and 333⅓ meters are used occasionally. It is one of two Olympic forms of the sport and the one with the longer history.

In developing countries, many women and children start their day by walking an average distance of 6 kilometres to collect water for their families. This consumes 200 million daily work hours, a loss of productivity greater than the combined hours worked in a week by employees at six of the biggest multinational corporations including Walmart, McDonald's, and IBM.

            "input": "A wind turbine works on a simple principle. This animation shows how energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity. Wind turbines are mounted on a tower to capture the most energy. Most people think of generating electricity with wind turbines when the subject is wind energy. There are many other ways we can harness the kinetic energy in the wind (also known as motional energy). The energy in the wind has been used in sailboats for thousands of years. Midwest Rural Energy Council Wind turbines generate electrical power in the same way as all other generation technologies. The only difference is in the source of the mechanical power supplied to the electrical generator: wind, rather than a diesel engine or steam turbine, pro­ vides the energy. Blades capture energy in the wind and turn the turbines. Control Where exactly does wind energy come from? How can we generate electricity from the wind? What are some other uses for wind energy? If you are looking to find answers for questions like these, you are at the right place. What Is Wind Energy? By the term wind energy we mean air in motion (kinetic energy). Generating Electricity from Wind Energy With Wind Turbines. A wind turbine is in many ways the opposite of a fan. Instead of providing the electricity to get the fan to rotate, wind rotates the turbine to generate electricity. So, how exactly does wind energy produce electricity? The rotor blades on a wind turbine catches the kinetic energy in the wind and transfers it via a rotor shaft to the generator. The wing blades can be rotated and adjusted to the wind direction and strength, for maximum utilization of energy. When the rotor spins, the power is transferred via the drive shaft and gearbox. Generating Electricity from Wind Energy With Wind Turbines A wind turbine is in many ways the opposite of a fan. Instead of providing the electricity to get the fan to rotate, wind rotates the turbine to generate electricity.

For example: “I wake my son up at about 7am, then make sure he is awake and active for two hours before allowing him a nap in his room of no longer than 40 minutes. Unless you think that your baby is hungry or ill, see what happens if you leave your baby alone for a few minutes — he or she might settle down. If your baby wakes during the period that you want him or her to sleep, keep activity to a minimum. By three months, most babies can sleep for about six hours a night and are more alert during the day. If your baby isn't napping regularly, you should start working on a sleep schedule. Sleep experts and parents agree that the key to successful napping is to be consistent: Baby naps at the same time, in the same place, with the same routine each day. First, wait until your baby is physically and emotionally ready to sleep through the night, usually between 4 and 6 months of age.

At 9 to 12 months, most babies are down to two naps a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If your baby naps at a nursery or child minder's then speak to them, find out what time your baby’s naps take place there, and try to follow the same routine on the days when your baby is at home with you. the child is getting 11 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. the child takes longer to fall asleep for the morning nap. the child takes an increasingly shorter morning nap or too long of a morning nap and refuses an afternoon nap. In the end, you feel stuck in the “one nap is not enough and two is too many” phase When you are ready to begin the transition, push your child’s morning nap a little later. Babies like structure—it's the underlying principle for many popular parenting books, from Becoming Baby Wise to Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. And many moms agree. I can't change naptime, ever, says Allison, mom to baby Silas, from Virginia. I have to be consistent about what time my son naps..

Things to remember. 1  Slowly push the morning nap later in 20 to 30 minute increments, until you reach 12:30 pm or 1:00 pm.

Keeping pots moist, young poppies will quickly grow and once they are just a couple inches tall can be planted into their final positions whether it is a container or flower bed. Some people like to thin the plants from eight to ten inches apart when the seedlings reach a height of five to six inches. If you do thin out the plants, the remaining poppies will fill out more and produce more seed pods per plant. When the plants are ten inches tall start to fertilize with a liquid fertilizer. Poppy flower seeds will start to germinate after 14 to 28 days.

Ionic compounds are easily recognized because they contain a metal and a nonmetal. Covalent compounds are those which contain only nonmetals. The periodic table in the front cover of your text shows which elements fall into each class. The names for ionic compounds are very simple. The first part of the name is simply the name of the metal element. The second part of the name is the name of the nonmetal element, with the ending changed to the suffix –ide. For example, consider the compound Al 2 O 3. While the subscripts indicate that the compound consists of two atoms of aluminum and three atoms of oxygen, these numbers do not affect the name. The first part of the name would be aluminum. For the second part of the name, we drop the ending on oxygen and add –ide, thus it becomes oxide. The name of the compound is then aluminum oxide. When an ionic compound contains a transition metal, the names become a bit more complicated. The metals in the d and f blocks can have more than one charge and can thus form more than one compound. For example, iron and chlorine form two different compounds, FeCl 2 and FeCl 3. To distinguish them, What do ya do if the metallic element in a binary ionic compound has more than one ionic charge? if the metallic element in a binary ionic compound has more than one common ionic charge, a Roman numeral must be included in the cation name.

Background As long as people have looked at the Moon, they have wondered how far away it is from Earth. The average distance to the Moon is 382,500 km. The distance varies because the Moon travels around Earth in an elliptical orbit. At perigee, the point at which the Moon is closest to Earth, the distance is approximately 360,000 km.

The full moon rises behind some trees in this photo taken by skywatcher Brad Ervin in Bruswick, Georgia on March 19, 2011, when the moon was closer to Earth than it had been in 18 years. In the former, they found that the Moon was imperfectly blocked by the shadow of the Earth, and that the shadow was roughly 2.5 times the width of the Moon. In the latter, they noted that the Moon was of sufficient size and distance to block out the Sun. Also, since we know the time taken by the Earth to go once around the Sun (P = 1 year), and the distance traveled by the Earth in this process (approximately 2πa, since Earth's orbit is nearly circular), we can calculate the average orbital speed of Earth as v = (2πa)/P.

The elements of a star will help as we classify the solar systems and galaxies that we discover. Useful Websites. Star Colors and Temperatures. Why are the stars different colors? Color is a result of the way gemstones absorb light. Light is an electromagnetic vibration at certain wavelengths. The human eye can only perceive wavelengths between 380 and 750 nm. The colors of the spectrum that are visible to us are red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. If all the different wavelengths of light pass through a gemstone, it will appear colorless. On the other hand, if the gem material absorbs all light, it will be appear black. There is another important factor that can alter a stars color. If the star has any elements in its atmosphere it can change the light wavelength and that will cause a change in the color that we measure or observe. This may explain why there are so many different colors in the stars that are being studied. The coolest stars are the red stars and their temperature is around 3,000 degrees C. Articles >> Why are stars different colors? Throughout history mankind has gazed up at the stars in awe and wonder. To the naked eye, most of the stars appear white. As the light from the stars comes through the earth’s atmosphere, they appear to be twinkling. Until about two hundred years ago, everyone that studied the stars thought that all stars were white. This makes the cooler stars appear red and the stars with the higher temperatures appear blue or white. From cool to hot, the colors can appear red, orange, yellow, green and blue. If you remember the colors of the rainbow, you will see that these are in the same order. Red giants such as Betelgeuse are not actually that red in colour. If you look at the colour in table 4.3 above you can see that its actual colour would be more orange than true red. A small group of stars do, however, appear deep red. These are the carbon stars such as 19 or TX Piscium. A starfield in the region of Sagittarius showing stars of different colours. 1  Stellar Colours Human Vision. Interstellar Reddening and Extinction. 2  Measuring Colour - Colour Index Colour Index Problems. 3  Filters in Astronomy. However, idiochromatic gemstones are rare. Most gemstones are allochromatic, meaning that they are colored by impurities or trace elements in their crystal structure. For example, pure corundum is colorless. But corundum is typically red when traces of chromium are present and blue when there are traces of titanium. One thing you will notice from this list is that the relationship between chemical impurity and gemstone color is not a simple one. In some cases, a similar color can result from different trace elements; the green of an emerald can be the result of chromium or vanadium (or both). In other cases, a single trace element can produce different colors in different gem varieties. Thus chromium will produce a green color in emerald, but result in a red color in corundum. The colour of a star is primarily a function of its effective temperature. You should recall that a star approximates the behaviour of a black body radiator.

Another example is Sen et al. who found that gasoline prices were higher in states that instituted price ceilings. Another example is the Supreme Court of Pakistan decision regarding fixing a ceiling price for sugar at PKR45/kg. Price Ceilings. A price ceiling is the opposite of a price floor: It's a government-mandated maximum price for a good or service. As economists Paul Krugman and Robin Wells note in their basic text Microeconomics, price ceilings are far less common than price floors in the modern U.S. economy. Still, there are some. Rent-control law in New York and other major cities is an example of price ceilings. Price Floors When a price floor is set, a certain minimum amount must be paid for a good or service. If the price floor is below a market price, no direct effect occurs. If the market price is lower than the price floor, then a surplus will be generated. Minimum wage laws are good examples of price floors. In many states, the U.S. minimum wage law has no effect, as market wage rates for low-skilled workers are above the U.S. minimum wage rate. Difference Between Price Ceilings and Price Floor Both price ceilings and floors are forms of price controls. While a price ceiling dictates the maximum price of a good or service, a price floor refers to the lowest price for which a good or service may be sold. If the price ceiling is set below the market price, then a shortage is created; the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. The shortage may be resolved in many ways. One way is queuing; people have to wait in line for the product, and only those willing to wait in line for the product will actually get it. Key points. Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level. A price ceiling is a government-imposed price control, or limit, on how high a price is charged for a product. Governments use price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation, in the event of an investment bubble, or in the event of monopoly ownership of a product, all of which can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing, leading to shortages. Furth Price ceiling is a measure of price control imposed by the government on particular commodities in order to prevent consumers from being charged high prices. Price ceiling can also be understood as a legal maximum price set by the government on particular goods and services to make those commodities attainable to all consumers. Answers to Self-Check Questions. 1  A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the quantity supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage. 2  A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. A price floor is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product.[1] A price floor must be higher than the equilibrium price in order to be effective.

Just as gross motor skills begin to develop on the first day of life, so do fine motor skills. The following is a brief description of fine motor development from 0 months through 6 years. However, we must remember that newborns, infants, & What If My Child Does Not Yet Have A Dominant Hand? There are differing views on when hand dominance is established, but many experts agree that a consistent hand preference begins to emerge between ages 2 and 4 years, and that most children entering Kindergarten (age 5-6) have established a definite hand preference for using a pencil and scissors. In this photo, the child is reaching over to the left with his right hand. This is called crossing the midline. Before crossing the midline is established, you may have noticed that your young child tends to use the left hand on the left side of the body and the right hand on the right side of the body. Indicators for Hand Dominance. For the most part, babies start off using both hands to do things and preference for one hand or the other seldom manifests before seven to nine months of age. Even then, the preference may not necessarily be permanent. Usually around two years of age there is steady use of one hand in particular, but some four- to six-year-olds may still be ambivalent regarding a dominant hand. Tasks requiring each hand to perform different skilled movements develop during the preschool years and beyond. A majority of children show a preference by age 3 and most by school age, but Dr. Gesell wrote that hand dominance doesn't become well integrated in some normal children until eight or nine years of age (Gesell & Ames, 1947). Handedness is a better (faster or more precise) performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand. Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women. People use the hand that they prefer for fine motor skills, as well as other things. A person can be left handed and do most things with that hand, from writing to throwing a ball to brushing their teeth. Other people do only some things with their dominant hand, whether it is right or left. Terms I like to use are ‘doing hand’ (dominant) and ‘helping hand’ (supporting hand).

The recommendations hadn't been updated in the last decade, which had recommended diagnosis and treatment for kids ages 6 to 12, Reuters reported. Caring for a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can be challenging for the whole family. Parents may be hurt by their child's behavior as well as by the way other people respond to it. The stress of dealing with ADHD can lead to marital conflict. These problems may be compounded by the financial burden that ADHD can place on families. With hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, the child may: 1  often fidget or seem constantly on the go. 2  run around when it is not appropriate. 3  become easily frustrated when asked to take turns. 4  interrupt others. 5  make a lot of noise. The leading pediatricians' group also said that ADHD medications, including Ritalin and Vyvanse, can be used to treat 4- and 5-year-olds whose ADHD symptoms are moderate to severe, NPR reported. Those drugs aren't FDA-approved to treat people younger than age 6, but doctors are still allowed to prescribe drugs without an FDA recommendation. Once your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, treatment can begin. You, your child's doctor or psychologist, and the school will need to work together on a treatment plan. This plan may include medication, family counselling, and an education plan. For more information, please see the Treatment section of this site. Every child may sometimes have one or two of these symptoms. For a diagnosis of ADHD, the child's symptoms need to be excessive, long-term, and pervasive: Excessive: they occur more often than in other children of the same age and sex. Its criteria for ADHD are: 1  evidence of at least six of nine symptoms of inattention and/or at least six of nine symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity. 2  symptoms are inappropriate for the child's age and stage of development. 3  symptoms impair the child's functioning. In general, a child shouldn't receive a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder unless the core symptoms of ADHD start early in life — before age 12 — and create significant problems at home and at school on an ongoing basis. There's no specific test for ADHD, but making a diagnosis will likely include: Standard treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children include medications, education, training and counseling. These treatments can relieve many of the symptoms of ADHD, but they don't cure it. It may take some time to determine what works best for your child. Stimulant medications For a diagnosis of ADHD, the child's symptoms need to be excessive, long-term, and pervasive: 1  Excessive: they occur more often than in other children of the same age and sex. 2  Long-term: they have continued for months and are not just a response to a temporary situation.

PCP can be found in urine within 4 to 6 hours after use and will remain in urine for 7 to 14 days, depending on factors such as metabolic rate, user’s age, weight, activity, and diet.5 Phencyclidine is excreted in the urine as an unchanged drug (4% to 19%) and conjugated metabolites (25% to 30%).

Trade Winds Trade winds were introduced in Chapter 1 (Global weather patterns) as the equatorward blowing part of the Hadley cell. Because many cruising boats spend a lot of time in the trade wind region, some more detailed information is given in this chapter. Typical trade wind characteristics. The strength of the trade winds - like all the winds in the world - is predominantly determined by pressure gradient. Because the pressure of the equatorial trough, or ITCZ, is relatively stable at around 1008-1012 hPa, the strength of the trade winds is mostly determined by the strength and location of the subtropical high pressure. The low pressure is caused by the heatat the equator, which makes the air rise and travel north and southhigh in the atmosphere, until it subsides again in thehorse-latitude. Some of that air returns to the Doldrums throughthe trade-wind. Where do the trade winds occur? What are high altitude winds that occur in places where trade winds and polar easterlies meet prevailing weste? The trade wind normally strengthens just before an el nine occurs? More questions Trade Winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, warm air around the equator rises and flows north toward the pole. As the air moves away from the equator, the Coriolis effect deflects it toward the right. It cools and descends near 30 degrees North latitude. The descending air blows from the northeast to the southwest, back toward the equator (Ross, 1995). A similar wind pattern occurs in the Southern Hemisphere; these winds blow from the southeast toward the northwest and descend near 30 degrees South latitude. These prevailing winds, known as the trade winds, meet at the Intertropical Convergence Zone (also called the doldrums) between 5 degrees North and 5 degrees South latitude, where the winds are calm. The remaining air (air that does not descend at 30 degrees North or South latitude) continues toward the poles and is known as the westerly winds, or westerlies. The trade winds are so named because ships have historically taken advantage of them to aid their journies between Europe and the Americas (Bowditch, 1995). The westerlies (blue arrows) and trade winds (yellow and brown arrows) The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics, within the lower portion of the Earth's atmosphere, in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth's equator. The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase.

A carpet cleaner is designed to force a mixture of hot water and cleaning solution into the carpet to clean deep down. The solution and dirt are then extracted from the carpet, leaving the fibers and carpet base clean. Vacuums, even the best ones, simply can't reach the deep-down dirt at the base of your carpet's fibers. The carpet cleaning process is engineered to reach the dirt vacuums leave behind. Incidentally, although carpet cleaning does so much more than vacuuming, the actual work process itself is about as easy as vacuuming. How long will it take my carpet to dry after deep cleaning?

Children over age 6 can suck on hard candy (butterscotch seems to be a soothing flavor) or lollipops. Children over 8 years old can also gargle with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt per glass). Most sore throats are caused by viruses and are part of a cold. About 10% of sore throats are caused by strep bacteria. Tonsillitis (temporary swelling and redness of the tonsils) usually occurs with any throat infection, viral or bacterial. Swollen tonsils do not have any special meaning. In adults, Group B strep can cause urinary tract infections, blood infections, skin infections, pneumoniaand, rarely, meningitis, according to the CDC. Strep bacteria can also cause inflammation of the kidneys. Called post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, the condition can occur one to two weeks after a strep throat infection. One indication of this type of inflammation is rust-colored urine. Symptoms. Symptoms of strep throat typically appear several days after exposure to the bacteria. The most common symptom of a strep infection is a sore throat. Irritants such as smoke in the air can also make you feel raw. Strep throat is different -- it’s caused by bacteria. You need to know whether you or your child has strep or another illness so you can get the right treatment. How Do I Catch It? Strep throat is an infection of the throat and tonsils. Bacteria called group Astreptococcus cause it. They live in the nose and throat. You can get the infection from someone who is sick with strep A bacteria or is a carrier of it. Like other infections, it spreads through close contact. Strep throat can leave you feeling sore and scratchy. Learn what causes this infection and how to tell strep from other sore throat causes. Two types of bacteria can cause strep throat: Group A (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) and Group B. Each strain of bacteria can result in different complications. Strep bacteria are very contagious, and spread by nasal secretions and saliva. Strep throat most often afflicts children younger than 16, according to the Mayo Clinic. Strep throat itself is not particularly dangerous but the infection can worsen, especially if it goes untreated. If strep throat does not improve within two days of beginning treatment, it could indicate the presence of another infection, the spread of strep to other areas outside the throat, or an inflammatory reaction. Strep bacteria may infect the tonsils and sinuses if left untreated. The Strep test is not urgent, however, since treating a strep infection within 7 days of when it begins can prevent rheumatic fever. A Strep test is not necessary if your child's sore throat is part of a cold AND the main symptom is croup, hoarseness, or a cough, unless the sore throat lasts more than 5 days. If your child has strep throat, streptococci bacteria will grow in it. It usually takes about 2 days to get results from a throat culture. It can confirm whether your child has strep throat or not. Treatments. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. Most treatments last for about 10 days. Some people suffering from strep throat will also get swollen lymph glands in their neck. Others experience vomiting or a red skin rash. How Long Does Strep Throat Last? Strep throat will only last 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. Doctors usually treat strep throat with antibiotics even though they will not make you well any faster. Strep throat contagiousness will continue for 24 hours once antibiotics are started. With no treatment, strep throat continues to be contagious until symptoms resolve.

VSED must be distinguished from the naturally occurring loss of appetite and interest in food or water that occurs at the end of life. Last Updated: Thursday 14 July 2016 09:58. What is VSED (Voluntary Stopping Eating & Drinking)? This refers to the decision by a patient to stop eating food and drinking liquids when they have a terminal or life-limiting disease, so that their death can be hastened (and therefore their dying will not be prolonged). Withdrawal from friends and family: 1  People often focus inward during the last weeks of life. 2  They may lose interest in things they used to enjoy, such as favorite TV shows, friends, or pets. 3  Caregivers can let the patient know they are there for support. Why would someone stop eating and drinking? We know that up to 35% of patients in hospice programs have severe pain in the final week of life and 25% describe having shortness of breath that is “unbearable”. With such uncontrolled symptoms, they might say “I’m tired of this and I just want to go to sleep and not wakeup”.

            "input": "The fact that 97 percent of climate experts agree on this subject also demonstrates the strength of the scientific evidence on human-caused global warming. And the strength of the evidence is why the IPCC is able to say with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. These gases spread around the planet like a blanket, capturing the solar heat that would otherwise be radiated out into space. (For more detail on the basic mechanism of global warming, see carbon dioxide FAQ.) Both of these environmental problems do, however, have a common cause—human activities that release gases into and alter the atmosphere. Cooling from human aerosol emissions offsets about one-third of the warming from human greenhouse gas emissions. The new IPCC statement says that even taking that aerosol cooling effect into account, humans are still the main cause of the global warming over the past 60 years. Current Global Warming Caused by Greenhouse Gases, Not Nature. The IPCC elaborates further. What's causing global warming: human greenhouse gas emissions. With the evidence here and John's last post, you can bring it all together to make a pretty airtight logical proof for global warming. We know these things to be factually true: 1. Global temperatures have risen. 2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. 3. CO2's concentration in the atmosphere has risen significantly. 4. 100 percent of the global warming over the past 60 years is human-caused, according to the IPCC's latest report. The IPCC is 95 percent confident that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. Photograph: Jianan Yu/Reuters The fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. Many media outlets have reported that this is an increase from the 90 percent certainty in the fourth IPCC report, but actually the change is much more significant than that. That is a lot different from saying that CO2 is the main cause of global warming. Never mind the possibility that you allude to about nuclear testing. Never mind the possibility that air pollution causes more clouds, and clouds as any farmer knows keeps things generally warmer. How do we know CO2 is causing warming? Posted on 8 October 2009 by John Cook. We've just perused the empirical evidence that humans are raising atmospheric CO2 levels. In earlier posts, we noted that tallying up the planet's heat content shows that our climate is accumulating heat, proof of global warming. But is there any evidence that links the two? How do we know that humans are the major cause of global warming? Photo: freeimage4life/Flickr We all know that warming—and cooling—has happened in the past, and long before humans were around. Many factors (called “climate drivers”) can influence Earth’s climate—such as changes in the sun’s intensity and volcanic eruptions, as well as heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Some of it makes its way back to the surface of the earth. Hence we expect to find increasing downward longwave radiation as CO2 levels increase. Philipona 2004 finds that this is indeed the case - that downward longwave radiation is increasing due to an enhanced . Evans 2006 takes this analysis further. So how do scientists know that today’s warming is primarily caused by humans putting too much carbon in the atmosphere when we burn coal, oil, and gas or cut down forests? We know human activities are driving the increase in CO 2 concentrations because atmospheric CO 2 contains information about its source.

The initial period before the symptoms of a viral infection appear is called the incubation period. Whether the host is contagious depends on the virus. The average incubation period for the flu is 2 days, but it can last anywhere from 1 to 4 days in healthy adults. These are as follows: 1  Norovirus and Norwalk virus, which mostly affects adults and is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis or stomach flu. 2  Rotavirus which affects infants, toddlers and young children causes diarrhea and may result in dehydration. 3  Astrovirus also causes diarrhea in children. The norovirus. In the case of norovirus the incubation period, before the symptoms are manifested is usually one to three days. The patient can spread the infection to others right from the time he starts feeling sick till two or three weeks after he is cured of stomach flu. Normally the patient is not contagious during the incubation period of this virus. The rotavirus. On the other hand, those who contract the rotavirus, which usually causes diarrhea in children, will be contagious during the incubation period till about two weeks after recovery. The incubation period for the rotavirus could be for one or two days. Children are normally contagious for a longer period than adults. The adenovirus. The incubation period for the adenovirus is usually a week and the patient can spread the infection to others. In the case of stomach flu caused by the astrovirus the incubation period could be for a period of one to three or four days. Various symptoms There are various symptoms of the stomach virus. He had no symptoms of infection because he was still in the incubation period of the disease. In contrast to Ebolaviruses, poliovirus and norovirus are shed during the incubation period – in the feces, where they can infect others. Remarkably, viral incubation periods can vary from 1 or 2 days to years (Table; click to magnify). Short incubation times usually indicate that actions at the primary site of infection produce the characteristic symptoms of the disease.

Be sure to store them in their original container on a refrigerator shelf, rather than on the door, where the eggs will be more vulnerable to fluctuations in temperature because it's constantly opened and closed. Yogurt can be safely eaten up to 10 days after its sell-by date; beyond then the live bacterial cultures (which are healthful ingredients, and act as preservatives) will start to die. Mayonnaise is still good for a month after its expiration date (unopened) and up to four months after opening. Eggs, properly refrigerated, should last at least three to five weeks after the sell-by date. Canned goods are good to eat long after labeling dates, as long as the can is in good shape. If a can is dented, rusted, or swollen, toss it out. The short answer is that refrigerated yogurt is safe to eat up to 14 days after the expiration date, according to the FDA and the food processing giant General Mills.

If mold appears on yogurt, or if it develops an off odor, flavor or appearance, you should always discard it immediately.

Preheat the oven to 180C and put a baking sheet on the middle shelf. 2  2. Spread the crumbs over the base of a tall 20cm cake tin (springform if you have one) and press down firmly with a glass until you have a well compacted, flat base. Let the cheesecake sit in the turned-off oven with the door cracked for about an hour, then remove it from the water bath and let it cool completely on the stovetop. When you remove it from the waterbath, also run a thin-bladed knife around the edge to make sure the cake isn't sticking to the pan, which can also cause cracks as the cake settles. Principle #1. A cheesecake is a custard, not a cake. As a custard, the cheesecake should be thick, rich and creamy. As with any custard, a cheesecake relies on the proteins in the eggs to give it structure. The proteins coagulate as the temperature approaches 160 degrees. If it over bakes, the custard becomes dry. Principle #2 A long, slow bake allows for a more uniform internal temperature. Never bake over 350 degrees. We prefer a dark pan to uniformly absorb heat, not a reflective pan. Principle #3 Don’t over bake your cheesecake. Most cheesecakes are over baked and they tend to be dry, not creamy. An over baked cheesecake tends to crack. The cheesecake is baked when it is still jiggly but not soupy. The top of the cheesecake will jiggle as a whole and the center two inches will look softer. A cheesecake generally takes an hour to cook at around 350.

            "input": "As you look out into space, Earth's rotation gradually changes your viewpoint. You see one part of the sky and then rotate away from it to see another. Earth's motion (rotation)makes it seem as if the objects you see, the sun, stars, the moon - are moving past you. The objects have apparent motion. It takes Earth 24 hours to complete one Day (slightly more than one 360 degree rotation). It takes 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 9 seconds for Earth to make one revolution around the sun. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/Mitc... More specifically, our rotation period (the time elapsed for one rotation) with respect to the stars is called a sidereal day. A sidereal day is 24 sidereal hours, or 23 hours and 56 minutes on a normal clock. Our clock time is based on the earth's rotation with respect to the sun from solar noon to solar noon. This is a solar day, and it is divided into 24 hours. Because Earth travels about 1 / 365 of the way around the sun during one day, there is a small difference between solar time and sidereal time. position with respect to the sun after it reaches the same position with respect to the stars. At what speed does the Earth move around the Sun?

Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre, which lies about 4,600 km from Earth's center. On average, the distance to the Moon is about 385,000 km from Earth's center, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of 1.022 km/s, the Moon covers a distance approximately its diameter, or Considering the Earth–Moon system as a binary planet, its centre of gravity is within Earth, about 4,624 km (2,873 mi) or 72.6% of the Earth's radius from the centre of the Earth. This centre of gravity remains on the line between the centres of the Earth and Moon as the Earth completes its diurnal rotation. The path of the Earth–Moon system in its solar orbit is defined as the movement of this mutual centre of gravity around the sun. So, in order to know the speed, we just have to figure out the distance traveled by the Earth when it goes once around the Sun. To do that we will assume that the orbit of the Earth is circular (which is not exactly right, it is more like an ellipse, but for our purpose a circle is close enough). So the distance traveled in one year is just the circumference of the circle. The atmosphere around the Earth rotates with the Earth. Everything on the ground, in the water, or in the air also rotates - with the Earth - at the same speed as the Earth. What can impact the travel time for east-west vs. west-east are the prevalent winds caused by coriolis effect which in turn arises because of the Earth’s rotation. A: A complete rotation of the earth on its axis takes approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes and four seconds with respect to the background stars. However, the sun returns to the same place in the sky (correcting for seasonal differences) every 24 hours. The Earth's Moon is the fifth largest in the whole solar system, and is bigger than the planet Pluto. The Moon has a nearly circular orbit (e=0.05) which is tilted about 5° to the plane of the Earth's orbit. Its average distance from the Earth is 384,400 km. The combination of the Moon's size and its distance from the Earth causes the Moon to appear the same size in the sky as the Sun, which is one reason we can have total solar eclipses.

            "input": "Once nicotine consumption is stopped, then both nicotine levels and nicotine metabolite levels in the blood decrease, but it must be kept in mind that these levels do not disappear altogether. The simplest answer to the question of how long does it take for nicotine to leave your system is a few weeks. Once nicotine consumption is stopped, nicotine levels in the blood begin to gradually decrease. Nicotine has a half-life in the human body of 2 hours (although it can range from 1 to 4 hours in different individuals). The average smoker has a blood nicotine concentration of about 40 ng/ml after an evening cigarette. And usually when signing up for life insurance they will ASK you if you've smoked in the last 12 months, but the testing is not that thorough, its the same nicotine test no matter what, they dont take your hair or anything, its a simple blood test. Ive heard it takes 30 days but not 100% sure. Nicotine has been shown to be an even more addictive drug than others such as heroine! The lingering presence of nicotine in the body acts as a reminder for nicotine consumption. It is popularly believed that nicotine is released from the human body within 72 hours of its consumption, but the truth is far different. The various aspects of nicotine storage in the body last for weeks after the most recent consumption of nicotine. Many people wonder about how long nicotine stays in your blood. Blood harbors both nicotine and metabolites released by nicotine. I recently got hired for a job and had to undergo cotinine testing, however because I drank a lot of water, the lab requested a second test due to dilution. Before my first testing, I had been smoke free for 3 days. I took the test, then ignorantly lit a cigarette, it tasted awful.. I probably took 2 or 3 puffs off of it before throwing it out. Sorry to split hairs on this, but given that the typical half-life of nicotine is 2 hours, and that most assays have a limit of detection of 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml, following the logic I described above, all the nicotine has gone from the blood stream within 24 hours. i.e. when you take a blood sample from a smoker 24 hours after their last smoke, they will most likely have a blood nicotine level <0.5 ng/ml. (i.e.>95% gone by 24 hrs). She's more concerned with how long it takes nicotine and what I would call, by products, from leaving her body, than she is as to why the doctor has asked her to quit smoking. She even said the doctor told her he wanted the nicotine out for 30 days so the surgery would be successful. How long can nicotine be detected in blood or urine after quiting smoking? [Top] The byproducts of nicotine can be detected in the blood for up to a month after you stop smoking. This is only of concern if you are in a situation where someone else might want to test you for the presence of nicotine or nicotine byproducts in your system. However, the metabolite of nicotine which is known as Cotinine leaves its traces in blood as well as in urine for up to 7 days. About 85 to 90 per cent of the nicotine which is present in your blood is metabolised by the liver and is thrown out of your system by the kidney. But due to the higher concentration, many a times, it still persists in the blood stream. Nicotine is a very highly addictive chemical that is the main component of cigarettes. Your body, especially your heart and lungs, will usually begin to heal at 12 hours after you’ve had your last cigarette/ stopped smoking. Finally, as nicotine levels in the blood keep decreasing over the coming weeks, the nicotine stored by various tissues in the body recedes to significantly lower levels. Patients with surgical procedures planned are often advised to quit smoking weeks before surgery so that healing can be improved. Query: how long before nicotine out of your blood",

The exact answer to that question depends to a large extent on storage conditions - keep turkey deli meat (also known as lunch meat, luncheon meat or cold cuts) refrigerated at all times. Large chunks of deli meat, as well as slices of deli meat, can be kept in the freezer for 1 to 2 months if properly packaged. After this time, the quality of the meat begins to deteriorate, affecting texture and flavor. Dry cured meats, because they contain less moisture, can be frozen for longer, up to 3 months.

You can still enjoy a half-finished bottle of wine -- but don't wait too long.

Wine Life Expectancy. Exactly how long your wine will last depends on the wine itself. Most red and white wines will last for about two to three days after opening; after this point, they begin to sour and lose their flavor. Sparkling wines lose their carbonation almost immediately and should be enjoyed as soon as they are opened. How long does a box of red plonk tend to last, once opened, given that each contains about four litres when full? THE ANSWER As you tap the spout to pour, the bladder collapses, just like those burp-free Playtex Nurser baby bottles. This minimizes the wine's exposure to air, and thus to the corrosive effects of oxidation, as it's dispensed. A boxed wine can survive nicely for several weeks after opening. The bag offers a less-than-perfect hermetic seal, however. Small amounts of air get in over time, even if the box remains unopened. Typically, it's meant to be consumed within nine months to a year, and many boxes come stamped with best-before dates. Now here you are the next day/three days/week with half a bottle of wine and the timeless question: How long does an open bottle of wine last, really? Because wine can be made in so many different ways, it’s impossible to give you a hard out on all wines.

One is built to sit on gas station shelves for years, and the other just got picked and has about three days before it dies. It's similar with wine. The best way to keep wine after you’ve opened it, is to remember to recork it and put it in the fridge. By recorking and refrigerating, you’re limiting the wine’s exposure to oxygen, heat, and light. These are all the things that take a bottle of wine from being next-day-decent to downright disgusting. If you were responsible enough to remember these precautions before you hit the hay, a bottle of red or white wine can last approximately between two and five days. By contrast, fortified wines such as port or sherry can last several weeks or more; the higher the alcohol content, the longer the life of the wine. Wine lifespan varies depending on the acidity of the wine; a high-acidity wine such as a Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc will survive a little longer than a lower-acidity wine such as a Pinot Grigio.

I was supposed to take my braces off last christmas but I still have them on because my teeth arent cooperating. Braces can stay on for a year or 2 . maybe even more. It all depends on how much work the dentist has to do. There's more than one path to straight teeth. The type of treatment you choose depends on how your teeth need to move to streamline your smile. Regular braces: These use gentle pressure to move your teeth into place over time. Your orthodontist will glue brackets to the front of your teeth and connect them with a wire. He'll tighten that wire every 4 to 6 weeks. This slowly moves your teeth or jaw or both into place. It depends on your treatment, but the average adult has braces for 18 months to 3 years. It usually costs between $5,000 and $6,000. Other braces: If having a metal smile bothers you, ceramic braces are another option. The brackets are the color of your teeth, which makes them harder to see. How long should all the teeth look PERFECT before they can take the braces off. In other words.. how long do your teeth have to be in a perfect position, with NOTHING left to work on in your mouth (at least to your visible eye) before the braces come off? I was always under the assumption there was a retention phase while in braces, but is it possible to just take them off right after things are done, and retain immediately with only retainers?? You should then keep wearing your removable retainers 1-2 nights a week for as long as possible; in other words for as long as you want your teeth to remain straight! This is called ‘long-term retention’.

Modern orthodontics are a great option for any age, and braces remain a popular and effective method for straightening teeth and correcting bite. “Will I have to do to PROM with braces on? Will I have to get my DRIVER’S LICENSE with braces on? Will I have to get MARRIED with braces on? Will I DIE with braces on? Good grief! Why can’t they just tell me that my braces can come off TODAY?!” Here’s the answer: There isn’t a certain time that braces must be on teeth to finish the job. Every single patient is unique in what he or she needs. Every patient’s treatment plan is different in order get the result that he or she wants – that perfect smile to go with every situation imaginable. Before. 1  If traded with conventional braces, this young man's case would most likely have required the extraction of four teeth to make room for his severe crowding, and he would have been in treatment for two years or more. This would have resulted in a narrower smile, and a negative effect on his profile in later years. When most people think of orthodontic braces, they think of teenagers. But an increasing amount of adults are getting braces, too. As long as your teeth and gums are healthy, you could benefit from getting your teeth straightened. One of the most important things to consider is the state of your gums and jaw bones. If you have unhealthy gums, a lot of gum recession, or bone loss, braces may not be recommended because the pressure they put on your gums could cause unfavorable complications. If indeed your back teeth are already in good position and you're only straightening front teeth it should take less than a year. Braces are often worn up to 3 months AFTER the teeth are straight in order to stabilize the new position of the teeth and provide better long-term stability. Hope this helps...GOOD LUCK! How long will it take to fix an overbite with braces? Dr. S. Jay Bowman Dr. Bowman Overbite: In layman's terms, an overbite typically refers to the upper front teeth sticking out horizontally, further than the lower front teeth. An orthodontist defines an overbite as the vertical overlap of the upper front teeth over the lower front teeth. They are very different situations unfortunately with the same name.

Re how do hydra digest food madsci network. Many animals rely on organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines to aid in digestion, the jellyfish has none of these. A single cavity, the coelenteron, serves as a jellyfish’s stomach and intestine. Food that makes it into the jellyfish’s stomach is broken down by digestive enzymes produced by cells lining the inner body cavity. Quick Answer. Cnidarians obtain food, mostly prey animals such as crustaceans and fish, by passively waiting for animals to pass by and touch their tentacles, whereupon they poison them and draw them toward their mouths to be digested. Cnidaria (/naɪˈdɛəriə/[4]) is a phylum containing over 10,000[5] species of animals found exclusively in aquatic (freshwater and marine) environments: they are predominantly marine species. Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Digestion, respiration, and excretion. Food is taken in and wastes are discharged through the mouth. Extracellular digestion occurs in the coelenteron, which has, in all except hydrozoans The Cnidaria's digestive system is very complex but also simple. They have a one way digestive system. On way meaning that all of food ( digested or not ) go through the same way. This process is called the Gastrovascular Cavity. Every animal has their way of surviving this forever changing world.

Every “groin pull” is a muscle strain of one or more of your hip adductors, for instance. You can strain virtually any muscle in your body, but the commonly strained muscles are: the hamstrings Searching for muscle strain is a bit tricky, because “muscle strain” is mentioned in lots of papers that aren’t really about muscle strain. But if you cleverly search for the terms “muscle strain” only in titles, you will get, as of 4/14/07, only 61 search results, even less than iliotibial band syndrome (another under-studied condition). Muscle Strain Overview Muscle strain, muscle pull, or even a muscle tear refers to damage to a muscle or its attaching tendons. You can put undue pressure on muscles during the course of normal daily activities, with sudden heavy lifting, during sports, or while performing work tasks. Some of the things that get confused with muscle strains are (and these will all be covered in more detail below): 1  Muscle cramps and spasms (charlie horses) are whole muscle contractions, ranging from uncomfortable to those howling, awful attacks that usually afflict the calves and feet. Typical symptoms of a lower back pulled muscle include some combination of the following: 1  The pain is usually localized in the lower back, meaning that it doesn’t radiate into the leg (as in sciatica) 2  The lower back may be sore upon touch. 3  Pain usually comes on suddenly. Though not serious, back muscle spasms can cause significant pain. Inflammation also causes pain. Healing time depends on the severity of the strain. Mild muscle strains usually heal within two weeks. Moderate muscle strains may take six to eight weeks to heal. Prevention of Recurring Back Strain Moderate muscle strains may take six to eight weeks to heal. Prevention of Recurring Back Strain. Many people who experience recurring back pain have weak core muscles - the muscles that support the back. Strengthening these muscles can prevent back strain from recurring, though the time for strength exercises is after the back pain has resolved. Like back strain, back sprains may trigger back muscle spasms. Healing time depends on the severity of the sprain. Most back sprains heal in six to eight weeks but it can take several months for complete recovery from a severe back sprain. To help prevent muscle strains: 1  Warm up before participating in sports and activities. 2  Follow an exercise program aimed at stretching and strengthening your muscles. 3  Increase the intensity of your training program gradually. Never push yourself too hard, too soon. 4  Maintain a healthy body weight. Here’re are some easy steps to get you back in the gym or back on the mat, without pain: 1  Rest. 2  Go see a good chiropractor, acupuncturist, or massage therapist. 3  Cupping. 4  Foam Roller. 5  Anti-Inflammatory Diet. 6  Ice.

Adequate dietary intake of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, essential minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids may help protect against the cognitive decline associated with normal aging . Effects of Nutrition and Exercise on Cognitive Performance Diet, nutrition and exercise are as important in chess as they are in any other sport. The following is a brief guide containing basic advice on nutrition and exercise for optimum physical and cognitive performance. Because age-related cognitive decline has been linked to free radical-induced oxidative damage in the brain , antioxidant supplements might help protect against cognitive aging. Prospective cohort studies have reported that vitamin C intake from supplements or vitamin E intake from food and supplements was associated with some protection against cognitive decline. Cognitive function did not decline in either group over the two-year period , suggesting that longer intervention trials are needed to determine whether long-chain omega-3 fatty acids have utility in the prevention of age-related cognitive decline. Cerebral blood supply. At rest, the brain receives approximately 15% of cardiac output (9). Proper cerebral blood supply is necessary to deliver oxygen, glucose and other macronutrients, and the required micronutrients for proper cognitive function. Nutrition has a role in maintaining optimal blood supply to the brain. DIET AND NUTRITION A balanced diet is as essential for cognition as for any other bodily process – you require protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and fats for your brain and your body to function properly. A diet high in saturated fats and refined sugars such as sucrose and fructose can contribute to cognitive impairment and decline. To take an advanced case, memory impairment has long been observed in adults with type-2 diabetes and numerous studies have demonstrated that both poor glycemic control and acute ingestion of high glycemic index carbohydrate foods leads to lower performance and memory impairment. For more information on micronutrients and phytochemicals related to cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases, see the article on Micronutrients for Older Adults. Cognitive decline has been linked to decreased levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the brain . Thus, effects of dietary calcium inadequacy would primarily result in negative effects to bone health. Interestingly, changes in calcium homeostasis in the brain may contribute to the cognitive decline associated with normal aging and possibly to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (61, 62). Summary. 1  The brain requires a constant supply of micronutrients for energy metabolism of neurons and glial cells, neurotransmitter synthesis and action, nerve impulse propagation, and homocysteine metabolism. 2  Deficiencies in various micronutrients, especially the B vitamins, have adverse effects on cognition. As always, consuming a healthy, balanced diet and exercising moderately and regularly is the best advice for maintaining optimum cognitive and physical health.

A Month Before a Heart Attack, Your Body Will Warn You With These 8 Signals! - Duration: 6:24. 7ReMix Healthy Tips TV 189,400 views A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. Although a heart attack is a frightening event, if you learn the signs of a heart attack and what steps to take, you can save a life—perhaps even your own. Many people think that heart attacks are a “man’s problem,” yet heart disease is actually the number one killer of both men and women in the United States. To diagnose a heart attack, an emergency care team will ask you about your symptoms and begin to evaluate you. The diagnosis of the heart attack is based on your symptoms and test results. The goal of treatment is to treat you quickly and limit heart muscle damage. Tests to Diagnose a Heart Attack. ECG . Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men. What is cardiac arrest? About every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Your heart muscle needs oxygen to survive. A heart attack occurs when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely (View an animation of blood flow). Several studies have demonstrated that there is seasonal variation in heart attacks. They are most likely to occur in the winter, and least likely to occur in the summer. This is not just true for heart attacks, but also other cardiovascular events. Several explanations have been proposed. Heart attacks may seem like a senior citizen phenomenon, considering that about 82% of people who die of coronary heart disease are at least 65, according to the American Heart Association. But sudden heart problems can occur much earlier in life, too. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack. 1. A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, occurs when a part of the heart muscle doesn’t receive enough blood flow.

Nothing is known which could have stopped the parent giving an extra chromosome. While similar to simple trisomy 21, the difference is that the extra chromosome 21 is present in some, but not all cells, of the individual. This type of Down syndrome is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization. The name comes from a random order of normal and abnormal cells (a mosaic). Although translocation Down syndrome occurs via a different mechanism than trisomy 21, the physical and features that mark the condition are the same. Mosaic Down Syndrome In mosaic Down syndrome, not all cells in the body have 46 chromosomes. Translocation Down syndrome: This type accounts for a small percentage of people with Down syndrome (about 3%). 2 This occurs when an extra part or a whole extra chromosome 21 is present, but it is attached or “trans-located” to a different chromosome rather than being a separate chromosome 21.

Translocation, the third form, occurs in only three to four percent of people with Down syndrome. In translocation, a piece of chromosome or a whole chromosome breaks off during meiosis and attaches itself to another chromosome.

I took one dose prior to a dental appt and had it show on a pre-employment screen about 4-6 weeks later and that is supposed to be the detection time for chronic use but I took only one dose (1mg) prior to a dental appt because that is the ONLY time I use Xanax so I know exactly when I took it and how long it had been. I have panic attacks, and never take these besides this one time. Answer. Xanax, or alprazolam, is an anti-anxiety medication that is in a class of compounds called benzodiazepines. As you know, it can be an effective treatment for a number of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorders. However, it also has a high potential for abuse and/or dependence. In older or obese people, or those with liver disease, Xanax’s half-life is longer, as long as 40 hours. It takes several half-lives to eliminate a drug completely. So for most people, there may still be a small fraction of Xanax in your blood two days or more after taking a single pill. In order to address your particular concerns and questions regarding this medication, I recommend that you schedule an appointment to speak with your doctor, so that he or she can address your individual case. Having said that, the average half-life of xanax is approximately 11 hours. This means that half of the medication will have left the body by that time. On the other hand, it is important to note that everyone metabolizes medications differently, so this half-life can range from 6 to 26 hours, depending on the person and the dose and frequency of the use of the medication. However, Xanax remains in the bloodstream long after its anti-anxiety effects have worn off. Xanax’s average half-life is 11 hours. This means that it takes an average of 11 hours for the body to eliminate half the Xanax dose. I know everyone is different but this is my story. I don't take Xanax but I took 1 mg a day for 7 days straight and than stopped completely, my system was totally clean before I started taking them. My job does test so I had purchased some drug screen urine test cards for benzos just to see how long it would take before it got out of my system. I figured probably 72 hours, well it actually took 8 days for my tests to start reading a negative result. Here's what my pdoc told me to help the xanax get in your system quicker. Take a drink of water and make sure your mouth is wet. Chew up the xanax and then stick it between your upper lip and teeth. Leave there. It will kick in about 10 to 15 mins if not sooner. I do this when having a really bad attack. Xanax is a little bitter but you can actually get used to it. When it's been long enough take another drink of water and swallow it all. This helps it to get into your blood stream much quicker rather than going through your stomach lining. I hope this helps. As for how many to take a day I would talk to your dr about that. deleted_user 12/03/2007 I used to take Klonopin, then Ativan and my recent doctor finally put me on Xanax, which is truly a lifesaver.

Weight is crucial; lugers weighing less than the basic weights — 165 pounds for women, 198 pounds for men — can make up the weight, with some restrictions. The extra weights are attached to the luger, not the luge. Garments must meet a number of requirements and are limited to 8.8 pounds of maximum weight. Luge runners may not be heated and are checked before each run. Winners are determined by the aggregate times of four runs for singles and two runs for doubles. Walter Plaikner, the chairman of the federation’s technical commission and coach of the Italian luge team, told reporters a year ago that 150 k.p.h. was “about as fast as we can go in our sport.” In the first Olympic training run Friday at the Whistler Sliding Centre, seven luge riders surpassed 150 k.p.h. But Olympic and luge officials chose not to make changes to the course that would limit the record speeds — in excess of 90 miles per hour, or 145 kilometers per hour — that the sliding-sport athletes were attaining. Answers.com ® WikiAnswers ® Categories Sports Olympics Winter Olympic Games Olympics Luge How fast does luge go? Venue: Luge events will take place at a track called Spiral, the first artificial ice track in Asia, which is located in the foothills of Mount Iizuna in the Asakawa district in the northern part of Nagano City. The 1,700-meter track has an elevation of 113 meters and encompasses 15 curves. History: Although the sport of luge is sometimes thought of as being relatively new, sled racing is actually one of the oldest of all winter sports. The word luge comes from the French word for sled. In Germany it is known as rodel, and it is in the alpine countries of Europe that the sport began. At the turn of the century, luge was actually governed by the International Bobsled Federation which administered all the ice-track racking sports. In 1953, the sport gained its own International Governing Body with the formation of the Federation Internationale de Luge de course (FIL), and in 1964 it was inaugurated as an Olympic sport at the Winter Games in Innsbruck. Having no formal luge program at the time, the first U.S. team was made up of American soldiers who were stationed in Europe. Back in the United States, luge attracted a small number of athletes who were relegated to training on the 1932 Olympic bobsled run in Lake Placid, N.Y. How do fast cars go fast? A long-stretched transmission, and an engine that can power it til the end, along with aerodynamics to enable it to run at high speeds. Edit It is a familiar emotion for athletes in the sliding sports. Whistler immediately became the fastest track in the world, eliciting speeds of nearly 96 m.p.h. (about 154 kilometers per hour) in luge, a sport in which riders lie on a sled and wear little protection but a skintight suit and a helmet. Manuel Pfister of Austria reached 95.6 m.p.h. (154 k.p.h.), the fastest luge speed recorded during a training run on Thursday. “We are going to have to put in speed limits for the next track,” the luge federation’s spokesman, Wolfgang Harder, told Reuters on Thursday, referring to the next Olympics.

Also, knee replacements last for many years, but you may need revision surgery. About 90 percent of knee replacement patients have a successful outcome following surgery. If you answered yes to most or all of the questions, you may be a candidate for knee replacement surgery. How Are Patients Evaluated for Knee Replacement? Most total knee replacement patients are 60 to 80 years old, but some patients are younger or older and do very well following surgery. FRIDAY, March 22 (HealthDay News) -- Getting back to work after knee-replacement surgery is a big concern for people contemplating the procedure. Now, a new study shows that most people return to work after a total knee replacement-- even those with physically demanding jobs. The research, scheduled for presentation Thursday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in Chicago, shows that 98 percent of people who undergo total knee replacements are able to go back to work afterward. Hi Sue- I've just read your post from 5 months ago and wondering how you got on , when did you return to work and how you've coped once there? I am having a knee replacement in 3 weeks time and I am a full time teaching assistant in a reception class- 4-5 year olds! I want to help out school as much as possible by giving a realistic prediction so they can arrange a temporary replacement for me. The time a knee replacement patient can return to work varies not only by the individual, but also by the type of profession. Patients employed in sedentary jobs may be able to return to work when they can safely travel to and from their job, generally between 2 to 6 weeks. After your hip replacement surgery, you will most likely be in the hospital for three to five days. In some cases, patients will stay for additional days of rehabilitation, but typically discharge takes place within one week. The following is a chart of the estimated cost of knee replacement around the world: Country Estimated Price (USD) United States $45,000-$60,000 Singapore $18,000-$22,000 Thailand $12,000-$14,000 Taiwan $9,000-$10,000 India $7,000-$11,000 If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident, you can have it done for nothing under the nationally ... Knee replacement surgery is one of the most common bone surgeries in the U.S. If you have severe arthritis, an injury, or a condition that affects your knees, learn more about the type of surgery that might be right for you. Various sources have published statistics on the long-term revision rates for knee replacement. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and by observing TKR patients over an eight-year period ending in 2003, the long-term revision rate is 2 percent for five or more years. Return to work should be phased, however, with three half-days in the first week, two full days in the second week, five half-days in the third week, and full-time by week four. Recovery from knee replacement surgery takes a minimum of three months, but most likely six. A full recovery can take around eight to ten months. The degree of improvement during rehabilitation often depends on the strength of your body before surgery, your body weight, and your ability to manage pain.

The Reproductive Cycle in Dogs. In order to answer the question, how long are dogs pregnant, you first need to understand the dog reproductive cycle.

A female cat that is sexually mature (after the age of 6 to 12 months) and has heat cycles can get pregnant is she meets a male cat. The gestation period is 9 weeks or 63 days. However, this is only an average; the cat may give birth earlier (as early as 58 days after the fertilization) or later (67 days after the fertilization). Ordinary domestic short-hair and long-haired cats are very fertile. Litter size averages four or five kittens. For some reason, Siamese cats also have larger litters. Persians and other fancy breeds tend to be less fertile. One thing you can be relieved about is that you won’t have to deal with the annoyances of a female cat in heat during that time. A cat will not go into heat again until after the babies are born. Caring for Your Cat During Gestation. It’s important to make your pregnant cat as comfortable as possible during gestation.

            "input": "While out on a long term injury under work comp, I was notified that FMLA was being imposed on me. I thought that FMLA was an employee benefit, now it may be used as an employer weapon. A 4 to 6 week injury under work comp can easily turn into a 12 week, loss of job. As you can see, a decision to terminate any employee while on a medical leave of absence is a complex one that can involve the interplay of multiple laws and consideration of a myriad of different facts and circumstances. Yes, companies can fire an employee who’s on intermittent FMLA leave. Despite the fears of many employers, FMLA doesn’t confer some kind of special dispensation for workers who exercise their leave rights. Obviously, workers can’t be fired for taking leave. But employers can lay off, discipline and terminate those employees who violate company policies or perform poorly. When an employee on FMLA leave is terminated, the DOL decrees that the burden’s on the employer to prove the worker would have been disciplined or terminated regardless of the leave request or usage. Reductions in force When the clerk was fired two weeks before she was to return to work, she sued her employer for violating her rights under FMLA. The employer argued that the clerk was fired for failing to perform her duties, and that she wasn’t entitled to special protection under FMLA law. A court found in favor of the clerk. She had many years of service, her employer failed to formally discipline her for earlier lapses and her job description had no emphasis on training. To avoid a claim that the employer discriminated against the employee, or that the employer interfered with the individual’s rights under the FMLA, the employer must be able to show that the employee would have been terminated even if that individual had not taken medical leave. If, after seven (7) calendar days the identified deficiencies have not been resolved, the request for leave will be denied. C. Pay Status While on Non-FMLA Medical Leave. An employee who is taking Non-FMLA Medical Leave must use all accrued time off banks prior to being placed in an unpaid leave status. Examples of such reasons from relevant caselaw include the following: 1  If an employee would have been terminated regardless of FMLA leave because of poor performance, then the employee may be terminated before, during or after FMLA leave. See Richmond v. Oneok (1997); and. If, prior to the leave, an employee fails to meet the goals of a corrective action program designed to improve performance, then the employee may be terminated upon return from FMLA leave. See Hubbard v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Assoc. (1998). How you handle such requests for extra time can make the difference between an appreciative employee and a messy lawsuit. Quick-trigger firings after FMLA leave have led to an increasing amount of ADA claims. Advice: Have a clear HR process for handling requests for leave after FMLA runs out. To decide if you must grant additional leave as an ADA accommodation, first determine whether the person’s condition qualifies as a disability under the ADA. Then see if the employee’s certification includes a return date. First, the 12 months of service do not have to be continuous or consecutive; all of the time you’ve worked for the employer is counted. You can leave and then return, but you still must have worked 1,250 hours in the past 12 months to qualify (unless you are a military reservist returning from active duty). The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 allows employees to take reasonable unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. It can provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year, and also requires that the employee's group health benefits be maintained during the leave.

You can also increase omega-3 intake by eating fatty cold-water fish, walnuts and flaxseeds. Conclusion. Any vitamin supplement that you and your doctor agree should be added to your diet can be taken with levothyroxine, provided that you don't take your vitamin or supplement within four hours of taking your thyroid replacement hormone. Before taking this medicine. Levothyroxine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems. Since thyroid hormone occurs naturally in the body, almost anyone can take levothyroxine. However, you may not be able to take this medicine if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have: Make sure to separate levothyroxine and antacids or gas-relieving medications by at least four hours. Antidepressant Medications Combining levothyroxine with some antidepressants may change the amount of levothyroxine your body needs, and your healthcare provider may need to adjust your levothyroxine dosage. It is also best to take both of these medications on an empty stomach. Take omeprazole at least 30 minutes before a meal. And even though you can take penicillin VK with food, it works better if you take it with an empty stomach. ...Read more Synthroid morning routine. 1  Synthroid’s part of my morning routine. 2  Every day starts with me immediately going into the kitchen to take my medication and drink water. 3  My morning routine starts with Synthroid. 4  I get up and I reach for the Synthroid and my water. 5  It’s 7:30 am and I’m getting up, and on the shelf are my medications. No soy no iron: Although the packaging for levothyroxine says to take it on an empty stomach for many people its not possible to do that and take it consistently each day. As long as you take it at a consistent time and don't take it with soy or with iron which will interfere with its absorption it is fine to take it with breakfast or before bed without being strictly fasting. Antacids often used to treat heartburn and other intestinal distress, including calcium products such as TUMS or ROLAIDS and other antacids, may have absorption-inhibiting effects on thyroid medications. People should take levothyroxine four to six hours before or after taking these antacids. Iron supplements (FEOSOL, SLOW FE) have been shown to reduce the effect of levothyroxine in some people, although the effect is highly variable from one person to another.

Getting the Retro Receiver up and running is as easy as plugging a controller into the front of your Super Nintendo—but it might actually be easier since there’s no cord to first untangle. The adapter draws all the power it needs from the SNES’ controller ports, so you don’t even have to worry about recharging it. You get the system with 30 games, one NES Classic Controller, one HDMI cable, an AC Adapter and a cool poster featuring the NES, ROB the robot and two game cartridges, Duck Hunt and Gyromite. Sadly, neither game made the list of 30. 100 bucks it will be short just because the controller is just a redesigned VC classic controller made to connect to the wii remote. If you love math… figure out how many NES Classic Edition systems can fit inside of an original NES console. Sounds like a worthy SAT question. The controller cord is a bit short. In addition to the NES Classic, the Bluetooth controller is compatible with PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, if you need a retro-style controller for any of those platforms (that’s where the extra buttons come in handy). I have an original NES controller, which seems a lot less stiff. I needed a second controller for all the amazing co-op games Nintendo has. The buttons on this third party controller are responsive.

It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only object in space other than Earth where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found. Titan is the sixth gravitationally rounded moon from Saturn. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's Moon, and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the smallest plane Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's Moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth. Titan is primarily composed of water ice and rocky material. Saturn's orbit around the sun is right around a billion miles out. Earth's orbit is just inside 100 million. So, Saturn can be as close to us as just under a billion miles, or … as far away as nearly 2 billion, depending on what side of the sun we're on. Saturn orbits the sun once every 30 years. How far is the planet Saturn from planet Earth? The planet Saturn was relatively close to Earth on December 31, 2003, when it was about 746 million miles away. It is some 900 million miles away from the sun. Titan is the largest moon of Saturn. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only object in space other than Earth where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found. Titan is the sixth ellipsoidal moon from Saturn. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's Moon, and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the smallest planet, Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Viewed from Earth, Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 mi)) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 arcseconds in diameter. The small, irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion is locked in a 3:4 orbital resonance with Titan. How far is Saturn from Earth at aphelion? At Saturn's aphelion, it is about 10.1 AU from the Sun. Therefore, it would be anywhere between 9.1 and 11.1 AU from the Earth, depending on whether Earth is on the same side … of the Sun as Saturn, or on the opposite side. How far is Saturn from the Earth? The distance is always changing as both planets move around the Sun. The average is about 1.4 billion kilometers, or more than 8 times as far as Earth is from the Sun (8 AU). … At its closest, when both planets are on the same side of the Sun, Saturn is about 8 AU (1.2 billion km or 744 million miles) from us. This depends where the two planets are in their orbits! At their closest Saturn is around 1.2 billion km away from Earth (roughly 7 AU) and when they are at their most distant from each other, Saturn is approximately 1.67 billion km from Earth (around 11 AU). Saturn's distance is 1,010,000,000 miles (1,620,000,000 kilometers) from Earth. It took images of Titan, including Titan and Saturn together in mid to late 1979.

Do not cut bangs into the hair! Once hair reaches the collar, it can be evened up around the perimeter into a bob. From there minimum maintenance is required to keep it growing. How Fast Does Hair Grow? Q: How fast does hair grow? A: The speed of hair growth is roughly 1.25 centimeters or 0.5 inches per month, being about 15 centimeters or 6 inches per year. With age the speed of hairgrowth might slow down to as little as 0.25 cm or 0.1 inch a month. Cell division is responsible for the hair growth cycle. The new cells push the hair forward to make it longer, so the new hair is added at the root. There are about 100.000 hairs on a healthy scalp of hair. Each of these hairs will, in normal healthy conditions, last for one up to six years. People loose about 100 hairs per day, in normal conditions. The only part of your body that grows faster is bone marrow, the soft stuff inside your bones. The hair on your head grows about 6 inches a year. So, even though it's one of the fastest-growing things on your body, it takes a while to grow it really long. You lose about 50 to 100 hairs a day. That's because the follicles don't all grow hair at the same time. Each scalp follicle grows hair for a few years and then takes a break. When a follicle is on a break, the hair in the follicle falls out. With over 200 ingredients including a 20 plus fruit and vegetable complex with Biotin and Inositol, this product is sure to boost her hair growth results amongst other benefits of setting up a good healthy hair growth foundation from the inside out. This tasty liquid hair vitamin is gluten free and vegetarian. The anagen phase is known as the growth phase. It begins in the papilla and can last from two to six years. The span at which the hair remains in this stage of growth is determined by genetics. The longer the hair stays in the anagen phase, the longer it will grow. There are steps that you can do to help your child’s hair grow back. The first step is to take Mielle Organics children’s hair and health formula. We have a good recommended dose of vitamin A, zinc, folic acid and biotin. Along with other minerals to support a healthy immune system. Brush out your child’s hair while the conditioner is still in her hair or use a detangling solution if she is prone to knots. You can make your own inexpensive detangler at home. Just fill a spray bottle approximately three-quarters full of distilled water and a spoonful or two of her conditioner. A child’s hair will grow about one quarter inch each month. The hair will grow out of follicles for two to six years before entering a rest phase that lasts about three months. Following the rest phase the hair will fall out, with 50 to 100 strands a day being a normal rate of hair loss. Kids who have large follicles will have thick hair. Kids with narrow follicles will have fine hair. Many factors can affect hair growth, including nutrition and health conditions. It is thought that this hair loss occurs because the original stressor pushes the child's hair into a resting or dormant phase, instead of its more usual long growth phase. It then falls out until new hair grows and then follows the normal growth phases for hair. Alopecia areata often starts suddenly and causes patchy hair loss in children and young adults. This condition may result in complete baldness (alopecia totalis). But in about 90% of people with the condition, the hair returns within a few years. Query: how long does children hair growth",

You'll need to see a doctor for diagnosis of strep throat — they can perform a quick test to determine if it is, in fact, the cause of your illness. If it is strep, they'll prescribe antibiotics to help kill the bacteria. When to See a Doctor Few common illnesses are more unpleasant than the flu. The aches and pains, chills, fever, and cough are bad enough; add in the other potential symptoms of flu, including runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, or sore throat, and you'll want the illness to be over as soon as possible. How long does the flu last? And does treating flu help make it go away faster? How long will the influenza last? Usually, influenza lasts three to five days. If it goes on for more than a week or if the symptoms are very severe, you are advised to consult your doctor. A bad case of influenza has the potential to develop into a more serious condition like pneumonia or sinus trouble, and in rare cases it can be life-threatening. Flu symptoms usually start within one to four days after infection. Unlike a common cold, the effects of an influenza virus infection can come on very suddenly. The first signs of the flu are often a fever or chills, accompanied by headache, sore throat, dry cough, runny nose, muscle aches, and fatigue. As the illness progresses, a person may have warm, flushed skin, watery or bloodshot eyes, a severe cough that produces phlegm, and nasal congestion. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: Fever* or feeling feverish/chills; Cough; Sore throat; Runny or stuffy nose; Muscle or body aches; Headaches; Fatigue (tiredness) Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. * It’s important to note that not everyone with flu will have a ...

Even in ice water hypothermia does not set until after 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the can someone explain me what is hypothermia, and how it kill people? How long take for in, an adult who submerge She was totally fine in a few hours, but man was I scared.”. Hypothermia can be a serious, life threatening condition. Knowing what the signs are can save your pet’s life. We usually associate hypothermia with winter time and cold temperatures, but as my friend’s story shows, it can happen inside the house as well. Surprisingly, hypothermia can occur at any temperature lower than normal body temperature. Factors like body fat, age, alcohol consumption, and especially wetness can affect how long hypothermia takes to strike. If you fall into water, the situation becomes drastically more dangerous. For example, in water 32.5 degrees Fahrenheit or colder, you might not survive more than 15-to-45 minutes. – Preventing hypothermia. Preventing hypothermia is much easier than treating it, so: don’t leave your dog outside for long periods of time without letting him have access to a warm dry shelter; if you do take your dog out for exercise during cold weather try to do it little and often and consider investing in a coat and booties for your dog; Quick Answer. The onset time of hypothermia varies greatly depending on the individual and upon circumstance. It is possible for a dry person to be exposed to cold temperatures for many hours or even days before hypothermia sets in. In contrast, Minnesota Sea Grant reports that a person in water succumbs to hypothermia in as little as 30 minutes when submerged in temperatures between 32.5 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. a naked wet person sitting in the open on a windy night will get frost bite in minutes, hypothermia in less than 30, dead soon after, prob less than an hour. An clothed and active person in shelter might survive many hours. Probably until they tire out and sit or sleep. Hypothermia can take seconds or hours to set in, depending on the temperature of the water. I'm not sure how much for a dog, but for a human it can take as little as in 2 minutes. One Minute. 1  Once you fall into cold water, you will hyperventilate for one minute. 2  Take the time to get control of your breath and keep your head clear of the water. 3  Don’t panic. 4  Take stock of your surroundings and plan your next steps. The chart also includes a frostbite indicator, showing the points where temperature, wind speed and exposure time will produce frostbite on humans. Each of the three shaded area shows how long a person can be exposed before frostbite develops. For example, a temperature of 0°F and a wind speed of 15 mph will produce a wind chill temperature of -19°F. How cold does the water have to be to put a person at risk for hypothermia? Even water temperatures as high as 75 and 80 degrees F (24 and 27 degrees C) can be dangerous, but it would most likely take much longer than 15 minutes to become debilitated. There is no set time for when hypothermia will set in, but generally the colder the water, the faster it happens. So if you find yourself submerged in icy-cold water, what should you do? If you have a flotation device, you should get on top of that device and hug yourself to keep as much of your body away from the water as possible. Best Answer: probably pretty fast ...

For an average Eagle it would have a time for about 32-36 days, but the average time for an Eagle egg to hatch is about 35 days. Edit The chicks hatch from the eggs without any help from the parents. The chick uses its egg tooth to scratch around the inside of the shell in a circular path. The scratches weaken the shell in a pattern all around the egg. This is called pipping, and it can take from one to two days. A pip is considered to be a crack in the egg’s shell and shows up as the eaglet begins to emerge. Experts said it could take between 12 and 48 hours for an eaglet to completely emerge from the shell. A second egg is expected to hatch as soon as this weekend, eagle experts said. On Thursday, the foundation sent out pictures and updates throughout the day. when bald eagle eggs don’t hatch Already this season of Bald Eagle watching, we have witnessed the sad circumstance of eggs not hatching: both eggs of the two-egg clutch at the Sequoyah National Wildlife Refuge nest in Oklahoma, and one of the two eggs at the Jordan Lake nest in North Carolina (it is impossible to know whether it was the first or second of the clutch since the egg-laying dates are unknown there).

There is about 25 mL of air (80% nitrogen & 20% oxygen) in the flask. The bubbles of oxygen that are forming will displace the air by pushing it out of the flask. Oxygen is a little more dense than air, so oxygen will stay closer to the surface of the water and push the air out of the flask. Wait about 2 minutes before placing the stopper onto the flask. That will give the newly created oxygen to push the most of the air out of the flask. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.)

However, they may have fewer features of the condition due to the presence of some (or many) cells with a typical number of chromosomes. Down syndrome is a set of physical and mental traits caused by a gene problem that happens before birth. Children who have Down syndrome tend to have certain features, such as a flat face and a short neck. Chromosomes R Us - English (Video) This is a short film by actors with Down syndrome explaining how Trisomy 21 occurs. Made by Shabang Inclusive Learning in collaboration with Mediapreview. Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK. This film was made possible by generous funding from BBC Children in Need. Down syndrome can be diagnosed in infancy based on the characteristic clinical findings. When Down syndrome is suspected in a person, a genetic test called a chromosome analysis is performed on a blood or skin sample to look for an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). Trisomy 21 means that each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies. Having an extra number 21 chromosome interrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic clinical features of Down syndrome. Down syndrome can be caused by one of three types of abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21. The three genetic variations include: Trisomy 21– More than 90% of Down syndrome cases are caused by trisomy 21. An extra chromosome (chromosome 21) originates in the development of either the sperm or the egg. When the egg and the sperm unite to form the fertilized egg, three (rather than two) chromosomes 21 are present. Any one of three genetic variations can cause Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. About 95 percent of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 — the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies, in all cells. This is caused by abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell. Mosaic Down syndrome. You may decide to have: 1  Screening tests, such as an ultrasound or a blood test during your first or second trimester. These can help show if the developing baby (fetus) is at risk for Down syndrome. 2  Diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These can show if a baby has Down syndrome. Down Syndrome Causes and Symptoms. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder in which, most often, a third copy of chromosome 21 is present in cells because of an abnormal cell division when the egg and sperm first meet. The complications of living with Down syndrome can range in severity to mild to extreme and may include the following: 1  Thyroid disease. 2  Heart defects. 3  Infectious diseases. 4  Sleep apnea. 5  Obesity. 6  Seizures. 7  Hearing loss. 8  Premature aging. 9  Skeletal problems. 10  Inability to care for one’s self. The risk for someone with tranlocation trisomy 21 passing on the condition to a child is roughly 10 to 15 percent for women and three percent for men. Since translocation trisomy 21 only accounts for around four percent of people with Down syndrome, less than one percent of cases would be considered hereditary.

The basic information explains corn growth and development through one life cycle. (Corn will not germinate if soil temperature is less than 55 F.) To speed increase in soil temperature, consider covering soil with black plastic for several weeks before planting. Plant in blocks of at least 4 rows of a single hybrid (as opposed to fewer, longer rows) for good pollination and well-filled ears. (Some corn varieties need to be isolated from others. See variety information below.) Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 4 to 6 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart. The size of your corn plants will vary with the type of corn you are growing and the growing conditions, but most corn plants average 6 - 8 ft. tall. There are shorter varieties, for gardens with limited space. Step 1, Buy some fertile popcorn seeds. You can use plain popcorn from a bag, but you will want to do a fertility test first. Not all store-bought popcorn will be fertile because of the heating and sterilization processes popcorn goes through before being packaged and sold.

It takes anywhere between 58 days to over 100 days to harvest corn, depending upon the variety and the ear size. There are many different varieties of corn, some of which are heirloom and others that are hybrids. The maturity dates are relative to the type. The actual number of days to harvest varies also from year to year and location to location. It takes anywhere between 58 days to over 100 days to harvest corn, depending upon the variety and the ear size. Suckers may also develop from corn plants, and sometimes they may even produce an ear. Usually two ears grow on each corn plant. Once pollinated, corn matures rapidly, usually 15-20 days after the first silks appear. Cultivating Corn.

As a planet rotates around its axis, the stars appear to move around a projection of the planet's axis into space. The time required for the stars to move once around their paths is called the sidereal period of rotation, or the rotation period of the planet. While the planet rotates, it is also moving around the Sun. How long does it take for each planet to rotate on its axis? mercury : 59 days venus: 243 days earth: 24 hours mars: 24.3 hours jupiter: 9.8 hours saturn: 10.2 hours uranus: 17.14 hours neptune: 16 hours 1 day. When we come to Uranus, the question of how long a day is becomes a bit complicated. One the one hand, the planet has a sidereal rotation period of 17 hours 14 minutes and 24 seconds, which is the equivalent of 0.71833 Earth days. So you could say a day on Uranus lasts almost as long as a day on Earth. It would be true, were it not for the extreme axial tilt this gas/ice giant has going on. A tidally locked body like the Moon of course does rotate; it just rotates at the same rate as its revolution around the primary. Tidal locking occurs because the mass of the Moon is not uniformly distributed; the Earth's gravity acts unevenly on it, so it falls into a locked configuration. Best Answer: This site has a table that lists all planets and their rotation times as well as other info.... http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tab... Rotation is ... How long does take for the moon to rotate on its axis? The moon has an axis, and as the moon orbits the Earth, it keeps the same face toward the earth.

What event defined the formation of the sun in our solar system. The beginning of nuclear fusion in the suns core releasing large amounts of energy. In short, our planet takes 365.2564 solar days to complete a single orbit of the Sun, which is why we add an extra day to the calendar every four years (i.e. a Leap Year, which 2016 happens to be). But because our axis is tilted, there is considerable variation in the seasons during the course of a year. Observers on Earth might notice that the moon essentially keeps the same side facing our planet as it passes through its orbit. This may lead to the question, does the moon rotate? The answer is yes, though it may seem contrary to what our eyes observe. The 'dark' side of the moon. The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis. As a result, the moon does not seem to be spinning but appears to observers from Earth to be keeping almost perfectly still. Scientists call this sychronous rotation.

Yoga and meditation experts may hold breath for longer than this, but these are very rare examples. In an absence of oxygen, brain cells begin to die and this effect is irreversible! The brain cannot go without oxygen for more than ten minutes. If oxygen is not able to get to the brain before this, then there is a possibility of irreversible brain damage. The brain cannot go without oxygen for more than ten minutes. If oxygen is not able to get to the brain before this, then there is a possibility of irreversible brain damage. How long can someone go without oxygen before there is brain damage ? If someone has been without oxygen for 15 minutes is there any hope that they can wake from a coma without any brain damage.

Below are some frequently asked questions about brain death, how organ donation works, the need for donors, organ failure, and transplantation. 1. What do medical personnel do to save the life of a person with a head injury? 2. What kinds of injuries may lead to brain death? 3. How long can the brain go without oxygen before serious damage occurs? 4. What happens when your brain is injured? 5. What can be done if your brain is injured? 6. What is brain death? Doesn't the person's heart have to stop for them to be dead? 7. How can you tell if someone is brain dead? 8. What does a brain dead person look like? 9. If the person is brain dead how can the heart still be beating? 10. 3. How long can the brain go without oxygen before serious damage occurs? After five to ten minutes of not breathing, you are likely to develop serious and possibly irreversible brain damage. The one exception is when a younger person stops breathing and also becomes very cold at the same time. This can occur when a child is suddenly plunged into very cold water and drowns. In this situation, survival after more than 30 minutes has been known to occur. Return to the list of Frequently Asked Questions >> So expect a minute at most before permanent brain damage, and maybe 3 minutes at max before total death. And if you want to experience having overly oxygen-rich blood, take a few deep, meditative breaths. Humans are aerobic creatures, meaning we require oxygen to release energy and exist. Without oxygen, our cells wouldn’t be able to release the energy in the food we eat, and we would die. We take in oxygen through respiration — we move air in and out of the lungs, and blood takes oxygen to the cells of the body. Carbon dioxide, a waste product in our bodies, is moved out of the body by the same system. Breathing has always been synonymous with life. Our speech is permeated with idioms and phrases relying on the idea that taking a breath is the surest sign of vitality, and we constantly compare things we need to our body’s ultimate necessity: oxygen. Under relatively normal circumstances, we start struggling after a few minutes without oxygen. Without being able to convert energy and use it up, cells start to die. This happens throughout the entire body, but it is the brain’s lack of oxygen that is most urgent. “The brain is a highly metabolically active organ,” Tishler said. “It needs oxygen to generate the energy to function. Without the energy (without oxygen) it dies.” The brain normally takes up about 20 percent of the body’s oxygen. If it doesn’t get what it needs, cells begin dying off, putting a person at risk of permanent brain damage. If a person suffocates, or suffers another type of involuntary oxygen deprivation, they’ll ultimately suffer brain death: the utter, irreversible loss of brain function. It’s a pretty unavoidable succession of events. Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness. At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying. At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely. At five minutes, death becomes imminent. At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable. At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder held his breath for 22 minutes without sustaining brain damage!

This is length of time sperm normally spends in uterus. Fertilization takes place in fallopian tubes ; embryo inplants in the womb. To become pregnant, the following steps must occur: 1  Sperm Transport — The sperm must be deposited and transported to the site of fertilization. 2  Egg Transport — Ovulation must occur and the egg must be picked up by the tube. 3  Fertilization and Embryo Development — Union between the sperm and egg must result. Since sperm can live in a woman’s body for up to five days, and the egg can only live for 12-24 hours, it makes sense to have the sperm “ready and waiting” when the egg is released, if a couple is trying to get pregnant. These enzymes quickly destroy any sperm that can’t swim out of the semen within a few hours. It takes approximately 72 days for sperm to mature in the body. During the last 14 days of this process, the sperm are very much alive and swimming. They are alive a long time prior to leaving a man’s body. During freezing, sperm are cooled to a very low sub zero temperature (minus 196 degrees Centigrade). In brief: Up to 72 hours.

            "input": "If the Earth didn't rotate, winds would travel either north or south due to differences in temperature and pressure at different latitudes. But since the Earth does rotate, the Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Keep Reading Below In the Northern Hemisphere, this deflection causes the wind flow around high pressure systems to go clockwise while flow around low-pressure systems travels counterclockwise. Global winds. Earth’s orbit around the sun and its rotation on a tilted axis causes some parts of Earth to receive more solar radiation than others. This uneven heating produces global circulation patterns. offsite link For example, the Since aircraft cover large distances in a short period of time, pilots must also take its influence into account when charting the paths for their flights. For instance, a plane headed from Miami (where the Earth's rotation is more pronounced) to New York would end up in the Atlantic Ocean if the pilot ignored the effects of the Earth's rotation. 1 2 How do temp & salinity affect the formation of deep currents The colder the temp of water is the higher amound of salinity in the water which makes the water more dense Disasters caused by el niño These global wind patterns drive large bodies of air called air masses. Air masses are thousands of feet thick and extend across large areas of the Earth. The location over which an air mass forms will determine its characteristics. For example, air over the tropical ocean becomes exceptionally hot and humid. Global winds. Earth’s orbit around the sun and its rotation on a tilted axis causes some parts of Earth to receive more solar radiation than others. This uneven heating produces global circulation patterns.offsite link For example, the abundance of energy reaching the equator produces hot humid air that rises high into the atmosphere. With a high-pressure system, air gets forced outward and the Earth's eastward spin creates a clockwise flow. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite takes place: Wind around low-pressure systems circles clockwise while wind around high-pressure systems circles counterclockwise. How do continential deflections affect surface currents The shape of continents affect what direction the surface currents go How does temp affect surface cutrents Warm water currents begin at the equator & cold water currents begin closer to the poles Coriolis effect. As they travel across the Earth, air masses and global winds do not move in straight lines. Similar to a person trying to walk straight across a spinning Merry-Go-Round, winds get deflected from a straight-line path as they blow across the rotating Earth.

There are two-year on-campus and online programs as well as accelerated programs, part-time, and dual degree programs that vary in length. The typical master's degree program takes two years of full-time study to complete. There are also part-time programs that take longer, as well as accelerated master's degree programs that take less time. In the instance of dual degree programs, the length of time to receive a master's degree depends on the additional degree program, and may take as few as four years or as many as ten. In some subjects, master's degrees are considered terminal degrees, and graduates receive the advanced training necessary to enter or advance in a chosen profession. Considering the fact that a professional with a Master’s degree earns about 20% more in their lifetime than other professionals with a lower level degree. If you are wondering how long it takes to earn your Master’s degree, read this guide and learn what you need to know.

Children under 9 years old need two doses of the vaccine the first year they get it. The flu can take many forms. Classically, the flu begins abruptly, with a fever in the 102 to 106 degree range, a flushed face, body aches, and marked lack of energy. Some people have other systemic symptoms such as dizziness or vomiting. The fever usually lasts for a day or two, but can last five days.

Once you’ve found a home and signed a contract with the seller, the rest of the lending process might take two or three weeks on the short end, or two to three months on the long end. There are many variables and several different people involved. I work with a lot of HUD homes and closings. HUD requires the home to be closed within 45 days. If you are paying cash you can close much faster. Are you closing with the HUD attorney? Fearnley, Calif, & Price? If so they should be able to clear title quickly because they already have all the information. Most federally related mortgage loans can close within 30 days. Special first-time home buyer programs, particularly those involving help with the buyer's down payment, might take 35 to 45 days to close. These special loans typically require approval from two underwriting processes. HUD, though, understands that even pre-approved winning bidders on its homes will need time to close. Additionally, HUD also needs time to write up and send contracts to the real estate brokers of winning home bidders. Due to the time needed by all involved parties, HUD generally allows winning home bidders with mortgages up to 45 days to close.

            "input": "Rock cycle. The rock cycle is a basic concept in geology that describes the time-consuming transitions through geologic time among the three main rock types: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous. As the adjacent diagram illustrates, each of the types of rocks is altered or destroyed when it is forced out of its equilibrium conditions. An igneous rock such as basalt may break down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain in equilibrium and are forced to change as they encounter new environments. The rock cycle is an illustration that explains how the three rock types are related to each other, and how processes change from one type to another over time. This cyclical aspect makes rock change a geologic cycle and, on planets containing life, a biogeochemical cycle During the rock cycle process, sedimentary rocks can become metamorphic or igneous rocks as they are buried in the planet's crust with younger layers of rock above them. Eventually they can metamorphose under heat and pressure at great depth, or melt to form new magma. Uplifting of rock layers by earth forces can bring rocks near the surface again at any point in the cycle. Igneous and metamorphic rocks can weather to form sediments that later become sedimentary rocks. Igneous rocks can metamorphose when subjected again to heat and pressure. Metamorphic rocks can metamorphose in repeat episodes or melt into magma, which later cools to form igneous rocks. Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro. The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine-grained rock while gabbro is a coarse-grained rock. Basalt (pronounced /bəˈsɔːlt/, /ˈbæsɒlt/ or /ˈbæsɔːlt/) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. A: Basalt is primarily formed by the extrusion of lava flows onto the surface of the earth during a volcanic eruption. The intrusion of a narrow sill or igneous dike below the crust also results in the formation of basalt. Basalt is a type of igneous rock that is typically dark in coloration with a fine-grained texture. It is the most predominant rock type found in Earth's crust, and mainly consists of pyroxene and plagioclase minerals. Volcanoes that form basalt are commonly found near the ocean basins. IGNEOUS ROCKS (obsidian, granite, scoria, basalt) - all samples seem to be hard and not breakable. GRANITE: Granite is an igneous rock that cooled very slowly. We know this because the minerals in granite are very large. It takes a long time (hundreds of thousands of years) for rocks to grow to visible size. BASALT: Basalt cooled more quickly than granite. A type of igneous rock. Basalt is the most common rock type in the earth's crust and makes up most of the ocean floor. A process that turns sediment into sedimentary rock. Over time, sediment accumulates in oceans, lakes, and valleys, eventually building up in layers and weighing down the material underneath. Molten rock that flows beneath the earth's surface and is made up of gases, liquids, and crystals. When magma reaches the surface, it is called lava. Marble A type of metamorphic rock formed when limestone is pushed down into the earth and subjected to intense heat and pressure for a long period of time. Melting dating: The global tectonic rock cycle …that allow black lava, called basalt, to reach the surface. The portion that remains in a fissure below the surface usually forms a vertical black tubular body known as a dike (or dyke). Basalt Rocks Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock that is very dark in color. It is the most common type of rock in the Earth's crust and it makes up most of the ocean floor. It is made of many dark colored minerals such as pyroxene and olivine. Basalt also contains some light colored minerals such as feldspar and quartz, but the amounts are small.

Grapes are certainly a multi-purpose fruit, being used for wine, baked goods, jams, and for eating fresh off the vine. With their ability to grow in many places around the world, they are a great addition to any garden. But for the most part, every wine harvest includes these basic vine-to-wine steps: 1  Pick the grapes. 2  Crush the grapes. 3  Ferment the grapes into wine. 4  Age the wine. 5  Bottle the wine. Pruning is one of the most important factors in grape production. Grapes develop only on new growth, which sprouts from 1-year-old wood. This is one reason why most vines don't produce grapes in their second year -- the whole plant is only 1 year old, so its main job is support instead of grapes. A: It normally takes between two to three weeks for grapes to fully ferment into wine after being crushed. The fermentation occurs in two stages, primary and secondary fermentation. In general, primary fermentation usually lasts about three to seven days. will prepare the site before you plant. Choosing a site The first step toward consistent production of high-quality grapes is to choose a sunny place to plant. While some ornamental grapevine species perform adequately in partial shade, full sunlight is required to get good production of table grapes. After they're frozen solid, pack grapes into freezer bags or containers. To remove air from bags, use a vacuum sealer or the straw method. Stick a straw into an edge of the bag opening, seal the bag right up to the straw, and suck the remaining air out of the bag. Seal the bag as you quickly withdraw the straw. To keep things simple, this stage mainly includes: 1  red and white wines: yeast is added to the vats so that fermentation can take place. 2  red wines: carbon dioxide is released during fermentation which causes the grape skins to rise to the surface. 3  red wines: the grapes are pressed after fermentation is complete. In late years, grapes. are often picked in late October. Consider the variance in harvest time for Morningside. Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon for the last four years: Oct 4, Oct 11, Sept 30 and Sept 13. Grapes can be stored for up to six weeks in the cellar, but grapes can absorb the odors of other fruits and vegetables, so keep them separate. Use cardboard boxes or crates lined with clean, dry straw. Another kid-friendly idea is to thread red, green, and purple grapes before freezing to make a frozen treat on a string. You can also use frozen grapes to replace fresh grapes in recipes, including jam. You can puree grapes before freezing, and freeze the puree in ice cube trays. Pack the grape cubes in freezer bags. These cubes make a great addition for chilling drinks like juices, teas, or lemonade without watering them down. For best quality, eat frozen grapes—chunks or puree—within nine to 12 months.

I have just ordered a new prescription. According to the instructions, I will need 4 drops per day. 1 drop each for the small toes and 2 drops for the large toe. I have found that the 4 ml bottle runs out of medicine after three weeks. I am getting about 80 drops out of each bottle, but the pharmacy says there should be 200 drops per bottle. I am not getting close to 200. There is no information provided with the prescription as to how many doses are in each bottle.

So you’re probably asking, what is Apetamin? It’s a vitamin syrup that works to enhance your appetite. For me in particular this was key because I have a very weak appetite. I’m talking I could literally eat once a day, with one little bottle of something to drink to help wash it down. Totally unhealthy, and not helpful to gaining weight. In fact, this habit is what helped me lose weight. Taking just 10ml of the apetamin syrup 3x before meals enabled me to eat an entire plate and still have room for more. The weight gain wasted no time following the new habit. My weight prior to starting the apetamin was 128.5lbs, 5 days into taking it I weighed 134.3lbs. That’s 6lbs in 5 days!!! Unbelievable, I know. One (1) bottle of Apetamin lasts approximately one week. The sleepiness or drowsiness usually occurs the first few days of taking Apetamin and will decrease thereafter. The Manufacturer's recommended adult dosage of Apetamin syrup is 10-15mL three times a day, take 10 to 30 minutes before meals. Does Apetamin make you sleepy? Yes, Apetamin can cause sleepiness or drowsiness for the first few days. If you stop using it and start up again you will most likely be sleepy again the first few days. Besides that if you use it regularly it will not effect your sleep schedule. How long does one (1) bottle last? One (1) bottle of Apetamin lasts approximately 7-10 Days, we suggest ordering your next bottle when your current bottle is at it’s half way point. Do I need to refrigerate Apetamin? It is recommended that Apetamin be stored at a temperature to be protected from sunlight & UV rays. A cool dark cabinet or draw is fine but it can stay in room temperature after opening for up to 2 weeks (if your taking your Apetamin correctly it should only last for a week [7-10 days]) Will I lose weight if I ... You will use approx. 1 bottle per week if you have two big toes and 5 small toes infected. Less if all toes are affected. I wrote a complaint to the review board of my insurance company and they filled my prescription to meet the 1 bottle per week need. Fast Acting Apetamin’s fast acting formula will have you seeing results in as little as 1 week. How soon should I see results? Apetamin will increase your appetite in just 2 days. You will start gaining in one week. Can I take if I’m breastfeeding or pregnant? No, Apetamin can’t be taken if pregnant or breast feeding. Please consult with your physician regarding any medical questions. Does Apetamin syrup need to be refrigerated? No, please store in a dark, cool place. Preferably a cabinet.

If you include residency and fellowship, you will need at least 7 years from the first day of medical school before you can practice medicine in the United States. If you are specializing, it will most likely take longer. The good news is that this is the final exam in the USMLE series, which is designed to assess whether a medical school graduate can apply medical knowledge and understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine. The first two years of medical school cover the basic medical (preclinical) sciences while the last four years are focused on the clinical sciences and internship. For me, it began in college, taking rigorous pre-medical courses against a large yearly burden of tuition: $27,000 of debt yearly for four years. I was one of the fortunate ones. If courses completed in her master's program meet the prerequisite requirements for medical school, she may be able to go straight from practicing as an NP to medical school. In some cases, however, she may need to repeat a course or take an additional course or courses to qualify for medical school. The four years of medical school is divided into two. The first two years are for spending times in classrooms and laboratories, taking anatomy courses, microbiology courses, pathology courses, pharmacology, biology, physiology, and more. Four years of medical school This is the traditional path, but there are alternative paths to becoming a pediatrician. These numbers don't include an extra year or two to finish college or medical school if you want to spread out your studies or you have a gap year between them. At the end of medical school, you can receive your medical degree and apply for a medical license. Applying to Medical School with AMCAS®. The American Medical College Application Service® (AMCAS®) is the AAMC's centralized medical school application processing service. Most U.S. medical schools use AMCAS as the primary application method for their first-year entering classes. Medical School. Most medical schools are four-year programs, although a few offer combined undergraduate and medical school curriculums that last six or seven years. For surgeons, the training after medical school may last as long as 8 or 9 years, if additional training after residency is required. Training often starts with a general surgery residency, which is takes five years (the intern year and an additional four years of surgical residency. Query: how long in medical school",

            "input": "A more pronounced tide, when high tides are very high and low tides are very low, is called a “spring tide.” These periods occur during the New Moon, when the Sun and Moon are lined up on the same side of the Earth, and the Full Moon, when the Moon and Sun are on opposite sides of the Earth. Together, the gravitational effects of the moon and the sun affect the Earth’s tides on a monthly basis. Click the image to see an animation. The moon is a major influence on the Earth’s tides, but the sun also generates considerable tidal forces. Solar tides are about half as large as lunar tides and are expressed as a variation of lunar tidal patterns, not as a separate set of tides. The Earth experiences two high tides per day because of the difference in the Moon's gravitational field at the Earth's surface and at its center. You could say that there is a high tide on the side nearest the Moon because the Moon pulls the water away from the Earth, and a high tide on the opposite side because the Moon pulls the Earth away from the water on the far side. The moon is the dominate tidal influence. The moon's tidal influence is about twice that of the sun. Remember, tides are due to a non-uniform gravitational field, squishing and squashing on a body in free motion within the gravitational field. The height of the tides is also affected by the position of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth. The Moon travels around the Earth once every 28 days. Depending on where it is on its journey, the difference between high and low tide may be more or less pronounced. Sun's Tidal Effect. Even though the Sun is 391 times as far away from the Earth as the Moon, its force on the Earth is about 175 times as large. Yet its tidal effect is smaller than that of the Moon because tides are caused by the difference in gravity field across the Earth. The Earth's diameter is such a small fraction of the Sun-Earth distance that the gravity field changes by only a factor of 1.00017 across the Earth. The elliptial orbits of the moon around the Earth and the Earth around the sun have substantial effects on the earth’s tides. Click the image for a larger view. Just as the angles of the sun, moon and Earth affect tidal heights over the course of a lunar month, so do their distances to one another. The actual force differential across the Earth is 0.00017 x 174.5 = 0.03 times the Moon's force, compared to 0.068 difference across the Earth for the Moon's force. The actual tidal influence then is then 44% of that of the Moon. The Moon is the dominant tidal influence because the fractional difference in its force across the Earth is greater than the fractional difference seen from the Sun. This difference in force follows the inverse square law. Tides are the natural rise and fall that occurs in major bodies of water, such as the ocean or large lakes. Tides are caused by the gravitational relationship between the Moon and the Earth. The Moon’s gravity pulls on the Earth, causing the water to swell in the direction of the Moon. The exact timing and number of high tides per day varies by location, and is affected by such factors as geography, the shape of the coastline, the salinity of the water, the time of year, and the weather, among other things.

The game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure possession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. NCAA games are comprised of two 20-minute halves. 1  In both the NBA and NCAA, an overtime period is five minutes. 2  An NBA three is taken from 23'9 (or 22 in the corners). 3  Once in the double-bonus, fouling to stop the clock is a riskier play.

This is the same for the WNBA and international games. 3  NBA - NBA games are made up of four 12-minute quarters. Sporting Charts explains Shot Clock The shot clock resets when the ball touches the rim. In the NBA, when a foul is called and there are fewer than 13 seconds on the shot clock, the shot clock resets to 14 seconds. The implementation of the shot clock in 1954 is arguably the most important rule change in the history of the NBA. Since professional basketball games were 48 minutes long, Biasone divided 2880 (the number of seconds in 48 minutes) by 120 (the total number of shots taken per game when each team attempted 60 shots) and arrived at an optimal figure of one shot every 24 seconds. The 24-second shot clock made an immediate impact. In 1954-55, its first season, NBA teams averaged 93.1 points, an increase of 13.6 points over the previous season. The Boston Celtics became the first team in NBA history to average more than 100 points per game for a season, and three years later, every team did it. “Pro basketball would not have survived without a clock,” said Biasone. In the NBA (since 1954), Women's National Basketball Association (since 2006), and FIBA play (since 2000; 30-second from 1956 to 2000), the shot clock counts down 24 seconds, thus often being called the 24-second clock. On April 22, 1954, facing a scoring drought of epic proportions, NBA owners voted to implement a 24-second shot clock. The decision changed the league and the game of basketball. Before that vote, the NBA had a problem: a low-scoring, time-killing breed of basketball was taking over the league. In Game 7, Syracuse's George King made one of two foul shots with 12 seconds left, then stole the ball to seal a 92-91 victory. BIASONE 'S INVENTION RESCUES THE LEAGUE Danny Biasone will always have a place in NBA history as the man who invented the shot clock. When the ball is inbound, the clock starts once a player touches the ball. In the NBA the clock stops after a made shot during the last two minutes of the game and overtime. For college it stops during the last minute of the game and overtime. Overtime If the game is tied after regulation time, there will be overtime. Overtime is 5 minutes long in most leagues. Additional overtimes will be added until one team ends up on top. The Shot Clock In order to speed up the game and to prevent teams from stalling, a shot clock was added. This is how long you have to shoot the ball. If the ball changes possession or hits the rim of the basket, the shot clock starts over.

The methodology of grounded theory, which primarily uses inductive analysis, is qualitative, meaning it is an open approach to research (Bowen, 2006). Recruitment (hiring) is a core function of human resource management. It is the first step of appointment. Recruitment refers to the overall process of attracting, shortlisting, selecting and appointing suitable candidates for jobs (either permanent or temporary) within an organization. Understanding the methodology of grounded theory can assist researchers in expanding. the knowledge and application of the human resource management practices of recruitment and. retention beyond the bounds of traditional theories and methodologies. Recruitment is the process of finding and hiring the most qualified internal or external candidates for a job. Recruitment includes a four-tiered process.

These theories will be used as the theoretical background for the whole thesis. The second objective is to study about the current recruitment and reten- tion strategy on Aiya. In order to realize company objectives, it is essential to recruit people with requisite skills, qualification and experience. While doing so we need to keep present and future requirements of company in mind. Successful recruitment methods include a thorough analysis of the job and the labour market conditions.

Always cook or freeze the chicken within two days of bringing it home, regardless of what the package date tells you. Never store raw chicken in the refrigerator at home for longer than two days. Once you've cleared up what belongs where, the next step is knowing how long the food will last. Storing food is a delicate matter -- in the fridge, food might get moist and moldy, and in the freezer it could lose all its moisture or get freezer burn. If you leave food in the fridge or freezer too long, it could not only lose its integrity but it may also become unsafe to eat.

Thanks for your help, SS. Dear SS: According to Foodsafety.gov, whole, uncooked poultry (chicken or turkey) is safe in the refrigerator for 1-2 days and safe in the freezer for up to 12 months. Poultry pieces are safe in the refrigerator for 1-2 days and safe in the freezer for up to nine months. Cooked poultry is safe refrigerated for 3-4 days and in the freezer for 2-6 months. You can also freeze your cooked breaded chicken cutlets (Foodsafety.gov specifically lists nuggets and patties) for 1-3 months. How long can you keep chicken in the fridge? Raw chicken: You'll need to either cook or freeze it fast. According to recommendations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, raw chicken will only keep in the refrigerator for about 1-2 days. (Same goes for turkey and other poultry.) If you store it in the freezer in a sealed, freezer-safe container or vacuum-sealed package, it should stay safe to thaw and eat for up to 9 months, in pieces, or up to 12 months, for a whole chicken. Cooked chicken: You have a little more time, but not much. I have to say that I have kept chicken in the fridge for longer than 2 days and not died. Some even have best before dates 3-4 days in. The quality definitely suffers, and I'm sure there's some risk, but it's probably low. How long does raw chicken last after being frozen and thawed? Chicken that has been defrosted in the fridge can be kept for an additional 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator before cooking; chicken that was thawed in the microwave or in cold water should be cooked immediately.

Mild TBI Symptoms A traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be classified as mild if loss of consciousness and/or confusion and disorientation is shorter than 30 minutes. While MRI and CAT scans are often normal, the individual has cognitive problems such as headache, difficulty thinking, memory problems, attention deficits, mood swings and frustration. Other Symptoms Associated with Mild TBI. 1  Nausea. 2  Loss of smell. 3  Sensitivity to light and sounds. 4  Mood changes. 5  Getting lost or confused. 6  Slowness in thinking.

To be efficient as a So that vehicle owners understand the importance of an exhaust system and the connected muffler, here is some basic information to explain the purpose of two main components, the Emissions Control System and the Catalytic Converter! The catalytic converter looks like a muffler and is located in the exhaust system in front of the muffler. Simply stated, hydrocarbons or carbon monoxide in the exhaust are converted to carbon dioxide and water as they pass over the catalyst. Heat is generated in the converter as it works to clean the exhaust. Muffler, also called silencer, device through which the exhaust gases from an internal-combustion engine are passed to attenuate (reduce) the airborne noise of the engine. To be efficient as a sound reducer, a muffler must decrease the velocity of the exhaust gases and either absorb sound waves or cancel them by interference with reflected waves coming from the same source. In the typical reactive design shown in the , the arrows indicate the flow of exhaust gas through a set of tubes and chambers inside the muffler. One important chamber is known as the Helmholtz resonator. This chamber is of a dimension carefully tuned to reflect and cancel sound waves of specified frequencies.

The bat is shaped like a paddle, with one side having a deep V (back) and the other side flat, called the blade. Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket field, at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a target at each end called the wicket. Each phase of play is called an innings, during which one team bats, attempting to score as many runs as possible, whilst their opponents bowl and field, attempting to minimise the number of runs scored. When each innings ends, the teams usually swap roles for the next innings. The teams each bat After the edges and face have been sanded down, the bat is polished by a bee's wax compound, which helps to keep moisture out and let linseed oil in. The handle is bound by string, and modern additions such as the rubber grip and maker's stickers are applied. Cricket bats are made from a fairly soft and fibrous material called willow or Salix Alba Caerulea.

Cook, increasing heat to medium-high to maintain a simmer if necessary, until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 8-30 minutes, depending on thickness of asparagus. Lift bundles from simmering water with kitchen tongs and drain on paper towels. Fish steamers for either the hob or the microwave are usually a good shape for steaming asparagus as they tend to be oval or rectangular and long enough to accommodate the long spears. We have a fish steamer for the microwave and this is our everyday preferred method of steaming asparagus. 1. Lay the asparagus in a double layer in a wide pan and sprinkle with sea salt. If your pan looks too crowded, steam the asparagus in 2 batches. Pour in just enough water cover the bottom of the pan, but not submerge the bottom layer of asparagus.

Iron deficiency is associated with reversible abnormalities of immune function, but it is difficult to demonstrate the severity and relevance of these in observational studies. Iron treatment has been associated with acute exacerbations of infection, in particular, malaria. Iron and the immune system. Ward RJ(1), Crichton RR, Taylor DL, Della Corte L, Srai SK, Dexter DT. Author information: (1)Biologie du Comportement, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1348, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. roberta.ward@uclouvain.be In vitro studies of iron deficiency and functional immunity. Two component systems of active immunity—humoral and cell-mediated immunity—have been studied extensively, mainly in vitro, in relation to iron deficiency in both humans and animals. Iron is a mineral that plays an important role in immune function. A diet containing too little iron can contribute to anemia and weaken the immune system (1, 2, 3, 4). That's why it's important to optimize your intake of iron-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, legumes, nuts, seeds, cruciferous vegetables and dried fruit. In addition, lymphocytes play an important role in adaptive immunity. Thirdly, a variety of effector molecules, e.g. toll-like receptors, NF-κB, hypoxia factor-1, haem oxygenase, will orchestrate the inflammatory response by mobilising a variety of cytokines, neurotrophic factors, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Iron and immunity are closely linked: firstly by the fact that many of the genes/proteins involved in iron homoeostasis play a vital role in controlling iron fluxes such that bacteria are prevented from utilising iron for growth; secondly, cells of the innate immune system, monocytes, macrophages, microglia and lymphocytes, are able to combat bacterial insults by carefully controlling their iron fluxes, which are mediated by hepcidin and ferroportin. To summarize in vitro evidence, iron deficiency depresses certain aspects of cell-mediated immunity, including lymphocyte, neutrophil and macrophage function; humoral immunity is unaffected and the significance of hypoferremia (as opposed to normal transferrin saturation) on growth of microorganisms is uncertain. Little evidence exists for systematic major humoral deficiencies in iron-deficient humans, and although specific defects in cell-mediated immunity have been well described and reviewed, even in latent iron deficiency, note that such minor functional changes cannot be compared with the devastating effects of the well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes (Dhur et al. 1989, Farthing 1989, Hershko 1993, Oppenheimer and Hendrickse 1983, Scrimshaw and San Giovanni 1997). Combining iron-rich foods with a source of vitamin C can help boost your absorption even further. That said, it's important to remember that overly high blood iron levels can be harmful and may actually suppress the immune system (5, 6, 7) Therefore, it's best to use iron supplements only if you have an iron deficiency, or on the advice of a doctor.

Much will depend on whether the default winds up reported to a database that tracks default on federal debt. Getting a VA loan after a foreclosure is possible. Despite their $0 down payment benefit, VA loans have been the most foreclosure-resistant mortgage product for most of the last eight years. Still, some veterans and military members do default on their hard-earned VA home loans. But military borrowers still have a shot at becoming homeowners after a VA home loan foreclosure. Understanding credit and VA loan entitlement are key parts of bouncing back. After Defaulting on a VA Loan. The reality is it’s possible to get another VA loan after experiencing a foreclosure, a short sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. You’ll typically need to wait two years in order to pursue a new mortgage. Some lenders, including Veterans United, don’t have a waiting period following a short sale in most cases Banks' policies vary, and your lender may require a waiting period of more than two years before financing your new VA loan. If you financed your foreclosed home using a VA loan, you must also repay any losses the government sustained during the foreclosure process before the VA will back your new mortgage. Lenders may have their own in-house requirements on top of that. With a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the seasoning clock begins when the action is discharged. From that point, you’re typically looking at a four-year wait for conventional loans and a two-year wait for either FHA or VA financing. (The FHA’s short-term “Back to Work” program offers qualified borrowers the possibility of even swifter movement after both bankruptcy and foreclosure.) Chapter 13 bankruptcies can be a little different. Additional Concerns. Foreclosure is one of the most damaging entries that can appear on your credit report. As a result, you have no guarantee that your credit will recover enough to borrow again after two years. Lender requirements vary, but you must have a credit score of 620 to 680 before you qualify for a VA loan. Your credit must also reflect no late payments over the last 12 months. If you still have credit problems, your waiting period continues until you clear up your credit history enough to meet the VA's requirements. Your credit score is shot and it can be impossible to get credit. Some homeowners, no doubt, believe that the credit score hit is worth getting out from a deeply underwater mortgage. They may owe, say, $500,000 when their house value is only valued at $350,000. And, they figure, there's no way it will ever be worth what they owe so it's better to get out from underneath the burden. A: There is no wait to buy a property per se, as you can always pay with cash. However, if you need financing, the answer is it depends. If you walked away from your last home it could take as long as seven years for you to again be eligible for a new mortgage from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, but recent changes after the housing market meltdown may shorten that time considerably. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac guidelines A foreclosure can knock anywhere from 85 to 160 points from your credit score. VA lenders will also typically require a two-year seasoning period following a foreclosure. Homeowners who lose an FHA loan to foreclosure may need to wait three years before securing a VA home loan. Many veterans are under the impression that having a VA loan foreclosed on means they’ve automatically lost access to their benefits. If you have gone through a foreclosure, you can get a new FHA mortgage loan after waiting three years. After a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the waiting period is generally two years. If you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you might be able to get a new FHA mortgage before you complete the plan. In order for a VA borrower to have full entitlement restored after foreclosure, he or she must repay the loss (the guarantied amount) suffered by the VA as a result of the foreclosure before being considered for another VA mortgage.

Ever since Microsoft released the developer preview of Windows Phone 8.1, we’ve been stressing her out with our stupid questions, in a hope that Cortana slips up sometime. But according to Larry Heck, a researcher who contributed to the artificial intelligence underpinning Cortana, first impressions will quickly become outdated. Teach me: Microsoft says that its virtual assistant app, Cortana, will quickly get smarter thanks to analysis of data generated as people interact with it. That’s because Microsoft has designed Cortana to get significantly smarter as people use it. Heck claims that Microsoft’s commitment to that approach will allow its virtual assistant, currently described as a beta product, to come closer than competitors like Siri or Google Now to delivering the experience of interacting with a real person.

In response to the attacks on September 11, 2001, the US government created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop policies to help secure nationwide transportation systems, including airports, highways, railroads, buses, and mass transit systems. If you do get approved for TSA Pre-Check, you can choose to receive your Known Traveler Number (KTN) either through the mail or online. When booking flights from airports that support Pre-Check, be sure to do so with an airline that TSA Pre-Check covers, and be sure to enter in your KTN. Your TSA Pre-Check eligibility is valid for 5 years, after which you will have to re-apply. Implementing a key component of the TSA’s intelligence-driven, risk-based approach to security, TSA PreCheck enhances aviation security by placing more focus on pre-screening individuals who volunteer to participate to expedite the travel experience. No, not all airports have a TSA PreCheck lane, and those that do might not have TSA PreCheck at every checkpoint. Learn more about participating Southwest Airlines airports or for more information on checkpoint locations and hours of operation, visit tsa.gov. After verifying whether or not your departure airport has an open TSA PreCheck lane at your security checkpoint, look for signs with the TSA PreCheck logo at the entrance to the checkpoint lanes. While it was initially provided at only 4 airports, the TSA Pre-Check program is now available in over 160 US airports. 1  While it was formerly available only for domestic flights within the United States, TSA Pre-Check has expanded its reach to include certain international flights departing from US airports. Eligibility for TSA Pre-Check. If you are a US citizen and active elite member of any of the partner airlines' Frequent Flyer Programs, you may be invited to opt-in for TSA Pre-Check.

TSA pre check must be renewed every 5 years. I have a credit card that pays for TSA precheck, so my cost was zero. But I would have paid because it is a game changer. While domestically I have been automatically put in TSA pre-check when traveling solo, and that was nice, I don't see the advantage for everyone.

Nutritional Value of Chlorophyll. It is a pigment found in plants, which is packed with a range of powerful nutrients. It is a good source of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K and beta-carotene. Chloroplasts take the energy from the sunlight and use it to make plant food. The food can be used immediately to give cells energy or it can be stored as sugar or starch. If stored, it can be used later when the plant needs to do work, like grow a new branch or make a flower.

If the power will be out longer, place dry or block ice in the refrigerator to keep it as cold as possible. After Power Outage. NEVER taste a food to determine its safety. That will keep the cold in better. A chest freezer will keep cold in better than an upright. When you open an upright, it loses cold air due to gravity. (heat rises, cold descends). A chest keeps most of that cold air in it. And if you open a freezer a lot when the power is out, it will thaw faster. I would guess about 2 days is safe, but as long as the food is frozen, I would continue to trust it. When it starts getting a little soft, then you better either plan to eat a lot, or throw it out, or get a generator. This helps the food stay cold longer.

Discard any perishable food (such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, or leftovers) that has been at temperatures above 40° F for 2 hours or more (or 1 hour if temperatures are above 90º F). Prepare Yourself Before Power Emergencies. 1  Make sure you have appliance thermometers in your refrigerator and freezer. 2  Freeze containers of water for ice to help keep food cold in the freezer, refrigerator, or coolers in case the power goes out.

In another study, researchers found that humans don't really develop the ability to handle multiple pieces of information at once until about the ages of 16 or 17. The brain of an 18-year-old college freshman is still far from resembling the brain of someone in their mid-twenties, said Craig Bennett, a graduate student who was involved in the new research. A group of 17 older students, ranging in age from 25 to 35, served as a control group for comparison. The results showed that the freshmen students' brains underwent significant changes and were very different from that of the older adults. The changes were localized to the cingulate, caudate and insula regions of the brain.

Some scientists say this could illuminate a potential factor behind a recent spate of acts of mass violence, almost all of which have been perpetrated by men between the ages of 20 and 30. At what age is your brain fully developed? Brain Development. Humans are not born with fully developed brains. As we age, our brains are constantly adapting and growing based on our experiences by generating new neural pathways and synapses. However, there is an age at which most people's brains are fully developed. Answer and Explanation: Until the age around 25 your brain is not fully developed.

Wage is a payment which is paid by employer to the employee for what he was employed on regular or weekly or daily basis depending on the hours worked by the employee. Those hours are multiplied by the fix rate and paid to the employee. Topics: Economics and Personal Finances, Socioeconomic Class. 1  Richard Fry is a senior researcher focusing on economics and education at Pew Research Center. 2  Rakesh Kochhar is an associate director of research at Pew Research Center. There is no federal minimum wage for a Class B driver, other than minimum-wage standards that apply to all jobs. However, depending on geographic location and experience as a professional driver, Class B drivers can generally expect to earn more than minimum wage. Average Wages The median annual wage for heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers was $38,200 in 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. If, under the employment agreement, a salary sufficient to meet the minimum wage requirement in every workweek is paid as straight time for whatever number of hours are worked in a workweek, the regular rate is obtained by dividing the salary by the number of hours worked each week. In no case may the regular rate be less than the minimum wage required by the FLSA. If a salary is paid on other than a weekly basis, the weekly pay must be determined in order to compute the regular rate and overtime pay. If the salary is for a half month, it must be multiplied by 24 and the product divided by 52 weeks to get the weekly equivalent. A wage is monetary compensation (or remuneration, personnel expenses, labor) paid by an employer to an employee in exchange for work done. Payment may be calculated as a fixed amount for each task completed (a task wage or piece rate), or at an hourly or daily rate (wage labour), or based on an easily measured quantity of work done. Wages are part of the expenses that are involved in running a business.

Key Differences Between Salary and Wages. Following are the major differences between salary and wages: Salary is the fixed amount of compensation which is paid for the performance of an employee. Wage is the variable amount of compensation which is paid on the basis of hours spent in finishing a certain amount of work. Because the paycheck needs to be computed based on the actual hours worked, the employee earning wages will likely receive her or his paycheck five days after the work period. Salary is best associated with employee compensation quoted on an annual basis. For example, the manager of the assembly plan might earn a salary of $120,000 per year. If the salaried manager is paid semi-monthly (perhaps on the 15th and last day of each month), her or his paycheck will show gross salary of $5,000 for the half-month. roll tax base is wages earned by individuals working in the United States. 1 The wage bases for those taxes are not the same. Some wage income that is subject to payroll taxes is exempt from income tax. Some wage income that is subject to income tax is exempt from payroll taxes.

Half way through Uranus’ orbit (every 42 years), the angle between Uranus and Earth lines up in such a way so as to allow us to see Uranus’ rings edge-on from Earth. Figure 1: This infrared image of the dark side of the rings was taken by the Keck Observatory in 2007. Uranus rotates once every 17 hours 14 minutes and 24 seconds = 62 064 seconds = one Uranus day. One year on Earth is 365.25 days = 31 557 600 seconds. One Earth Year/(One Uran … us day)=508.5 It takes 508.5 Uranus days for the Earth to go around the Sun once.

During parts of its orbit one or other the poles directly face sun which means planet gets uranus&#8212that is almost twenty times as long it takes sunlight to reach earth!. An orbit by Uranus takes 30,800 Earth days (84.3 Earth years, each having 365.25 Earth days). However, a day on Uranus is only 17.24 hours long, so a Uranus year consists of 42,877 Uranian days. *Conflicting figures will result from application of non-Julian years for Earth, or the synodic period of Uranus's orbit, which is 369.66 Earth days. The name Uranus was finally agreed on by everybody in the mid 1800’s. How long are its years and days? Since Uranus is so far away from the Sun, it takes it a very long to to go around the Sun once. A year on Uranus, the amount of time it takes for this trip, is 84 Earth years. A day on Uranus, which is the amount of time it takes for the plant to spin around, or rotate once, is shorter than one day on Earth. The blue-green planet spins around once in a little over seventeen hours. A day on 16 mar 2015 titania, an airless moon of uranus, is cold and its 84 years long. Interestingly the length of a day on mercury is 58 days and 15 hours in earth time. System, one would expect that a day on jupiter last long time. A planet's day is the time it takes the planet to rotate or spin once on its axis. Uranus rotates faster than Earth so a day on Uranus is shorter than a day on Earth. A day on Uranus is 17.24 Earth hours while a day on Earth is 23.934 hours. However, Uranus spins backwards compared to Earth and most of the other planets. Remember that Uranus’ ‘year’ is 84 years long - imagine having 42 years of your life spent in sunlight, and the other half in the dark! The sideways tilt of Uranus also creates interesting weather and cloud patterns that astronomers are interested in studying.

A shirt worn for only an hour or two may not need to be washed and dried at all. If the shirt can go without being washed every time it’s worn, it may last even longer. 7 comments: 1  ElleCMay 14, 2012 at 9:31 PM. Great post. 2  BundanaMay 15, 2012 at 5:56 AM.

On average, pregnancies lasted 38 weeks from the day of conception to the day the baby was born, or about 40 to 41 weeks from the day of the women's last menstrual period. (The latter measure is more commonly used to determine a woman's due date.) Your doctor will ask for your medical history which includes: 1  Medical problems. 2  The date of your last menstrual period. 3  Birth control methods. 4  History of abortions and/or miscarriages. 5  Hospitalizations. 6  Medications you are taking and medication allergies. 7  Your family’s medical history. 12 Weeks Pregnant.

Long Nursing Shifts Linked to Job Dissatisfaction Greater burnout could lead to mistakes, poor care, researchers caution Please note: This article was published more than one year ago. While shifts vary according to a healthcare facility or hospital, the typical night shift is between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Some nurses may start a shift as early as 8:00 p.m. At the end of a night shift, nurses return home where they usually rest and rejuvenate in the early hours of the day. Unfortunately, sleeping throughout the day is sometimes difficult to achieve. In the near term, Dr. Caruso says, shifts between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. can: 1  Result in sleep deprivation and sleepiness. 2  Cause insomnia. 3  Negatively impact clear thinking and instigate memory problems. 4  Affect physical coordination and slow normal reaction time. 5  Depress your immune system response. Despite literature saying the majority of nurses like 12-hour shifts, their research found they were more likely to leave their job than those who worked shorter shifts. Nurses underestimate the impact of working long shifts because the idea of working 3 days a week instead of 5 seems appealing, Stimpfel and colleagues wrote. Researchers found a relationship between shift length and patient satisfaction. When nurses worked shorter shifts, patients were more satisfied.

Additional tips on how to survive the drive home after working the night shift include: 1  Carpool with another nurse when possible, and hold a conversation with the driver. 2  When applicable, choose public transportation. 3  Do not stop for drinks with co-workers as a way to unwind. Hospital nurses often work shifts of 12 hours or longer, either by choice or because of pressure from their managers. But what effect do such long hours have on job satisfaction, and equally important, on the quality of patient care? At the hospital I work at, we do either 8 or 12 hour shifts. Sometimes we come in for 4 hours, and end up staying for longer. It varies among hospitals. The longest I have worked was 18 hours, and that was very unsafe because by hour 15 I was exhausted and more liable to make a mistake. Each state has its rules about nursing hours and requirements. 84.1% of ICU nurses work 12+ hour shifts. 74.3% of black nurses worked 12+ hour shifts, compared to 64.2% of white nurses. 78.4% of male nurses worked 12+ hr shifts, compared to 69.4% of female nurses. 71.4% of nurses with a bachelor's education or higher worked 12+ hour shifts.

Sudden Cardiac Arrest is a leading cause of death in the U.S. It affects more than 356,000 adults (356,461 EMS-assessed individuals) outside hospitals each year. Does Sudden Cardiac Arrest mostly affect the elderly? No. While the average Sudden Cardiac Arrest victim is 60-years-old, SCA affects people of all ages—even children and teens. For People Who Have No Known Risk Factors for Sudden Cardiac Arrest CHD seems to be the cause of most SCAs in adults. CHD also is a major risk factor for angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart attack, and it contributes to other heart problems. Some people choose to avoid aggressive measures at the end of life. A do not resuscitate order (DNR) in the form of an advance health care directive makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest, the person does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cardiac arrest involves the cessation of the heart muscle pumping blood through the body. If the body doesn't pump blood through the body, the other organs are deprived of oxygen including the brain resulting in irreversible brain injury.

But, more recently, we kinda thought that maybe it would be best to take a canoe. This winter, my brothers really wanted to go, and that pushed us to make it happen this summer. There are seven National Park Service sites along the Mississippi River. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself. The mile marks go upriver so mile zero is at the lower end of the upper Mississippi River at Cairo, IL. In all there are 29 locks to pass through on the upper Mississippi River. The Mississippi River may be the most musical river in the entire world! Drum songs, folk songs, blues and jazz were all created and recreated along its banks. In Life on the Mississippi, he wrote of having seen monstrous-sized catfish six feet long, weighing 250 pounds.. Even today, traditions and myths survive among river people of giant fishes and other river creatures of fabulous size. The lower Mississippi is very different from the upper river. The upper river has many islands, back channels, and back water areas. Crossing are often 5 miles wide. In contrast, the lower Mississippi runs in a single narrow deep channel at a relatively fast rate of flow. The Mississippi is one of the world’s great rivers. It spans 3,860 miles (6,210 km) of length as measured using its northernmost west fork, the Missouri River, which starts in the Rocky Mountains in Montana, joining the Mississippi proper in the state of Missouri. My folks at age 22 canoed down the Mississippi in 1940 in my dad’s homemade yellow canoe. People in the river towns took them in at night and fed them. They went all the way down to St. Louis. I believe they started in northern Illinois somewhere. Query: how long does the mississippi river go",

            "input": "Calcium is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Ca. Its atomic number is 20. It has 20 protons and 20 electrons. The most common isotopes are Ca-40 and Ca-44. Its mass number is about 40.08. Calcium is very important in the human body, for making bones and for other purposes. As you state in the question, glucose enters the beta-cell and is metabolized creating an INCREASE in the ATP content of the cell. This increased ATP binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channels and CLOSES them. Inactivation and closure is an intrinsic property of that type of calcium channel, and the channels do not REACTIVATE until the cell returns to being polarized once again. This inactivation is what limits the amount of calcium flux INTO the cell, which as mentioned in the other answer can be toxic to the cell. Calcium is not found as a metal in the ground; it is too reactive. Calcium carbonate, also known as calcite, is the most common calcium mineral. Calcium in cells. It is important to know how cells work. Many cells have calcium channels on their surface. These are openings where calcium ions can enter the cell. The cell is told to act and it opens the channels. Once in the cell calcium ions activates many proteins to do specific things. When the cell reaches a threshold potential (that is, when it becomes depolarized to a certain point), it will cause opening of a type of voltage sensitive calcium channels. At this point, calcium channels open and allow calcium to flow down its concentration gradient and INTO the beta-cells. This calcium entry is required for the release of insulin vesicles through a mechanism that is outside the scope of this question, but unrelated to the calcium channels opening and closing. Remember, these channels are typically OPEN and allow potassium to normally flow OUT of the cell (because that would be potassium flowing DOWN its concentration gradient... potassium concentration is higher inside the cell than outside the cell). Note: This is the opposite for calcium, which would flow INTO the cell and down its concentration gradient (calcium outside the cell is higher than calcium inside the cell). At the same time the ATP-sensitive channels are acting, there are Na/K ATPase pumps at work to move sodium OUT of the cell and potassium INTO to the cell (against the concentration gradients of both those ions). How does excitation-contraction coupling in a cardiac muscle cell differ from that in a skeletal and smooth muscle fiber. Cardiac--depolarization due to influx of calcium ions through voltage gated channels (L type calcium channels which are modified versions of the DHP receptors in skeletal muscle). Cardiac--instead of being open directly by voltage as in skeletal muscle, cardiac are opened by binding of trigger calcium in cytosol. Mechanism by which individual muscle cells of the heart function as if they were a single unit, all undergoing synchronous electrical and mechanical activity. Cardiac muscles are joined by gap junctions that permit the conduction of action potential from cell to cell. This means that potassium can't leave the cell anymore, which depolarises the membrane and causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open and release calcium into the cell to trigger insulin release. I don't understand why this happens, because both potassium and calcium being positively charged. When it is in a chunk, it starts reacting slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on the calcium. If a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide, it dissolves it, making the calcium react very fast. It burns when powdered to make a reddish flame. This makes calcium oxide.

The Earth completes a rotation around the sun, known as an orbit, in 365.24 days. Earth is located an average of 92.96 million miles from the sun, varying between the closest distance of 91.40 million miles and the furthest distance of 94.51 million miles. Discussion Questions These questions can be used for group discussion or for written answers in the students’ learning logs. 1. How many days does it take for the Earth to make one revolution of the Sun? Answer: The Earth takes 365 ¼ days to revolve around the Sun. This is known as one Earth year. Each planet takes a different amount of time to rotate around the Sun. 2. How many times will the Earth rotate as it goes around the sun once? Answer: The Earth rotates 365 ¼ times as it revolves around the Sun. This is also the number of days in one Earth year. 3. If it takes 365 ¼ days for the Earth to go around the Sun, but each year only has 365 days, what happens to the ¼ day? Answer: Leap Year occurs every 4 years. This is because each 4 times around the Sun, there is a total of one extra day. (¼ + ¼ + ¼ + ¼ = 1) This day is added on February 29th every fourth year, making that year 366 days long. 4. How many times does the Moon orbit the Earth in one Earth year? Answer: About 12, or 12.3 times. This is why we have about twelve full moons each year. 5. Does the Moon give off its own light? How do you know? Answer: No, in this model, the Moon is represented by a Styrofoam ball and does not give off light. 6. Each planet in the solar system has its own unique rotation rate. Tiny Mercury, sizzling closest to the Sun, takes 59 Earth days to turn around just once. Venus, the second planet, rotates once every 243 Earth days. What's more, Venus rotates backwards from the direction of its orbit around the Sun, as do Uranus and tiny dwarf planet Pluto. Uranus even lies down on the job, rolling around with its axis of rotation pointed nearly toward the Sun. Why do Earth and the other planets rotate at all? Scientists estimate that a day in the life of early Earth was only about 6 hours long. The Moon formed much closer to Earth than it is today. As Earth rotates, the Moon's gravity causes the oceans to seem to rise and fall. (The Sun also does this, but not as much.) There is a little bit of friction between the tides and the turning Earth, causing the rotation to slow down just a little. As Earth slows, it lets the Moon creep away. Earth's rotation, he added, is also affected by the tidal pull of the moon. Because of the moon, the spin of the Earth is slowing down at a rate of about 1 millisecond per year. The Earth spun around at a faster clip in the past, enough so that during the time of the dinosaurs a day was about 22 hours long. In addition to slowing the Earth's rotation, the moon's tidal pull is causing the moon to slowly recede from the Earth, at a rate of about 1 millimeter per year. The Earth completes a rotation around the sun, known as an orbit, in 365.24 days. Earth is located an average of 92.96 million miles from the sun, varying between the closest distance of 91.40... The Earth completes a rotation around the sun, known as an orbit, in 365.24 days. The total circumference of Earth's orbit is a little over 584 million miles. Although an Earth day is equal to 24 hours, the planet actually completes a rotation around its axis, which is known as a sidereal orbit period, once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds.

Urine testing is the most common method for detecting marijuana / cannabis consumption. It can be detected up to 5 days after consumption in infrequent users while it can be detected up to 15 days after consumption in heavy users or those with a high percentage of body fat. On a Urine Drug Test, THC will appear as a positive within 2-5 hours of use.

Of course, the only way to have a pot-free system is not to smoke or ingest marijuana in the first place. If your urine comes off as too dilute, and you get a second chance to take the test, schedule it as far out as possible. This will give you time to either reach the end of your detectable period or to try the dilution method again, making adjustments so that you don’t over-dilute. When the concentration of marijuana in urine exceeds 50 ng/mL, most THC drug tests yield a positive result. Blood testing. In blood samples, cannabis can be detected for about 12 to 24 hours after consumption, with regards to infrequent users. The drug can be found in blood samples of frequent users for up to 7 days. Blood tests are not so common but are usually done in investigations of accidents and injuries. How long does weed stay in your system? The total amount of time that weed stays in your system depends on the conditions of the user and how frequently they smoke marijuana.

The Qin dynasty was brief in duration (221-206 BCE) but very important in Chinese history. It followed the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) and it ended when Liu Bang became the king of Han in 206 BCE (the formal beginning of the Han dynasty). Despite its brevity, the Qin dynasty left important marks on Chinese culture. The imperial era was 221 BC – 1912 AD, from China's unification under Qin rule till the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China era from 1912, and the modern China era from 1949. Timeline of Chinese History The short-lived Qin Dynasty was the first to unite China as a country under an emperor instead of a ruling clan. A bureaucratic government was introduced, and was continued by the less-extreme Han Dynasty. The Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC) was the first and shortest imperial dynasty in China, famous for great building projects like the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army. Liu Bang, a peasant leader, overthrew the unpopular Qin regime and established the Han Dynasty.

In general, professional and volunteer experiences are best completed while earning the bachelor’s degree. Waiting until after graduation could extend the amount of time it takes to become a veterinarian. Veterinary Doctorate. Professional veterinary programs are usually 4 years long. They are typically bisected into dual 2-year segments, focusing on classroom instruction and clinical practice, in that order. Veterinary school is extremely competitive. Because animals can get sick at anytime, vets often work long hours. Those in group practices may take turns working weekends or evenings and dealing with emergencies. Many vets like their work because they can be with animals every day. Prospective veterinarians must complete a doctor of veterinary medicine degree. Typically, a doctorate in veterinary medicine takes four years to complete. Of these four years, three are spent on classroom training where students take courses in animal anatomy and physiology. They also take courses on disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Veterinary programs may also include management and career development courses. Query: how long to be the vet",

Most studies use a high-dose loading strategy, which can rapidly elevate your muscle creatine content. Although this is not necessary, it will help you reap the benefits of creatine after just a few days . To load with creatine, take four 5-gram servings throughout the day for about 5-7 days. After that, take 3-5 grams per day to maintain your muscle creatine stores . The key point to take away from this article is that creatine supplementation can certainly enhance performance output, especially anaerobically, and it does this through a variety of mechanisms (one of which appears to be by enhancing recovery during intermittent, high-intensity exercise). Creatine works. Weight lifters know this, professors know this, the marketers who sell the stuff know this. But nobody should put anything in their body without weighing the benefits and risks first.

Several national and international agencies study different substances in the environment to determine if they can cause cancer. However, this is not always the case. The signature mutation caused by ultraviolet light is a CC to TT mutation, caused when a CC dimer is mispaired with two adenine bases during replication. Because of these mutations, the connection between ultraviolet damage to DNA and cancer is quite clear. Whenever we walk in the sun, ultraviolet light (UV) attacks our DNA, making chemical changes that corrupt our genetic information. Fortunately, the most dangerous UV light never reaches us at all: the ozone in the upper atmosphere absorbs (at least for now) the energetic UVC wavelengths. The longer UV wavelengths, however, do pass through the atmosphere and fall on us. Yes. In fact, most skin cancers are a direct result of exposure to the UV rays in sunlight. Both basal cell and squamous cell cancers (the most common types of skin cancer) tend to be found on sun-exposed parts of the body, and their occurrence is typically related to lifetime sun exposure.

They must develop through the remaining instars (approximately 5 days) and the chrysalis stage (at least 10 days). 30 years. There is a long and growing list of abundant species that are undergoing precipitous declines, including many species of mollusks, pollinators, amphibians, bats, songbirds and fishes. Faulty assumptions about the resiliency of once-common species can lead to lack of timely intervention, The viceroy is a North American butterfly that ranges through most of the contiguous United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. The westernmost portion of its range extends from the Northwest Territories along the eastern edges of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada mountains, southwards into central Mexico. Its easternmost range extends along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America from Nova Scotia into Texas. It was long been thought to be a Batesian mimic of the monarch butter How can you tell a monarch from a Viceroy?

The monarch (Danaus plexippus) is a brushfooted butterfly of the Danainae subfamily. It is perhaps the most well-known of all North American butterflies. Since the 19th century, it is also found in New Zealand, and has been known in Australia since 1871. [1] [2] In Australia it is also known as the wanderer butterfly. [3] In Europe it is resident in the Canary Islands and Madeira, and is found as a migrant in Russia, Azores, Sweden and Spain. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 8.5–12.5 cm (3.34 in–4.92in).

            "input": "Hey, here’s a question: does the Moon orbit the Sun? Of course not, it’s a silly question. Of course the Moon orbits the Earth. How long does the Earth take to travel around the Sun? Obviously, the answer is one year or 365.25 days. It is not so simple though as there are a number of definitions of a year. For example, Tropical year, which is from equinox to equinox, that is from the time the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north to the next time 365.24219 days Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1 km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30 km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit. Best Answer: Like all planets in our solar system, the Earth is in an elliptical orbit around our Sun. In Earth's case, its orbit is nearly circular, so that the difference between Earth's farthest point from the Sun and its closest point is very small. Earth's orbit defines a two-dimensional plane which we call the ecliptic. It takes roughly 365 days for the Earth to go around the Sun once. This means that the Earth is rushing through space around the Sun at a rate of about 67,000 miles per hour! The time it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun one full time is what we call a year. The combined effect of the Earth's orbital motion and the tilt of its rotation axis result in the seasons. With an average orbital speed of 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. In other words, a year on Saturn lasts about as long as 29.5 years here on Earth. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. How long does the moon take to orbit around the sun once? The Earth's Moon orbits around Earth once in a Month and the Earth orbits around the Sun once in a year, so the Moon orbits around the Sun once in a year too. Edit Share to: So in 90 seconds, for example, we all move some 12,500 miles (20,000 km) in orbit around the galaxy’s center. Our Milky Way galaxy is a big place. Even at this blazing speed, it takes the sun approximately 225-250 million years to complete one journey around the galaxy’s center. One year. That is actually the basis and definition of a year; the time for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. However the length of a year was known long before we knew that Earth orbits the Sun and not the other way around. That is because as Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun can be seen moving against the background of stars in Earth's sky, and the time it takes the apparent Sun to go once around the starry sky is the same as the time for Earth to go around the Sun. 2016-01-12T23:41:03-05:00. 1  The obvious answer to this question would be a year or 365 days, but the Universe is much more complicated than that. 2  Earth's orbit of 584 million miles around the sun is made in 365.256 days at a speed of 67000 mph. Every planet in the Solar System takes a certain amount of time to complete a single orbit around the Sun. Here on Earth, this period lasts 365.25 days – a period that we refer to as a year. When it comes to the other planets, we use this measurement to characterize their orbital periods. Query: how long dose it take for the earth to orbit around the sun?",

Depending on what you're using it for, a useful business plan can be any length, from a scrawl on the back of an envelope to, in the case of an especially detailed plan describing a complex enterprise, more than 100 pages. A typical business plan runs 15 to 20 pages, but there's room for wide variation from that norm. If you’ve reviewed what a business plan is, and why you need one to start and grow your business, then it’s time to dig into the process of actually writing a business plan. In this step-by-step guide, I’ll take you through every stage of writing a business plan that will actually help you achieve your goals. Main points should show up in a business plan as quickly as they do in a business pitch or presentation. Unfortunately, many people still use page count as measurement. And in that context, some of the more practical, internal-use-only business plans can be only 5 or 10 pages long. Corporate business plans for large companies can run into hundreds of pages. The first is the assumption that making a business continuity plan is enough, that it doesn’t have to be tested. The second is a shortage of staff available to run the tests. However if at least the necessity to test is recognised, even if resources are scarce, you can still make some amends. Ideally, your business plan should be 15-25 pages long and it should include an executive summary of between 2-4 pages, depending on the complexity of the business and the purpose of the plan, which answers the two questions asked by every experienced investor:: Here goes the quick guidelines to keep the business plan simple: 1  Avoid long complicated sentences. 2  Avoid buzzwords, jargon and acronyms; you know that KISS stands for “keep it simple, stupid,” but don’t assume anybody else does. 3  Avoid verbose text. 4  Keep the text style same throughout the business plan. For the business plan document we use to back up an effort to attract outside investors, or in an MBA contest setting, or to back up a commercial loan application, 10-15 pages of easy-to-read text plus as many charts and tables as you want.

We can go for about six hours in this glucose-burning mode, which is why we tend to get a bit cranky if we have to go without food for longer than that. The point is that not all of your cells die quickly without oxygen. In surgeries they cut off blood supplies for up to hours and tissues don't die. Your brain is really what needs the oxygen. It has a huge metabolic requirement, and it needs a constant supply of oxygen for cellular respiration. In essence, your body is buying you some valuable time to give you a fair chance of finding some food. 0-6 hours after eating.

When a limb falls asleep, it is getting the nerve pinched off for a time as well as loosing some blood flow. However, this is not a complete loss and so your arm is able to survive because it is still receiving enough oxygen and other nutrients to sustain its existence (as well as having toxins and CO2 pumped away from it). The human body can go without oxygen for about five to ten minutes, and about three to eight days without water. But remarkably, people have been known to live upwards of 70 days without food. How is this possible? The crucian carp can live in anoxic water for months at temperatures close to freezing. Similarly the turtle, Trachemys scripta, can withstand anoxia for 48 h at 20 °C and at least 3 months at 3 °C. Most of the book is in fact devoted to a detailed look at the adaptions that allow these species to survive without oxygen for a long time.

            "input": "Fluoride supplements were developed in the 1950s based on the incorrect and outdated notions that (a) fluoride’s benefit to teeth comes from being swallowed during childhood, and that (b) children in unfluoridated communities have a deficiency of fluoride intake. For example, the use of a series of four or more topical applications should be considered for a patient with a severe caries problem. Likewise, a reduced topical application time of 30 seconds as opposed to four minutes may be adequate to maintain a patient with little or no current caries activity. Check with your child's doctor for any other special instructions. 1  Your child can eat and drink right after the fluoride varnish is applied. But only give your child soft foods and cold or warm (not hot) foods or liquids. 2  Do not brush or floss teeth for at least 4 to 6 hours. Fluoride varnish is a highly concentrated form of fluoride which is applied to the tooth's surface, by a dentist, dental hygienist or other health care professional, as a type of topical fluoride therapy.[1] It is not a permanent varnish but due to its adherent nature it is able to stay in contact with the tooth surface for several hours. When is Fluoride Varnish not used? Fluoride varnish is not used if there are noticeable sores in the mouth or on the gums. It is also not used if there is an allergy to one of the ingredients in the varnish or to pine nuts. If you have any questions, talk to your doctor or dentist. The first use of adjusted fluoride in water for caries control began in 1945 and 1946 in the United States and Canada, when the fluoride concentration was adjusted in the drinking water supplying four communities (2--5). Water fluoridation reduces cavities in children, while efficacy in adults is less clear. A Cochrane review estimates a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. The evidence quality was poor. The CDC recommends that in communities where natural fluoride levels are high, parents should give kids water from other sources. The ADA also recognizes that infants need less fluoride than older kids and adults. Some infants may be getting too much fluoride in the water used to reconstitute infant formula. Fluoride supplements can be prescribed for children ages 6 months to 16 years who are at high risk for tooth decay and whose primary drinking water has a low fluoride concentration. 2, 21 Tablets and lozenges are manufactured with 1.0, 0.5, or 0.25 mg fluoride. 2, 3 Most supplements contain sodium fluoride as the active ingredient. 2 To maximize the topical effect of fluoride, tablets and lozenges are intended to be chewed or sucked for 1–2 minutes before being swallowed; 2, 3, 5 for ... A 1992 census found that, for U.S. public water supply systems reporting the type of compound used, 63% of the population received water fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid, 28% with sodium fluorosilicate, and 9% with sodium fluoride.

If a package of materials does not have autoclave tape, it is assumed to be non-sterile, which means that it needs to be processed in the autoclave before it can be used. When materials are packaged for the autoclave, the tape is added last, and most people include a notation of the date on the tape. The tape is designed to adhere in spite of the high heat and steam in the autoclave. With the use of autoclave tape, people can determine whether or not packages of material have passed through the autoclave, and they can also see how recently supplies were sterilized, by referring to the date noted on the tape. Autoclave tape is a specialized tape product which is used on packages of materials placed in an autoclave. The tape has chemical strips sensitive to high heat and pressure which change color when they are exposed to sufficiently high heat and pressure, indicating that a package of materials has been in an autoclave. The following are basic instructions for autoclave use but do not replace the manufacturer's operating instructions and hands-on training. Before using any autoclave for the first time, read and thoroughly understand the owner's manual because many makes and models have unique characteristics.

Steam/Autoclave. Steam sterilization is the oldest and most common process used in medical and related applications. Its proven effectiveness is further enhanced by being both reliable and economical. In this process, the item to be sterilized is placed in a chamber, e.g. an Autoclave. The item is exposed to a combination of heat and saturated steam (water vapor) for an established period of time. This process kills the micro-organisms present, sterilizing the item. Generating Steam and Steam Quality. Steam is the autoclave’s sterilization agent. In our Sterilization Methods series, we explained the physics of steam and why it’s ideal for destroying microorganisms such as bacteria and spores. Part 1 of this post will explain how steam is generated for autoclaving purposes. Autoclave tape. Autoclave tape is an adhesive tape used in autoclaving (heating under high pressure with steam to sterilise) to indicate whether a specific temperature has been reached. Autoclave tape works by changing color after exposure to temperatures commonly used in sterilization processes, typically 121°C in a steam autoclave. Small strips of the tape are applied to the items before they are placed into the autoclave. The tape is similar to masking tape but slightly more adhesive, to allow it to adhere under the hot, moist conditions of the autoclave. One such tape has diagonal markings containing an ink which changes colour (usually beige to black) upon heating. It is important to note that the presence of autoclave tape that has changed color on an item does not ensure that the product is sterile, as the tape ...

The lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom which forms the bond to the iron has a 120 degree angle with respect to the oxygen molecule itself. In chemistry we say it is sp2 hybridized. The heme iron serves as a source or sink of electrons during electron transfer or redox chemistry. In peroxidase reactions, the porphyrin molecule also serves as an electron source. In the transportation or detection of diatomic gases, the gas binds to the heme iron. During the detection of diatomic gases, the binding of the gas ligand to the heme iron induces conformational changes in the surrounding protein. Heme or haem is a coordination complex consisting of an iron ion coordinated to a porphyrin acting as a tetradentate ligand, and to one or two axial ligands. The definition is loose, and many depictions omit the axial ligands. The iron atom of heme is directly bonded to one of the histidines called the proximal histidine of the globin protein at the fifth coordination position. The oxygen binding site is present on the other side of the heme plane, at the sixth coordination position. Assuming that the deprotonated forms of HA and HZ bind selectively to the heme iron, the pH dependence of K D,app can be expressed by the following equation : K D, app =K D ·(1+[H +]/K a), where K D is a pH-independent dissociation constant and K a is the acid dissociation constant. Your question says “how is the heme molecule attached to globin protein”. Let’s first get the idea of what heme is. Heme is a non-protein group, which is the active site for haemoglobin, as well as myoglobin. Heme is held to the peptide portion (globin) of the protein by a combination of forces: 1  The coordination of iron by histidine nitrogen of the protein, 2  Hydrogen bonding, and. 3  Van der Waals forces between hydrophobic parts of the two molecules. Heme - Function. 1  Hemoproteins have diverse biological functions including the transportation of diatomic gases, chemical catalysis, diatomic gas detection, and electron transfer. The following genes are part of the chemical pathway for making heme: 1  ALAD: aminolevulinic acid, δ-, dehydratase (deficiency causes ala-dehydratase deficiency porphyria) 2  ALAS1: aminolevulinate, δ-, synthase 1. 3  ALAS2: aminolevulinate, δ-, synthase 2 (deficiency causes sideroblastic/hypochromic anemia) A2A: Quickly speaking, the heme group contains the famous iron ion that is in hemoglobin, that binds to and carries oxygen. The iron atom has a very strong covalent bond with the globular protein on the proximal histidine of the protein (the F8 histidine residue), on histidine's imidazole ring. Even with this strong covalent bond, the iron still has the ability to bind with oxygen via a dipolar or coordinate covalent bond. That is the electrostatic bond that hemoglobin is involved in, not the one that binds heme to the globin proteins in the first place. So the iron atom is not only involved in keeping the heme group attached to the globin proteins, but it is the functional oxygen-carrying component of the hemoglobin molecule.

IF you want to know the real answer to how many Aircraft Carriers?... you cannot redefine the question to mean something else. We have 10 Carriers. The Japanese Navy had 25 carriers of all types; 1 was laid up damaged, another beached and capsized, 20 were lost to enemy action. The French Navy, as noted above, had 1 carrier, converted to an aircraft transport in 1944. This count is for commissioned naval vessels designated as aircraft carriers only. Nimitz class aircraft carrier design. The more recent Nimitz Class carriers (CVN72-CVN76) have a displacement of 102,000t when fully loaded. They have a length of 317m and beam of 40.8m. The carrier reaches a maximum speed of over 30kt, and accommodates a complement of 3,184 personnel (with 203 officers); 2,800 aircrew (with 366 officers); and 70 flag (with 25 officers). Aircraft Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Wednesday defended his budget’s call to increase military spending by complaining that the U.S. has only 10 aircraft carriers and that the U.S. Army is smaller than it was in 1945 and the U.S. Navy is smaller than it was during World War I. List of aircraft carriers in service. This is a list of aircraft carriers which are currently in service, reserve, under construction, or being rebuilt. An aircraft carrier is a warship with a full-length flight deck, hangar and facilities for arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. The list only refers to the status of the ship, not availability or condition of an air wing. This includes helicopter carriers and amphibious assault ships, which are vessels whose primary purpose is to carry, arm, deploy, and recover aircraft. Statistically, one can take the numbers of carriers in action per month during the period and come up with a composite carrier’s profile of operating numbers: Flights: 2755; action sorties 1043; combat losses: 61; combat operational losses: 26; non-combat related losses: 28; for a total of 115 aircraft lost in a 12 month period. In the United States Navy, these consist of ships commissioned with hull classification symbols CV (aircraft carrier), CVA (attack aircraft carrier), CVB (large aircraft carrier), CVL (light aircraft carrier), CVN (aircraft carrier (nuclear propulsion)) and CVAN (attack aircraft carrier (nuclear propulsion)). There are 11 aircraft carriers currently in service in the U.S. fleet USS Enterprise (CVN-65): 85,600 ton unique nuclear-powered supercarrier, commissioned 25 November 1961.

This absence of sufficient seapower sets the stage for trouble reaching far beyond the region, raising the larger question of how the U.S. is planning future naval forces. Aircraft carriers are an instructive example. In the 2007 Defense Authorization bill, Congress wrote into law that we must not go below eleven. Since December 2012, this has been lowered to ten so that USS Enterprise could be retired before USS Ford’s 2016 commissioning. Query: how many aircraft carriers usa have",

If you are in a tax bracket above 15%, then your long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate that is lower than your ordinary rate. If, however, you sell an investment that you have held for a year or less, the gains are taxed at your regular rate. Best Answer: You only need to hold a stock for  one day to earn the dividend. But in your example you would not get the dividend. You need to buy before the ex-div date to get the dividend. If you buy before ex-div date and sell on or after the ex-div date, you get the dividend. An investor should hold a short sell position for as long as the investment is profitable and as long as the investor can reasonably expect the profits to increase. However, there are a number of additional factors that can influence a short seller's decision on when to close out his investment. Short sellers must have an awareness of the increased risk level involved in selling short as opposed to buying long. An investor buying a stock can only sustain a maximum loss of 100% of his or her investment, but a short seller, while having a maximum potential profit of 100%, faces virtually unlimited risk given that a stock price can theoretically rise to infinitely higher prices. The aim is to hold onto the short until the price of the stock drops, enabling the investor to buy back the borrowed amount of shares at a lower price and realize a profit from the short sell transaction, but interest charges must be figured into net profit. Best Answer: You only need to hold a stock for one day to earn the dividend. But in your example you would not get the dividend. You need to buy before the ex-div date to get the dividend. If you buy before ex-div date and sell on or after the ex-div date, you get the dividend. There are four dates related to dividends. So, if you sell a stock, you will need to pay taxes on the gains. The good news is, that you don’t have to pay taxes on this type of income until you sell and lock in the gains. As you make the decision about whether or not to sell a stock, it can help to consider whether or not your gains are considered long term or short-term. Long-Term Gains versus Short-Term Gains. The amount of time you hold an investment matters when figuring what you owe in terms of taxes. If you hold something for a year or less, it is considered a short-term investment. On the other hand, if you hold a stock for more than a year (one year plus one day), it is considered long-term. Understanding this is vital as you consider taxes, since short-term capital gains are taxed as regular income, and long-term capital gains have their own tax rates. The company pays because of having the money/investment for a time period. If you sell on July 7th you will have nothing to do with that stock and no payment will be made.

Best Answer: Officially, the world's fastest jet-powered aircraft remains the SR-71 Blackbird. Although the official record is about Mach 3.3 (or 3.3 times the speed of sound), many believe the aircraft could actually fly much faster. However, it seems unlikely that the SR-71 could go much faster than about Mach 3.5, with a very slim chance of Mach 4, due to propulsion and structural limitations. Quick Answer. It is not uncommon for many types of modern fighter jets to sustain speeds of one to two times the speed of sound. However, there are a number of jets that are capable of travelling much faster. The world's fastest jet is the X-15, which regularly reached Mach 6.72. Continue Reading Another area of concern for sustained high-speed flight is engine operation. Jet engines create thrust by increasing the temperature of the air they ingest, and as the aircraft speeds up, friction and compression heat this air before it reaches the engines. Duralumin, the traditional aircraft material, starts to lose strength and go into plastic deformation at relatively low temperatures, and is unsuitable for continuous use at speeds above Mach 2.2 to 2.4. Private jets are so much faster that charter flights can cut hours off of your total travel time between the expedited boarding process and flying faster once taking to the air.â The standard 747 travels at approximately 600 mph, which is considerably slower than the Gulfstream G650 which peaks at 704 mph. Mach 1 is approximately equal to 663 mph. Airlines planes go mostly at the speed of mach 0.7. Military planes can go up to the speed of mach 5.

Gel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or sieving medium during electrophoresis, the movement of a charged particle in an electrical field. What are the components of a gel electrophoresis chamber? What kinds of macromolecules can you look at with gel electrophoresis? Do you need to use different techniques for the different kinds of macromolecules? How do you visualize the macromolecules in the gel? What are real-life examples of what gel electrophoresis is used for? Bibliography Once these are separated, a photo is taken of the gel, providing a picture of the separated molecular parts. This process is called electrophoresis and helps us to better understand and identify the molecular components of living things. Forensics In the world of forensics, gel electrophoresis is used to obtain a DNA fingerprint of a criminal. This means that scientists can accurately tell whether two pieces of DNA, one found at a crime scene and one belonging to a suspect, are matches. Gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules and their fragments, based on their size and charge. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge and/or size and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge. Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molec · Gel Electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE Gel Electrophoresis which includes Protein Gel Electrophoresis Current Uses of Gel Electrophoresis -Gel electrophoresis is a technique used for the separation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), or protein molecules by using an electric field and a gel matrix. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually used in order for investigations. DNA profiling is the process of determining an individual's DNA characteristics, called a DNA profile, that is very likely to be different in unrelated individuals, thereby being as unique to individuals as are fingerprints. DNA profiling with the aim of identifying not an individual but a species is called DNA barcoding. DNA profiling is most commonly used as a forensic technique in criminal investigations to identify an unidentified person or whose identity needs to be confirmed, or to place a person at a crime scene or to eliminate a person from consideration. Electrophoresis is used in DNA for fingerprints for forensics, paternity testing, checking PCR reactions, disease detection and to look for evolutionary relationships among organisms. A solution of negatively charged DNA molecules are pulled through gel using an electric field. Thanks to TV shows like CSI, many people are familiar with the use of gel to separate macromolecules like DNA. However, gel electrophoresis91112 can also be used to separate out proteins. Different proteins have different sizes, mainly due to the number of building blocks in their structure. Gel Electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by their sizes and charges. It makes it possible to identify the differences and similarities between different plants and animals. Although there are some different types of Gel Electrophoresis such as Capillary and Agarose, this is how the general technology works: Quick Answer. Electrophoresis, also called gel electrophoresis, is used to separate the macromolecules of DNA, RNA and proteins. DNA and RNA are separated according to their size and length, while proteins are separated according to their charges. Query: how is gel electrophoresis used in the field of forensics",

How to Sell Your Car Privately Three Parts: Preparing to Sell Your Car Increasing the Value of Your Vehicle Selling Your Car Community Q&A Selling your car on your own can be a nerve wracking experience. lt;p>The new-car delivery process at a dealership can be agonizingly slow, since it often includes arranging financing, registering the car and signing sales contracts. New-car buyers on average spent half a work day (4.3 hours) in dealerships in 2011, according to the most recent J.D. Power and Associates U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index. Some of that time can be chalked up to the complexity of new cars and the time it takes a salesperson to explain the audio, entertainment and navigation systems in your new vehicle. Title > Frequently Asked Questions. 1  Transfer ownership to the buyer on the reverse side of the title by filling in buyer's name, buyer's address, and current odometer reading. 2  Obtain signatures of seller and buyer. 3  Give the title to the buyer. They will likely ask you if you are using the car you want to sell as a trade-in for a new car. You may be offered more money on paper if you are using the car as a trade-in than if you want to sell it for cash. Most dealers will work with you whether you are looking to use your car as a trade-in for a new vehicle or not, though. Floor plan financing is a type of short-term loan that is paid off in 30 to 90 days, the time it normally takes to sell a car. A typical new car costs a dealer about $5 to $10 in interest per day. So if a car sits on the lot for 30 days, the dealer will be charged $150 - $300 in interest payments. This is why dealers want to sell cars as quickly as possible - to reduce their financing costs and increase profits. I did much better sitting my car on the side of a busy road with shoe polish on the window and a low price. Autotrader is in the business of selling ads. Unless your car is priced below wholesale, chances are not great you will sell it within 2 weeks. Possible, but not great. Take it by multiple car dealers that sell cars like yours and get offers. Then price your car at a little above that. Selling a car online is a different beast than selling it through the newspaper classifieds. Most classified sales are local, allowing the buyer to personally eyeball the vehicle, test drive it and even take it to a mechanic for an inspection. Many by-owner, online used-car sales are long-distance transactions that are finalized without the buyer seeing or test driving the car.

The family is important in providing support and caring for the patient and it is important to provide support in terms of home help, respite care, counselling on a continuing basis. Lung cancer can affect breathing by interfering with the normal function of the lung by one of three processes. The first is when a tumor blocks off an airway and essentially takes that piece of lung out of commission.. Studies document that spouses are as distressed as cancer patients and that spousal and patient distress are correlated. Three major areas of caregiver concern are: fear of cancer and its spread, helping patients deal with the emotional ramifications of the disease, and managing the disruptions caused by cancer. From 20% to 30% of partners suffer from psychological impairment and mood disturbance as a result of the spouse's cancer. Below are facts and statistics on lung cancer, looking at trends in mortality, prevalence, gender and racial differences, survival rate and burden (i.e., impact of disease). To understand how lung cancer starts, different types, how it affects your body and other lung cancer basics, visit our Learn About Lung Cancer section. Lung cancer is the most common cancer all around the world. According to the American Lung Association, there were 1.8 million new cases in 2012, as well as 1.6 million deaths from lung cancer. The most common type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80 to 85 percent of all cases, according to the Lung Cancer Alliance. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 15 to 20 percent of lung cancers. At the time of diagnosis, two out of three people with SCLC are already in the extensive stage. Anyone can get lung cancer, but smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke is linked to about 90 percent of lung cancer cases. Other cause-and-effect relationships have been noted in workers between 1  –. benzene and leukemia; 2  asbestos and lung cancer; and. 3  vinyl chloride and liver cancer. The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation is the UK's only lung cancer charity. It can provide information on lung cancer and its treatment, and has free factsheets and leaflets on topics such as breathlessness. It also runs a number of local support groups. Phone the Foundation’s free helpline on 0333 323 7200 or visit the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation website. They can also help people with lung cancer to control their pain and symptoms, although they don't provide hands-on nursing care. There are almost 4,000 Macmillan nurses, most of them employed by the NHS. They work in hospitals or visit patients' homes, with some Macmillan nurses working in hospices. The American Cancer Society recommends the following 1  –. Avoid using tobacco products, such as cigarettes, snuff and chewing tobacco. 2  Choose most of the foods you eat from plant sources. 3  Limit your intake of high-fat foods, particularly from animal sources. 4  Be physically active and achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Smoking-Attributable Lung Cancer. 1  Smoking, a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively.

Linear fluorescent light bulbs are measured in two ways length and diameter. The length is measured from the end the pins. The most common sizes in length for T12's and T8's are 12, 15, 18, 24, 36 and 48 inches long. Howerver, T5 light bulbs are metric and standard sizes are not the same as T12 and T8. Some of their common sizes are around 22, 34 and 46 inches. The second measurement is the diameter of the light bulb. Fluorescent tube light bulbs are measured in 1/8 of inch increments. So a T12 light bulb is 12 x 1/8 of an inch, which equals 1 1/2 inches in diameter (T8 equals an inch and T5 equals 5/8 of an inch) length of the wire, and A x is its cross-sectional area. 1. Measure the length of the filament in the bulb: L = _____ m (The resistance of the other wires in the bulb is small enough to be ignored.

As a commercial driver in the trucking industry, you may never have to sit behind a desk. A: Yes, they are free to you as long as you drive for the sponsoring company for a few months. The cost is covered by a big trucking company. They need new drivers and you need a new driving career, so it's a win-win situation. Here is a list of most not-company-sponsored truck driving schools. Most people who want to become commercial drivers choose to get their training at local truck driving schools. But another option exists—one that allows you to get paid while you learn. Through company-sponsored CDL training, you can learn how to drive commercial vehicles at no cost to you. Below is a basic breakdown of the difference between the three levels. 1  A CDL-A allows you to operate a commercial vehicle with a trailer where the trailer weighs more than 10,000 lbs. and the combined weight of the vehicle and trailer exceeds 26,001 lbs. when fully loaded. Note that most truck drivers are paid by the mile, and regulations only allow for 70 hours of driving within an eight-day period. There are also additional regulations for how those 70 hours are used (such as requirements for rest breaks, etc).**. Q: Is there any difference between truck driving school and CDL training? A: Yes, there is a big difference. In school, you pretty much learn some very basic maneuvers and get your commercial driver’s license Class A (or CDL Class A).

            "input": "Density is defined as mass per unit volume; mathematically, we would write: or mass m density d Volume V = = For any pure substance or homogenous mixture, density is an intensive quantity, which means that its value is the same no matter how much of the substance is present. Density expresses the proportional relationship between mass and volume of the substance. If the density of a particular substance is given in grams per milliliter, it indicates the number of grams present in 1 milliliter of that substance. To calculate the density (usually represented by the Greek letter ρ) of an object, take the mass (m) and divide by the volume (v): ρ = m / v. The SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m3). It is also frequently represented in the cgs unit of grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). A concept related to density is the specific gravity (or, even more appropriate, relative density) of a material, which is the ratio of the material's density to the density of water. An object with a specific gravity less than 1 will float in water, while a specific gravity greater than 1 means it will sink. As a result, temperature and pressure can greatly affect the volume of a substance, especially gases. As with mass, increasing and decreasing the amount of material also increases and decreases the volume of the substance. Density. Density is calculated by dividing the mass by the volume (density = mass/volume). For example, 10 grams of freshwater has a volume of 10 milliliters. This results in a density of one gram per milliliter (10 g ÷ 10 mL = 1 g/mL). Unlike mass and volume, increasing the amount of material measured does not increase or decrease density. density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letterrho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:[1] Density is a measure of mass per unit of volume. Density is a measure of mass per volume. The average density of an object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. An object made from a comparatively dense material (such as iron) will have less volume than an object of equal mass made from some less dense substance (such as water). Perhaps the highest density known is reached in neutron star matter. #Density# = #Mass/Volume# To solve the equation for Mass, rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides times Volume in order to isolate Mass, then plug in your known values (Density and Volume). Then solve for Mass. #Mass# = #Density x Volume# Example. The density of copper is #8.933 g/cm^3#. Density equals mass divided by volume: d = m/v So the density will vary depending on how the mass and the volume vary. If you know two of the values, you can plug them into the equation and use algebra to solve for the missing value. Specific gravity is a comparison of the density of a given material to the density of water. Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter (at 4 degrees C). That makes the math really easy. 1.93 g/cc compared to 1 g/cc equals a specific gravity of 1.93 for the clay in the brick. Note that specific gravity has no units associated with it. It's a number only. We've used mass and volume to find density, and then compared the density of our stuff to that of water to find its specific gravity. Piece of cake.

The green layer you see is called tarnish and forms when brass is exposed to the carbon and sulfur dioxides in the air. It's basically a thin layer of corrosion that forms and it can only be eliminated with a thorough cleaning which requires you to remove some of the surface and patina of the piece. But it might be logical for it to be gold-plated, as it has to do with the sun. If one were to take something of bronze and coat it with a thin layer of gold somehow (maybe just by hammering thin strips of gold around it; I don't suppose any other techniques were around in the bronze age), would that stop the bronze corroding? Patina (/ ˈ p æ t ɪ n ə / or / p ə ˈ t iː n ə /) is a thin layer that variously forms on the surface of copper, bronze and similar metals (tarnish produced by oxidation or other chemical processes), or certain stones, and wooden furniture (sheen produced by age, wear, and polishing), or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure.

So if there is no heartbeat, the heart is not contracting, the blood is not circulating through the body, and there is no oxygen supply. Other tissues and organs can live longer without oxygen. For example an arm or leg can survive up to 6 hours. That is why if there is a deep cut or wound, a tourniquet can be applied to stop the flow of blood to a limb for several hours if needed.

Oolitic limestone was used to build the Pentagon as well as other buildings around the world, such as Buckingham Palace and the Empire State Building. Scientists have discovered that oolitic limestone is actually a material which was made out of microbes that existed 200 million years ago, at the time of the Jurassic era when dinosaurs were still present on the Earth. OOLITIC LIMESTONE. Oolitic limestone is a carbonate rock made up mostly of ooliths (or ooids) which are sand-sized carbonate particles that have concentric rings of CaCO 3. These rings are formed around grains of sand or shell fragments that were rolled around on the shallow sea floor, gathering layer after layer of limestone. How did oolitic limestone form? Previously, scientists thought that the ooids formed from grains rolled on the seafloor and then accumulated layers of sediment. “Oolitic limestone is a carbonate rock made up mostly of ooliths (or ooids) which are sand-sized carbonate particles that have concentric rings of CaCO3. These rings are formed around grains of sand or shell fragments that were rolled around on the shallow sea floor, gathering layer after layer of limestone,” University College London gave an explanation on its website. Limestone is by definition a rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite by weight. All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials. These can be small particles of quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, pyrite, siderite, and other minerals. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) in the form of the mineral calcite. It most commonly forms in clear, warm, shallow marine waters. It is usually an organic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, and fecal debris. Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising at least 80% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Limestones can be deposited in both marine and fresh water environments, the former being more common, and can take many forms such as those described below. Chalk is a pure, soft, well-jointed limestone composed primarily of the calcareous remains of micro-organisms called coccoliths and foraminifera. Pure white chalk contains more than 90% CaCO3 and is usually found in thick beds.

The cube have:. -- six (6) faces. A cube is a three dimensional shape that features all right angles and a height, width and depth that are all equal. 1  A cube has 6 square faces. 2  A cube has 8 points (vertices). 3  A cube has 12 edges. 4  Things that are shaped like a cube are often referred to as ‘cubic’. A cube has:   8 vertices (or corners)6 faces,12 edges Cube means a 3 dimensional figure. Its faces are in square shape. Cube has 6 square faces, attached by one edge of a …square with another edge of another square . Two types of cubes are there one is solid cube and other is hollow cube. Let's say, we have n-dimensional cube (I assume, that length of edge is 1, but it can be some a, where a∈R [1]). Here, corner of this cube looks like this: (x1,x2,…,xn). For every xi there are 2 possibilities: xi=0 or xi=1 (xi=a in general). So, this cube has 2n corners. How many corners does it have, how many edges? PRESENTER Well, corners we could describe, I suppose, as being the pointy bits on the shape. It's where two lines meet. Vertices, Edges and Faces. A vertex is a corner. An edge is a line segment that joins two vertices. A face is an individual surface. Let us look more closely at each of those: Vertices . A vertex (plural: vertices) is a point where two or more lines meet. It is a Corner. This tetrahedron has 4 vertices. A cube with side length 1 unit, called a “unit cube,” is said to have “one cubic unit” of volume, and can be used to measure volume. b.

As a rule, don't feed for an hour after coming in from exercise (and that includes a long car journey, to allow the system to settle down), and leave it 2 hours after feeding before exercising. A study published today in Diabetes Care found that three short walks each day after meals were as effective at reducing blood sugar over 24 hours as a single 45-minute walk at the same moderate pace. Even better, taking an evening constitutional was found to be much more effective at lowering blood sugar following supper. Factors to Consider When Eating Before a Walk. The timing and size of your meals before a walking workout makes a difference. If you’re consuming a large meal, wait for about three to four hours before walking.

Hyperthermia is a symptom that sets in when the body isn't able to maintain temperature properly -- it literally overheats. Hyperthermia can be serious. If the body's temperature rises too high, your organs can suffer damage. Generally, hyperthermia isn't a disease. It's a side effect of another problem, just like itching is a side effect of an allergic reaction to poison ivy. Once the bacteria that causes typhoid fever is consumed, it travels from the digestive system into the blood. As the bacteria travel through the body, Once the bacteria that causes typhoid fever is consumed, it travels from the digestive system into the blood. As the bacteria travel through the body, symptoms like high fever, headache, and overall fatigue can develop. The digestive system is also affected by the bacteria, which leads to stomach pain, diarrhea or constipation, and weight loss. The hypothalamus works with other parts of the body's temperature-regulating system, such as the skin, sweat glands and blood vessels — the vents, condensers and heat ducts of your body's heating and cooling system. The middle layer of the skin, or dermis, stores most of the body's water. The life-threatening disease typhoid fever results from the ongoing battle between the bacterial pathogen Salmonella and the immune cells of the body. A research group has now uncovered how the typhoid pathogen repeatedly manages to evade the host’s immune system. How Does Illness Cause Fever?

It's very important to understand that a fever is a normal response of the body to foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.

Your healthcare provider will work with you to create a treatment plan. From there, urine travels out of the kidneys through the ureters to be stored in the bladder (a muscular sac in the lower abdomen). The bladder expands as it fills and can hold about 2 cups (half a liter) of urine at any given time (the average adult produces about 6 cups, or 1½ liters, of pee per day). The Heart and Kidney Connection. Your heart and kidneys are two important organs in your body. They work together to keep you healthy. When one is affected, the other is too. In other words, your heart can affect the health of your kidneys, and your kidneys can affect the health of your heart. Your heart and kidneys are two important organs in your body. They work together to keep you healthy. What Kidneys Do. Although the two kidneys work together on many vital functions, people can live a normal, healthy life with just one kidney. In fact, some people are born with just one of these bean-shaped organs. If one kidney is removed, the remaining one will enlarge within a few months to take over the role of filtering blood on its own. Urine is a fluid that contains: You produce between two and three pints of urine a day. The actual amount depends on how much you eat, drink and sweat, and whether you're taking medication such as diuretics (water tablets). Urine drains from your kidneys to your bladder through tubes called ureters. Your bladder. Your bladder is the hollow muscular organ that stores your urine. It's a bit like a floppy balloon – as your bladder fills, it expands to store the urine. On average, your bladder can hold 400 to 600ml of urine for up to about five hours. The muscle in your bladder wall is called the detrusor muscle. The detrusor muscle relaxes to allow your bladder to fill. When you go to the toilet, it contracts to squeeze out urine. Surprisingly when you remove the gall bladder, when multiple stones are there, digestion is not affecetd. Probably gall bladder was already functionless and so patient is used to it. Microscopic structure of Liver is fascinating. It is beyond the imagination, the three dimentional structure of liver. So you have a portal triad, contening branch of hepatic artery, portal vein and bile duct. In the center of 6 portal triads you have a central vein. There are valves that prevent urine from flowing back towards the kidneys. Urinary Bladder The urinary bladder is a sac-like hollow organ used for the storage of urine. The urinary bladder is located along the body’s midline at the inferior end of the pelvis. As the waste is added, the bladder fills with urine. Once it is full, the bladder empties all of the wastes. On its own, the digestive system’s main purpose is to digest food and provide nutrients for the body. The urinary system is responsible for removing liquid waste that the body does not need. A prolapse is the protrusion of a pelvic organ into the vagina: 1  the bladder can prolapse causing a bulge in the front wall of the vagina. 2  the bowel can prolapse causing a bulge in the back wall of the vagina. 3  the womb can prolapse into the vagina from above and can sometimes be visible at the entrance to the vagina. Your kidneys are powerful chemical factories and have the following jobs: 1  Clean your blood of waste products and extra water. 2  Help control blood pressure. 3  Keep bones healthy and strong. 4  Help make red blood cells. 5  Keep the balance of minerals in your blood (like sodium, phosphorous, and potassium) Query: how do the kidneys and bladder work together",

All my friends are jealous because they've tried and failed to produce fruit. How long does it usually take for a pineapple to be ready to pick after it forms? I have 2 and one is about 4-5 months old and only about 6-7 inches tall, not counting the crown(very firm still) and 4-5 inches in diameter. The other is also 4-5 months old but only 4-5 inches tall and 4-5 inches in diameter. Very slow-growing plants, pineapples can take between 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years to fully mature.

I agree, do support your pineapple because the one I grew here fruited in the spring after 1 yr in a pot and keeping overwinter in the unheated garage. It grew to about a little over softball size and then grew a really huge green top on it. In size the fruits are up to 12 in. long and weigh 1 to 10 pounds or more. CULTURE Location: Pineapples should be planted where the temperature remains warmest, such as the south side of a home, or in a sunny portion of the garden. Soil: The best soil for The pineapple reached England in 1660 and began to be grown in greenhouses for its fruit around 1720. Adaptation: The pineapples is a tropical or near-tropical plant, but will usually tolerate brief exposures to 28° F. Prolonged cold above freezing retards growth, delays maturity and causes the fruit to be more acid. How Long to Get Fruit. Growing a pineapple plant from the top of a mature fruit can take upwards of 2 1/2 years before the plant is mature enough to blossom. If growing from suckers, it can take 1 1/2 years, and from slips, roughly one year to maturity. Query: how long for pineapple to mature",

WEDNESDAY, March 12 (HealthDay News) -- A new survey reports that teenagers spend far too many hours a week in front of TVs and computers, and those in poor neighborhoods have even more screen time.. Girls who lived in the poorest neighborhoods were five times more likely to spend the most time in front of screens than those in the richest neighborhoods. The girls in poor neighborhoods might be more vulnerable to perceptions that their neighborhoods are not safe, Barnett suggested. Half of the boys and a quarter of the girls reported spending an average of more than 42 hours a week in front of electronic screens. TV was the most common form of screen use, accounting for 85 percent of the time. It finds that teenaged girls now spend an average of seven-and-a-half- hours watching screens, compared with 3.5 hours of TV viewing in 1995. Younger children fare slightly better - in 1995, five to 10-year-olds averaged around two-and-a-half-hours of TV. Fast-forward to 2014 and screen time has risen to four-and-a-half hours.

From your lips to your hips in just 3 hours: From digesting a cupcake to healing after surgery or even having an orgasm, how long it takes your body to work By Chloe Lambert for the Daily Mail and Roger Dobson for The Mail on Sunday Studies have shown that the entire process takes about an average of 50 hours for healthy people, but can vary between 24 and 72, based on a number of factors.

The time passing through the large intestine is much longer, averaging about 40 hours. For men the average time to digest food is shorter overall than it is for women.

How long does it take for the food to go to through the esophagus and into the stomach? 20 minutes In all reality, it only takes food about 7 seconds to travel down the esophagus and into the stomach. This is a very interesting question. There are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. To start, the type of food matters. Some foods are more complex, requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. The transit through the stomach and small intestine is usually normal and it takes around 3 hours to hit the colon.

On the other hand, if you eat vegetables and fruits, they're out of your system in less than 12 hours.'.

Cast iron also provides many other benefits in home waste systems that still makes it a good choice for homes. For all of its good points cast iron does have some problems related to it.

These are long periods of time in which stocks make little progress. Then there are cyclical bears, which can come in the middle of a long secular bear or even a secular bull. The chart below shows the three secular bears over the last ninety years. As you can see, the defining characteristic for secular bears is that stocks make no progress for long periods of time. The average bears market last 18 months and has an average of a 30% decline. The average bear market lasts about one year and two months, (The average bull market lasts about three years and seven months.) At least till obama is history. While the nominal Dow begins at 39 points in our chart, adjusting for inflation brings its real value up to 1,426 points. One thing to notice is just how long most secular market cycles are.

If you’d invested twenty thousand dollars in the Dow index eight years ago, it would now be worth about sixty-four thousand dollars. Secular bull gains totaled 2075% for an average of 415%. Secular bear losses totaled -329% for an average of -65%. Secular bull years total 80 versus 52 for the bears, a 60:40 ratio. This last bullet probably comes as a surprise to many people.

The current bull run is now four years old and up about 120%, making it significantly above average by both measures. How do bull markets start and end?

No matter your age, for every 10 years you delay starting to save for retirement, you need to save 3 times as much each month to catch up. How long will you live in retirement? Based on current estimates, a 65 year old man can expect to live approximately 18 years in retirement, and a 65 year old woman can expect to live about 20 years, but many people live longer. Planning to live well into your 90s can help you avoid outliving your income. The worksheet takes into account some factors that impact your retirement savings. Here are your basic choices: 1  Do nothing. 2  Roll your assets over into a plan offered by a new employer, if you have one. 3  Cash out your account and use the money to pay for the transition from your job to whatever is next for you. 4  Roll the account into an IRA. However, you must withdraw your entire balance (or begin receiving monthly payments from the TSP or from the TSP annuity vendor) by April 1 of the year following the year you turn 70½ (or following the year you separate, if you are already over age 70½ when you leave Federal service). When you retire from federal service or you separate from government for any other reason, loans from your TSP program come due. The loan has to be paid back within 90 days of your separation. If you don't pay it back, the TSP will treat the money that isn't repaid as a distribution and you will have to pay taxes on it. For years you have been contributing to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), building your retirement savings. After you leave federal service, have you considered what you should do with your TSP savings? You could choose one or any combination of these options: Leave your money in TSP. Withdraw all or some of your TSP funds. Purchase an annuity. There is one withdrawal option available with TSP that is not available with an IRA. If you leave federal service after you turn 55, but before you are 59 ½, you can withdraw money without the 10% early withdrawal penalty you would incur with an IRA. If you left federal service before you turned 55, or you transfer your TSP account to an IRA, there is a 10% penalty for most funds withdrawn prior to age 59 ½. There are number of issues to consider when deciding what to do with your TSP when you retire. Downsides of TSP Participation. 1  Less Take Home Pay. The fact is, contributing to the TSP will decrease your take-home pay. However, when you factor in agency contributions and tax benefits, the downside may not be as extreme as you think. 2  Limited Fund Choices. Contributing as much as you can to TSP retirement coverage is simply a smart financial move. Invest money in yourself and your future instead of giving the government an interest free loan in order to get back a large refund check annually after taxes. In addition, you are double-taxed on the interest – you repay the loan with after-tax dollars, and the funds are taxed again when you withdraw. However, if you want to borrow from a TSP to pay off bills, there a few things you will have to remember. Determine Eligibility To apply for a loan from your TSP account, you must be an active employee of the federal government or a uniformed military member and you must be in pay status. As a retiree, you have three options for Basic coverage: 1  75% Reduction: Monthly cost before age 65 = $.325 per $1,000 of Basic Insurance Amount (BIA); after age 65 = $0. 2  50% Reduction: Monthly cost before age 65 = $.925 per $1,000 of BIA; after age 65 = $.60 per $1,000.

Submarine volcanoes can be detected by the presence of high rock content and steam above water surface. Maps / Tsunami / How Do Volcanic Eruptions Generate Tsunamis How Do Volcanic Eruptions Generate Tsunamis Primarily a tsunami is generated when any natural or artificial force disturbs large volume of water particularly or largely in vertical direction through sea floor. These submarine volcanoes form high slope pillars over their craters as compared to their on surface counterparts, which is due to the rapid cooling effect of water and buoyancy. The process of tsunami generation in such cases can be understood through the concept of phreatomagmatic eruption. Such an eruption is an explosive interaction between water and magma, which produces fine grained tephra with the emission of magmatic gases and steam. Volcanoes and tsunami generation. Volcanic eruptions can also produce tsunamis. The rules are similar to the rules for earthquakes. In order for a volcano to produce a tsunami you need: 1. A volcano near the coast. 2. An eruption that sends a large enough volume of material into the water to displace a significant volume of water. If a large eruption sends a great volume of material into the water, it creates the vertical disturbance necessary to make a tsunami. Volcanic eruptions could generate tsunami by more than one method, but only volcanoes sitting in water or beside larger body of water. 1  Tremors. 2  Landslide. 3  Explosion of the caldera. Tsunamis are generated by abrupt massive movements (changes) in the sea floor. An eruption of a volcano in or adjacent to the sea may be accompanied by earthquakes, and an earthquake may move the sea floor sufficiently to generate a tsunami. A second possible way for a volcano to create a tsunami might be due to a landslide from the side of a volcano. Such a mass movement of material into the sea would also displace water, and could generate a tsunami. Additionally, sometimes volcanoes explode violently, and that mass movement of material could also create a tsunami. One example is a tsunami expected to be caused by a future eruption of a volcano on La Palma in the Canary Islands. The last eruption caused deep faults in the West side of the volcano slope, which is expected to slide into the Atlantic ocean in a future eruption and generate a mega tsunami. Print. If we are going to attempt to assess the risk of a tsunami at some particular place on the planet, we must first understand how to make a tsunami. Earthquakes and volcanoes generate the great majority of tsunamis, and the theory of plate tectonics explains the cause of earthquakes and volcanoes. So, we'll start with the world's briefest review of plate tectonics. Plate tectonics is the Grand Unifying Theory of geosciences, but it's actually not that old. How Do Volcanic Eruptions Generate Tsunamis. Primarily a tsunami is generated when any natural or artificial force disturbs large volume of water particularly or largely in vertical direction through sea floor. These water waves have very high frequency and very small wavelengths in onshore areas, which. There are three distinct types of plate boundaries, shown illustrated by the drawing below both as separate block diagrams as well as situated within their appropriate geologic environment. 1  At transform boundaries, two plates slide past each other. 2  At divergent boundaries, plates move away from each other.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is the FHA's parent agency and it offers many homes for bid purchase. HUD homes range in condition from very poor to excellent, and all come with clean titles free of past liens. HUD also uses a specific process to determine the final bid price it will accept on one of its homes. HUD Home Pricing When HUD takes a home into its inventory it has a HUD-approved real estate appraiser go through it. HUD expects higher offers for newer listings, although bids on new listings can be lower than the list price. If you find a home you want to bid on that has been listed for 90 days or longer, HUD might accept less than 85 percent of the listed price. We suggest that you submit a reasonable, but low offer first â say 65% of asking price. If there are no other bidders, HUD will counter with a number they will accept. The counter offer HUD sends out is the NET amount they will accept, so you have to add the Determining the Minimum Acceptable Bid for a HUD Home. by Mike on November 2, 2007. In order to buy a HUD home, your offer has to meet two criteria. First, your offered price has to beat your competition. Second, your offer must meet the super-secret HUD minimum acceptable bid. If the home has been listed for three months or more, you will have more bargaining power. The low-ball offer is a safer strategy in this scenario. If the listing is new on the market, HUD will generally accept 85 - 88 percent of the list price as net proceeds to HUD. This means if you offer an amount that allows them to net more than 85 percent of the listing price, there's a good chance they'll accept your offer. See the 88 percent strategy below. At that time, when a property first hit the HUD list, the minimum bid was 87% of list price. However, the minimum bid dropped to 80% after 60 days. Which brings us to the second point–the minimum bid is a function of time on the market. When the housing market hit the skids, the HUD minimum bid calculation changed. By the time that Rob and I bought The Loft (click here for the name explanation), the How can I buy a HUD home? Answer: Read our section on how to buy a HUD home. Then look at the listings of HUD homes available. If you find a home that interests you, you'll need to contact a HUD-approved real estate broker (most brokers are HUD-approved), who can submit a bid for you. Successful bids are posted right on the page for your state. For more information, you may also contact our FHA Resource Center by email at answers@hud.gov or by phone at (800) CALLFHA. For insured homes: 1  15 day owner occupant, government agencies, and non-profit only bid period. The first ten days of this bid period HUD collects all the bids and subsequently reviews them on the next business day. Thereafter for the next five days, HUD reviews any bids received the following day. HUD allows your agent to put up to 5% commission you have to agree to that. So if the listing price is $100,000 HUD will allow basically $83,000 net to them. Ok you have $3,000 agent commission and probably and figure 1% for closing fees to be safe.

If this is the first time you are applying for a Work Permit, you need to declare your business activity. You should also refer to the requirements for Work Permit. The duration of the Work Permit is usually 2 years, but it may be shorter depending on: This action affects approximately 2,100 3-year DACA work permits mistakenly issued after the court order. It also affects approximately 500 3-year DACA work permits that were issued before the court order, returned to USCIS as undeliverable and then re-mailed to updated addresses after the court order. USCIS issues US Work Permits (Employment Authorization Documents or EADs) in the following categories: 1  EAD: This document proves you are allowed to work in the United States. 2  Renewal EAD: You should apply for a renewal Employment Authorization Document / US Work Permit six months before your original EAD expires. The school shall retain a copy of the work permit application (CDE Form B1-1) and the work permit (CDE Form B1-4) until the end of the fourth year after the work permit was issued. Those files may be retained on a computer disk(s) and, if requested, can be printed for examination (EC Section 41020; 5 CCR Section 16026). Note that not everyone who has a right to work in the United States needs to apply for a work permit. For example, most people admitted to the U.S. on temporary work visas for specific employers, such as H-1B visas, need not (and should not) apply for an EAD. They can go straight to Social Security and get a card. Who Can Apply for a Work Permit If you are still eligible for employment authorization but your EAD will be expiring or has expired, you should file for a renewal EAD by submitting a new Form I-765 and filing fee (if required), unless a fee waiver is requested and approved. Generally, you should not file for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before your original EAD expires. Once USCIS receives your 3-year work permit, we will issue you a Confirmation of Compliance notice: 1  Canceling the Notice of Intent to Terminate and. 2  Confirming your 2-year deferred action and employment authorization.

You’ll need to see your doctor to find out if you have it. Your doctor will give you a complete physical exam. You may get a throat culture to rule out strep throat, which has symptoms that are similar to mono. Your doctor may also take a sample of blood to check for abnormal white blood cells. You may also get a heterophile antibody test. It checks your blood for special antibodies that your body makes to fight off a viral infection. Your physician will start by taking a complete medical history, and will then perform a physical exam to see if there are any signs of infection. If mono is suspected, the doctor will order a blood test, known as a heterophil or monospot test, to confirm the diagnosis. Are blood tests always definitive? The monospot test is not perfect. Infectious mononucleosis is a contagious illness sometimes called mono. Learn about its symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Skip directly to search Skip directly to A to Z list Skip directly to navigation Skip directly to page options Skip directly to site content If you have heterophile antibodies in your blood, then your monospot test is positive.. A positive monospot test accompanied by the symptoms of mono results in a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. However, monospot tests can be false-positive, about 10-15% of the time, particularly in early stages of the illness. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate. Physical examination The presence of an enlarged spleen, and swollen posterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. Serious complications are uncommon, occurring in less than 5% of cases: 1  CNS complications include meningitis, encephalitis, hemiplegia, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Prior infectious mononucleiosis has been linked to the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). If the mono test is persistently negative, a test specific for EBV antibodies may be used to help confirm or rule out the presence of an EBV infection. A strep test may also be ordered along with a mono test to determine whether a person's sore throat is due to strep throat (group A streptococcal infection) instead of or in addition to mononucleosis. Best Answer: Mono tests include: Monospot test (heterophil test). This quick screening test detects a recent mono infection. A sample of blood is placed on a microscope slide and mixed with other substances. If mono is present, the blood clumps (agglutinates). Monospot testing can usually detect antibodies 2 to 9 weeks after a person is infected. It generally is not used to diagnose mono that started more than 6 months earlier. EBV antibody test. For this test, a sample of blood is mixed with a substance that attaches to antibodies against EBV. Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is a contagious illness typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus . This infectious disease can be spread by saliva, and the incubation period for mono is four to eight weeks. Query: how is mono tested for",

            "input": "Dog Digestion Time The standard for dog digestion time varies between different breeds and even between individual animals. Similarly, the time that it will take for your dog to digest his food also depends upon what type of food he eats. Generally speaking, raw food and canned food will move through his system faster than dry food; it typically takes between 4 and 6 hours for a dog to process a meal's worth of canned food. On the other hand, it may take as many as 8 to 10 hours for the same dog to process dry food completely. Still, by monitoring your own pet's tendencies in terms of digestion based on the food that he eats, you can develop a sense for how long it takes him to do so. Additional Differences There are a number of important other differences between human and canine digestion that pet owners should keep in mind. Easy to Swallow. A dog's mouth works differently from a human's. For starters, he has 42 teeth and nearly 2,000 taste buds, while a person typically has 32 teeth and as many as 10,000 taste buds. Whatever remains after the dog's small intestine has done its job, is then processed in a few hours by the large intestine, and moved through the colon. In all, the entire process, from the time a dog bites into his food to the time waste is produced, can take about 10 hours to a couple of days. There are a number of other factors that may contribute to a difference in the average time that it takes your dog to digest his meal. 1  These include the following, among many others: 2  Exercise level. 3  Overall health level. 4  Weight. 5  Amount of water consumed. 6  Preexisting diseases and conditions. It is for this reason primarily that pet owners must vigilantly brush their dog's teeth. Do this about once per week in order to maintain your pet's oral health. Ask a vet for additional information about how to best deal with the digestion differences between you and your dog. A dog's mouth works differently from a human's.

These include the following, among many others: 1  Exercise level. 2  Overall health level. 3  Weight. 4  Amount of water consumed. 5  Preexisting diseases and conditions. The dog's pancreas will begin producing enzymes that will help in breaking down the food; the stomach wall also has glands that produce necessary acids. Since what goes into a dog's stomach can be anything from grass, meat, kibble or bone, the acids must be particularly powerful (in comparison, the acid in a dog's digestion is about three times stronger than in a human's). A dog's stomach will work on breaking down food for roughly eight hours before passing it into the small intestine. End of the Line The broken-down food will remain in the small intestine for up to about two days, depending on the meal. End of the Line. The broken-down food will remain in the small intestine for up to about two days, depending on the meal.

Induction cooktops are powered by electricity, but the “element” that rests beneath the ceramic or glass surface functions like a powerful magnet, which generates a magnetic field. Advantages of induction cooktops. Photo: Gas burners are easy to control, but waste energy by heating the surrounding air and the cooktop as well as the food in the pan. Since they're naked flames, they're more likely to cause a fire than any electric method of cooking. By changing mechanical energy into electrical energy, the generator relied upon the basic principle of electromagnetic induction, that of passing an electrical conductor through a magnetic field. As previously explained, when one side of a coil passes through the magnetic field, first in one direction and then in the other direction, an alternating current (magnetic flux) is the end result. We'll also lift the lid on what you should know before buying, installing or working with induction cooktops. Before we get to that, let's take a look at the benefits of induction cooktops and the surprisingly simple physics of electromagnetic induction. Photo: Ordinary electric charging: all the components of the transformer are contained inside the charger. How induction chargers work. So far so good—but what happens with something like an electric toothbrush, which has no power lead to plug into the wall? This induction charging process can be used to charge a pair of pop cans. It is a simple enough experiment to be repeated at home. Two pop cans are mounted on Styrofoam cups using scotch tape. Induction and Electromagnetism Understanding electromagnetic induction. Motors, transformers, audio speakers, radio transmission and generators work using the wild and complex phenomena of electromagnetism. Understanding the behavior of electromagnetism is a large subject of study. What is electrical induction? Electrical induction is also called magnetic induction. It is the ‘voltage’ produced in a conductor due to its reaction with a magnetic field. Health and safety: Pacemakers But the main issue is with which cookware you can use with them. Because of the way they work, many types of pans just don't heat up with induction cooktops. If you have copper bottom, glass or aluminum pans, they don't get hot when you put them on an induction cooktop. How they work METAL OR PLASTIC. First, induction heating works directly only with conductive materials, normally metals. Plastics and other non-conductive materials can often be heated indirectly by first heating a conductive metal susceptor which transfers heat to the non-conductive material.

The head of the comet and the beginning of its long tail are shown. Short, straight streaks are background stars. Discovered by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp in 1995, the Hale-Bopp comet came within 1.315 AU of Earth in 1997. One AU is 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). Scientists have computed its orbital period so you can find out when Hale-Bopp will return. Unlike a long-period comet, the next perihelion passage of a numbered periodic comet can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. Periodic comets sometimes bear the same name repeatedly (e.g. the nine Shoemaker–Levy comets or the twenty-four NEAT comets); the IAU system distinguishes between them either through the number prefix or by the full designation (e. g. 181P and 192P are both Comet Shoemaker–Levy). Halley’s comet belonged to the Neptune group and today falls into the short period comet category. In the early twentieth century these were called “Periodic comets.” At the time, what we now call long period comets were thought to be from beyond the solar system. Short-period Comets A comet with an orbital period of less than 200 years is known as a short-period comet or a ‘periodic comet’. These are now divided into Jupiter-family comets with periods less than 20 years and orbits that do not extend much beyond Jupiter, and Halley-type comets with periods of 20–200 years and highly inclined orbits. low orbital inclinations mostly prograde large eccentricities most from Kuiper Belt eventually destroyed by collisions/sublimating into oblivion orbital period less than 100 years Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets appear to follow very different fading laws. The JFCs are active over a lifetime of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages. Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock or rubble that can resemble an asteroid. Because no planets have retrograde orbits, we must ask why so many long-period comets are retrograde, while few short-period comets are. Intermediate-Period Comets. Only 104 comets have orbital periods between 100 and 700 years. So, we have two completely different populations of comets—short-period and long-period—plus a few in between. The short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper Belt, an area outside Neptune's orbit (from about 30 to 50 AU) that has many icy comet-like objects. The long-period comets tend to have orbits that are randomly oriented, and not necessarily anywhere near the ecliptic. A short period comet is conventionally defined as a comet having an orbital period of less than 200 years. What is the maximum possible aphelion distance for a short period comet with a perihelion of 0.5 AU? Where does this place the comet relative to the outer planets?

            "input": "CT Scan Frequently Asked Questions What is a CT scan? A CT scan — also called Computerized Tomography or just CT—is an X-ray technique that produces images of your body that visualize internal structures in cross section rather than the overlapping images typically produced by conventional X-ray exams. CT scans use an X-ray unit that rotates around your body and a powerful computer. The result with CT scans is a set of cross-sectional images, like slices, of the inside of your body. Should I do anything special to prepare for a CT scan? How you prepare for a CT scan depends on which part of your body is being scanned. You may be asked to remove your clothing and wear a hospital gown. You’ll need to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, that might interfere with image results. Q&A: About Your CT Scan What is a CT scan? CT, which stands for Computed Tomography (sometimes referred to as a “CAT” scan), is a fast, painless diagnostic tool doctors can use to see inside the body. Physicians use the information they get from a CT scan to rule out or confirm the presence of certain abnormalities or diseases. A CT scan has many uses, but is particularly well-suited to quickly examine people who may have internal injuries from car accidents or other types of trauma. A CT scan can be used to visualize nearly all parts of the body and is used to diagnose disease or injury as well as to plan medical, surgical or radiation treatment. CT of the head is an X-ray-based procedure in which images (pictures) are taken of the entire brain. CT scans of the head/brain can provide more detailed information about brain tissue and brain structures than standard X-rays of the head. Therefore, this can provide more information related to injuries and brain disease. You might have an injection of contrast medium (a type of dye) through a small thin tube (cannula) in your arm. 1  This can: 2  make you feel hot and flushed for a minute or two. 3  give you a metallic taste in your mouth. 4  make you feel like you’re passing urine but you aren’t – this feeling is common and passes quickly. How long does it take? A CT scan can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on what part of the body is being scanned. It also depends on how much of your body the doctors want to look at and whether contrast dye is used. It often takes more time to get you into position and give the contrast dye than to take the pictures. For some types of CT scan, a 'contrast agent' is used to make certain parts of the patient more visible to x-rays. The contrast agent is in the form of a liquid that is injected into the patient prior to scanning. This liquid has iodine in it, and shows up well in CT scans. At our hospital, it'd be very unusual for a CT scan to take more than an hour or two to be read, most are done within 30 minutes. From there, the question is how long does it take for the report to get to the ordering doctor? What will I feel during the scan? CT scanning causes no pain, just as a routine X-ray is painless. If intravenous contrast is used, you may feel warm and flush and get a metallic taste in your mouth. These sensations normally disappear after a few minutes. How long will the scan take? The time required will depend upon the type of scan. If oral contrast is required, about 45 to 60 minutes is needed for the contrast to move through your digestive tract. Actual scan times vary from a few seconds to several minutes. If no oral contrast is required, the examination will take about 15 to 30 minutes, including the time for intravenous preparation and interview. In some cases additional scanning is required as scans are tailored to suit individual diagnostic needs. I do think a lot of hospitals are concerned with customer satisfaction so I think elevating your displeasure with the scan results policy may go a long way. Most hospitals have surveys or complaint forms and if neither of those apply a letter to the Hospital administration may be order. Query: how long does it take for a ct scan?",

Use the right shampoo and conditioner. Dry, brittle ends look like they're begging for a haircut; so a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner can buy you extra weeks—maybe even months—between trims. The latest from Living Proof, a line developed by MIT scientists, contains a special molecule called PolyFluoroEster that smoothes, hydrates and strengthens each strand. It depends on how hard you on it. If it goes through a lot of heat and is always being styled, I'd say every 5-6 weeks. But just enough cut off to get rid of the dead ends. Or it will be worthless to grow your hair out resulting in long split ends. If you do almost nothing to your hair, I'd say every 2 months. Make sure that you get almost all your split ends off when you get it trimmed, or they will just keep growing longer or breaking off. Either way, it isn't good. If you color or highlight your long hair, it is even more likely to be damaged. Regular haircuts help keep your hair strong and healthy. Long hair should be trimmed at least every eight to 12 weeks. If you notice more breakage or split ends, it could be cut as frequently as every six to eight weeks. Be specific with your hairstylist when you're getting your haircut. Best Answer: You should really have a trim every 6-8 weeks to egt rid of split ends. =] ... How Long Between Haircuts ... Depends. If you want long hair, don't cut ... Their unprocessed hair is basically the healthiest it will ever be. If your hair has never been colored and you haven't yet exposed it to the rigors of frequent hot-tool usage (and you're in your early 20s), you can go up to three months between trims without any risk of looking frayed, says hairstylist Nathaniel Hawkins. “When I give a haircut, of course it’s going to look good — you just got it cut,” said Garrett Pike, a head barber at the Brooklyn-based chain Persons of Interest. “But I try to get the most out of every cut.”. Fresh, clean, and ready to face the world, a new chop’s got a kind of empowering quality—it’s as if anything you do in the next 24 to 48 hours will be made infinitely more awesome by the precision of your mane. Stylists want you to use a hydrating hair mask once a week. This is especially true if you're planning an extreme shift, such as from black to blonde. Apply the mask to towel-dried hair three inches down from the roots, then work through to the ends and leave it on for 20 minutes. Voila. With long, blunt-cut hair, trimming the ends of the hair is a simple matter of following the established line and removing the damaged ends. Yet with long-layered hairstyles, there is an alternative that works especially well. Brush out the hair to remove any tangles and section the hair in to workable divisions. But if you color your hair a different shade, you need to be vigilant about the upkeep. Piecuch says anywhere between four and eight weeks is the standard time for a new hair coloring appointment, but that timeframe can vary greatly based on individual factors.

The vet had to remove the top hard cover of the nail exposing the quick. We kept it bandaged up, but allowed it to air out daily. It took about five or six days for the quick to grow a new hard cover. So it depends on the way it is broken. Right now, by dog has another broken nail, but it is a pretty clean break, and he isn't limping. Best of luck to you and your dog. Hope it all goes well. To remedy this, you'll need to ask your vet or groomer to trim those nails as close to the quick as possible, but a bit at a time, regardless of how long the nails are. This will cause the quick to gradually recede. One of my bitches moaned and cried and screamed for the first 12 hours at home, the next day she was down a rabbit hole! Just make sure the wound doesn't look inflamed and is clean, and of course your dog doesnt worry it. A few days will probably be all you need to take off. Hope she's fine with it all. Generally, dogs start feeling better within 48 hours. Total recovery takes some time, as the nail needs to re-grow so to completely cover the vulnerable quick. Generally, this takes 2 weeks according to Dr. Fiona. As your dog recovers, try to avoid walking him on rocks, sand, snow, or mud for about two weeks. Most average cats and dogs take  fourteen days for their incisions to heal. Side note: that’s about how long it takes for people to heal, too. One tip is to look at the nail where the cut is, if it is white you can cut 2mm; and if you see a black little circle in the middle you stop because next is the quick (it worked for me and my little huge nails).

Blood test results should always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test, but typical [0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL]s for adults and [340 µmol/L] for new borns: Jaundice occurs as a result of excess bilirubin in. the blood.

Bilirubin: Bilirubin,, a brownish yellow pigment of bile, secreted by the liver in vertebrates, which gives to solid waste products (feces) their characteristic colour. It is produced in bone marrow cells and in the liver as the end product of red-blood-cell (hemoglobin) breakdown. Normally the body produces a total of about 260 mg of bilirubin per day. Almost 99 per cent of this is excreted in the feces; the remaining 1 per cent is excreted in the urine as urobilinogen. Bilirubin is a pigment in bile created during the breakdown of haemoglobin, which is then excreted from the body in bile. It is bilirubin which gives people the characte…ristic yellow colour in jaundice (whether that be caused by liver failure, obstruction or an increased breakdown of haemoglobin). the liver. To be transported in blood, bilirubin must be solubilized. By the very nature of being reversible, noncovalent binding to albumin the Unconjugated bilirubin bound to albumin is transported to the liver, where it is taken up by hepatocytes through carrier-mediated membrane transport and solubilised. Bilirubin metabolism: Applied physiology Xia Wang, Jayanta Roy Chowdhury , Namita Roy Chowdhury Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, USA KEYWORDS Bilirubin; Bilirubin glucuro-nides; UGT1A1; ABCC2 Summary Bilirubin is the breakdown product of the haem moiety of haemoglobin and other haemoproteins. Because of internal hydrogen bonding, bilirubin is water-insoluble and requires enzyme-mediated glucuronidation in the liver for biliary excretion. In normal circumstances, plasma bilirubin is mostly unconjugated and is tightly bound to circulating albumin. Urine bilirubin may also be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Biliary Excretion of Waste Products: Elimination of Bilirubin The liver is well known to metabolize and excrete into bile many compounds and toxins, thus eliminating them (usually) from the body. Examples can be found among both endogenous molecules (steroid hormones, calcium) and exogenous compounds (many antibiotics and metabolities of drugs). Bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver and excreted in the bile, giving the stools their characteristic colour. When it cannot escape freely into the bowel it accumulates in the blood, staining the skin to cause JAUNDICE. Query: how is bilirubin excreted from the body",

Franceille Fleurine of Massachusetts reportedly strikes two trees, smashing the back window of the bus, and then continues to drive her route.

Dr. Interstate Passenger Carrying Driver’s Guide to Hours of Service What Are the Hours-of-Service Regulations? As the driver of a bus, motorcoach, or other passenger-carrying vehicle, you have a lot of responsibility as you drive down the road. The biggest concern is safety. That brings us to the main reason for the hours-of-service regulations — to keep fatigued drivers off the public roadways. These regulations put limits in place for when and how long you may drive, with the idea that these limits will help make sure that you stay awake and alert while driving. Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC), also known as a Driver Qualification Card (DQC) For some jobs you’ll also need a digital tachograph card. You'll usually apply to bus or coach companies and train on the job. Before you start training, most employers will expect you to: be at least 18 (21 if you want to drive a bus or coach abroad) have held a full driving licence for at least 12 months. Goods vehicles: rules on drivers’ hours and tachographs Passenger vehicles: rules on drivers’ hours and tachographs Emergency exemption and temporary relaxation of drivers’ hours and working time rules My partner is a bus driver, his company says he can drive 7 hours before he is entitle to a break. showing them the regulation Alternatively, within any period of 8.5 hours in the working day, total breaks amounting to at least 45 minutes are taken so that the driver does not drive for more than 7 hours and 45 minutes. Bus drivers had a higher rate of work-related injuries and illnesses in 2016 than the national average. Most injuries to bus drivers are due to vehicle accidents. How to Become a Bus Driver. Bus drivers must have a commercial driver’s license (CDL). This can sometimes be earned during on-the-job training. According to the FMCSA, For every ten hours driving, the drivers need to take 8 consecutive hours off. If your company does operate vehicles every day of the week (Like Greyhound), your employer may assign you to the 70-hour/8-day schedule. This means that you are not allowed to drive after you’ve been on duty 70 hours in any 8 consecutive days. Once you reach the 70-hour limit, you will not be able to drive again until you have dropped below 70 hours for an 8-consecutive-day period. Heavy vehicle work time requirements in New Zealand are: 1  A break of at least 30 minutes every 5.5 hours of work time. 2  Maximum cumulative work time of 13 hours (plus 2x 30-minute breaks) in one cumulative work day before a 10-hour break is required, giving a total of 24 hours. It is such a grey area where for how long you can drive a bus or a coach until you need to take a break. If you are driving a bus under the GB Domestic rules (PSV375) your driving hours are ruled by the Transport Act 1968 (Part VI as amended) here is what is says. 96 Permitted driving time and periods of duty. Drivers may drive 10 hours in a twenty-four hour period according to Federal and State regulations.

            "input": "What could happen if my baby is premature? Preterm birth can cause serious health problems or even be fatal for a baby, particularly if it happens very early. In general, the more mature a baby is at birth, the better his chances of surviving and being healthy. Some preterm babies may have problems breathing. Prematurity also puts a baby at a greater risk for brain hemorrhage. The nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs may be affected too. Sometimes your baby needs to be born early because one of you has a medical problem. The most common medical reasons for inducing labor early include: Your baby isn’t growing. 36 weeks is NOT full-term. 9 months is 39.8 weeks, not 36 weeks. You should under NO circumstances induce a pregnancy early without a REAL MEDICAL reason. A baby's brain at 36 weeks has 2/3 less mass than a baby at 40 weeks. After the first trimester Ultrasounds can be inaccurate. Measurements, especially of weight can be off as much as 2-3 lbs. Almost all Western nations have banned elective inductions and C-sections. If there is no medical reason to induce DON'T do it. Once the baby is born care includes keeping the baby warm through skin to skin contact, supporting breastfeeding, treating infections, and supporting breathing. Preterm birth is the most common cause of death among infants worldwide. Wang and colleagues examined the records of infants born at the hospital over a three-year period and randomly selected 95 full-term infants, born at 37 weeks or more, and 90 near-term infants, born at 35 or 36 weeks.. However, going into premature labour can be linked with: 1  Having a very full and stretched womb (uterus). 2  Cervical weakness, or a short cervical length. 3  A history of spontaneous premature birth. 4  A bacterial infection in the bag containing the waters or in the amniotic fluid itself. 5  Your waters breaking early. 6  Heavy bleeding. Air travel is appropriate for most infants. Before you fly with your baby, however, consider: Your baby's age. Your baby's doctor might discourage unnecessary air travel shortly after birth. Newborns have developing immune systems and air travel might increase their risk of catching an infectious disease. If you choose to travel with an infant, frequently wash your hands or use hand sanitizer and avoid contact with obviously ill travelers. Had he been born at 34 weeks he probably would not have needed any help because 2 weeks in utero is much better and allows for much greater development than 2 weeks out. If you made it to 34 weeks you are probably in the clear (although that's not a guarentee either since a baby could be born at 40 weeks with problems). Most babies who make it to 36 weeks are perfectly fine and go home with mom. Babies born in a hospital with a level III NICU have a decent chance at survival at 24 weeks, but my OB feels more comfortable saying 26-28 weeks and birth weight is a factor. My friend delivered her twin boys at 24w4d. Baby A was 1lb7oz and Baby B was 1lb9oz. Baby B passed away after 10 days due to a brain bleed. Baby A spent 125 days in the NICU and came home healthy with no long-term complications that they have identified. Truthfully, long-term effects may no be known for a while. It is best for a baby to be born after 37 weeks but, many babies are ok that are born sooner. It just depends on the situation and why the baby comes early.

Share: Chemotherapy targets cancer cells through similar biological processes. For instance, early chemotherapy drugs attacked folate, which is a key component of cellular division. Since cancer cells divide more than normal cells, they are more greatly harmed by this drug. Newer chemotherapy agents target specific mutations in certain cancer cells, making their effects very specific to only the tumor. To your last point, radiation and chemo both can induce future cancers. Radiation therapy targets cancer cells in two ways. First, we shape the beam of radiation such that it conforms as closely as possible to the shape of the tumor. We also treat from multiple different angles, with all beams converging on the tumor. Best Answer: The short answer is that they don't differentiate between cell types. This is why there are side effects. There are a variety of different mechanisms that the chemo meds employ, down-regulating certain proteins from being made, binding certain receptors to trigger cell death, etc. You hit it when you said the chemo meds mostly target rapidly dividing cells (or highly metabolically active cells.) And we're able to be relatively tissue specific too, so different drugs have affinities for different tissues.

The studies also provided more evidence -- at least in their animal models -- of why the stem cells are an important target. Normally, stem cells make progenitor cells, which make specific cells that comprise the breast. In this sense, the tumor is targeted geometrically - the radiation is aimed at the tumor, and not normal tissue. Secondly, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation damage.

With a whisk, manually whisk in the sugar and yeast.

Reply. Roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch thick, into the shape of a rectangle measuring 12 by 18 inches. Smear your softened butter all over the dough. Then sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over the butter, taking care to go to the edges. Starting with a long edge of the rectangle, roll the dough up. Using a sharp serrated knife or dental floss, cut the rolled up dough in half. Cut each half in half again. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 10x 14 inch rectangle. Lightly brush the far edge with water. In a small bowl combine the cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkle over the rectangles. Then sprinkle the raisins and chopped nuts over the dough. Roll up the dough into a log and seal the seam. Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces; place the pieces in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan, or 12 inch deep dish pizza pan. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to rise overnight. The next morning, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Refrigerate or freeze no-yeast rolls in the same way as you would with yeast rolls. The main difference is no-yeast rolls don't require punching or rising before baking. If you try this, you should generally be prepared to de-gas and shape the dough after the long rise, doing your final rise right before baking. (Otherwise, an overproofed dough could collapse during baking.) If you're just adding an extra hour or something to the rise time, this is unlikely to cause problems. (Anytime is cinnamon roll time.)

A lance corporal is a Junior Enlisted at DoD paygrade E-3, with a starting monthly pay of $1,886. Marines generally receive a promotion to Lance Corporal after one or more years of service.

To make E-4 requires at least 12 months in the service and 8 months as an E-3. To make sergeant (E-5) requires at least 24 months in the service and 12 months as an E4-. Promotion to E-2 and E-3 generally comes more or less automatically so long as you do a competent job and stay out of trouble. To make E-2 you must have been in the service for at least 6 months. To make E-3 you must have been in the service for at least 9 months and in the E-2 grade for at least 8 months. Promotions to these ranks aren't competitive, meaning your promotion doesn't come at somebody else's expense. A Lance Corporal is most often promoted from Private First Class (PFC), although promotion from lower paygrades may occur with sufficient display of leadership and experience. If the Marine entered the Navy as an E-2, then they are all but guaranteed to promote to E-3 after nine months. While this will result in longer promotion waits for many lance corporals, it could have a benefit for corporals looking to make sergeant: Previously, they needed to have reached the 12-month mark at the start of the quarter in which they want to be promoted. Marine Corps sergeants have a pay grade of E-5, with the E standing for enlisted. To make sergeant you must climb through the lower ranks: Private (E-1), private first class (E-2), lance corporal (E-3) and corporal (E-4). A new change to Marine Corps policy will require some Marines to wait longer before they are eligible for promotion. The new guidelines stipulate that, as of April 1, Marine lance corporals and corporals must spend 12 months in their current rank before they can be looked at for promotion to corporal or sergeant.

The average lifespan of an air conditioner is anywhere from 8 to 15 years, but it’s hard to say exactly how long any given air conditioner unit will last. The Biggest Factors in Air Conditioner Lifespans Certain factors can influence how long your air conditioner survives, including the size of the air conditioner unit, your duct design, the amount of use and how much maintenance your unit receives. This allows you to control the flow of cooled air into each room of your home, keeping you more comfortable, and allowing your air conditioner to work more efficiently. Your central air conditioner is designed to last anywhere from 15 to 20 years. While there’s a good chance it may last far longer, especially if you’re meticulous about maintenance, there are still some very compelling reasons to replace it. Air Conditioner Use. Like anything else with moving parts, the more you use your air conditioner, the faster it’s going to break down. No matter how good the unit, the more it runs, the sooner it will need to be replaced. Heat pumps -- If you have an electric heat pump heating system, plan on replacing the exterior unit after about 16 years. Thermostats -- Expect your home's thermostat(s) to last about 35 years. Electric radiant heaters -- The most common of this type of room conditioner might be baseboard heaters. The impact of these items can be minor by themselves, but when several parts of the equation are out of whack, your air conditioner may have a very short life. How the different factors can affect your unit: Air Conditioner Size. The size of your air conditioner affects how efficiently it works, as well as how frequently it switches on and off. The Lifespan of a Central Air Conditioner. Per the United States Department of Energy, the average lifespan of a central air conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Some units may continue operating well beyond the 20-year mark, and others may need to be replaced before the 15 years has passed. How Long Does a Central Air Conditioner Last? Posted on February 8, 2017 by Glen Feurst Whether you’re buying a home with central air already installed or you’re thinking about replacing your elderly HVAC unit, it’s important to understand that a central air conditioner isn’t designed to last forever. Twenty years ago, the brand-new central air conditioner units that were available had an average SEER rating of about 12. Today, new systems have an average SEER rating that ranges from 16 to 18, which is far more efficient. The Biggest Factors in Air Conditioner Lifespans. Certain factors can influence how long your air conditioner survives, including the size of the air conditioner unit, your duct design, the amount of use and how much maintenance your unit receives. Ducting -- The NAHB estimates that the ductwork in your home should last about 10 years.

They are found in foods like milk, eggs and meat and also a wide variety of plants. This is part of why you can’t survive on a diet of just corn chips for very long. Essential amino acids were actually discovered in an experiment testing something very similar to a corn chip diet. Scientists fed rats a diet that had only corn protein in it and observed the results. 21 is all it takes. The human body uses just 21 amino acids to make all the proteins it needs to function and grow. Because amino acids can be arranged in many different combinations, it's possible for your body to make thousands of different kinds of proteins from just the same 21 amino acids. Just like a Lego house is made of bricks, proteins are made up of lots of tiny building blocks. These building blocks are called amino acids. To build a protein, first the amino acids are connected into long chains. These chains of amino acid building blocks can then fold into all types of shapes. Some chains fold into spirals. Amino acids are organic compounds containing amine and carboxyl functional groups, along with a side chain specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha-, beta-, gamma- or delta- a In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. show/hide words to know. 1  Amino acid: molecules that contain carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. 2  Enantiomer: one of a pair of molecules that are mirror images of each other, but not identical... 3  Essential: required, or necessary.

            "input": "A muscle strain (or pulled muscle) is an overstretched or torn muscle. Back strain is the most common cause of back pain, especially lower back pain. Muscle strain is often caused by overuse of a muscle or overloading a muscle. When a muscle is stressed beyond its limits, injury occurs. However, you risk a pull if you don’t warm up properly before you exercise and stretch a muscle past its limit, train longer than what your body can handle, or if you push a past muscle injury too far before the muscle has had adequate time to heal. You will know a muscle is pulled typically within 24 to 48 hours of the injury, as the area will become stiff, sore, you may experience loss of movement and muscle spasms, and bruising or swelling will often develop around the injured muscle. If you suffer a pulled muscle, here are ten ways to help speed the healing and soothe the pain and inflammation… 1. Ice. Icing a muscle strain as quickly as possible will do its part to reduce swelling and soothe pain. Ice applications can be administered in ice pack form or you can wrap ice cubes in a towel and cover the area frequently throughout the day for no more than 15-minutes each time. A grade-three injury is the most severe and also the least common type of strain injury. It refers to a complete tearing of a muscle or tendon, and it often occurs where the muscle is attached to the tendon above or below the joint. This kind of strain is accompanied by weakness, which means a person can no longer use that muscle. Cast immobilization and surgery are sometimes necessary. Due to the injury’s severity, recovery generally takes three to six months or longer. Back muscle strain is a common cause of lower back pain. Muscle strain can be caused by overuse of a muscle or overloading a muscle. A strain is a muscle or tendon injury; a sprain is a ligament injury. Relief from pain and inflammation from pulled back muscles / ligaments can be obtained by applying ice to the injury (wrap ice in cloth - do not apply ice directly to skin) for 15 to 20 minutes every 4 hours for two or three days. The cold helps reduce pain and inflammation and is also a distraction from the back pain. For a mild muscle strain, it takes around three to six weeks to recover with basic home care, according to an article by Healthline. Severe strains may take months to properly heal.... For a mild muscle strain, it takes around three to six weeks to recover with basic home care, according to an article by Healthline. Severe strains may take months to properly heal. Most people with a strained muscle usually experience full recovery with proper treatment, explains Pietrangelo. 10 Ways to Help Heal Pulled Muscles. A muscle pull (or strain) occurs when you twist, pull, or tear your muscle or tendon, the strong elastic cord that connects your muscle to the bone. As we age we are more susceptible to muscle pulls. The recovery time of muscle pull depends on the grade of muscle strain as described below: 1  Healing Time for Grade I Muscle Strain: This is minor condition, where only a small percentage of muscles are affected. This type of pulled muscle normalizes within a few weeks. Like back strain, back sprains may trigger back muscle spasms. Healing time depends on the severity of the sprain. Most back sprains heal in six to eight weeks but it can take several months for complete recovery from a severe back sprain. Ligaments take longer to heal than muscles. In most of the cases, how long will the muscle pull last depends on the location of the muscle and it also depends on the impact and severity of the injury. Under normal circumstances, symptoms of mild back muscle pull show improvement in about one to two weeks and show complete recovery in about 4 to 6 weeks. Moderate to mild pulled muscle in legs take about 8 to 10 weeks to heal completely. Symptoms of severe pulled muscle (usually grade III strain) persist until the tear in the muscle is surgically repaired. In some cases, the symptoms may persist even after the repair is done.

It appears that we — or at least our ancestors — were at least partially responsible for their extinction. About 45,000 years ago, Neanderthal numbers were dwindling. They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains, a new study suggests. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe.

Sign in or register to rate this publication. The terrestrial civilization has been established with only one human species, but it could have been otherwise. Until about 40,000 years ago, a blink in geologic time, at least one close relative was sharing this planet with us. They were Neanderthals, native Eurasians that today are recovering from their reputation as brutes thanks to scientific findings that have rediscovered them as a species similar to ours in many respects. Neanderthals were a separate species from modern humans, and became extinct (because of climate change or interaction with modern humans) and were replaced by modern humans moving into their habitat between 45,000 and 40,000 years ago.

Neanderthals (the ‘th’ pronounced as ‘t’) are our closest extinct human relative. Some defining features of their skulls include the large middle part of the face, angled cheek bones, and a huge nose for humidifying and warming cold, dry air. Their bodies were shorter and stockier than ours, another adaptation to living in cold environments. In particular, researchers have focused on the Neanderthals, a species very close in physique and brain size to modern humans. They once dominated Europe, but disappeared after modern humans emerged from our African homeland around 60,000 years ago. Recent studies also show that a few Neanderthals began mating with ancestors of modern humans long before the large out of Africa migration of the present day non-Africans, as early as 100,000 years ago.

Frequency, wavelength, cycles, period all refer to the pitch of the sound and where they sit on the frequency spectrum. 1  Short wavelength = high frequency = faster cycles = higher pitch. 2  Long wavelength = low frequency = slower cycles = lower pitch. Sounds are heard by the ear as either being loud or soft. The loudness of a sound in measured in decibels. Decibels refer to the energy produced by that sound. A human can hear sounds ranging from 0.1 decibels, which is very soft, to sound which measure 120 decibels. Younger people can often hear lower volumes better than older people. The perception of loudness is related to sound pressure level (SPL), frequency content and duration of a sound. [citation needed] The relationship between SPL and loudness of a single tone can be approximated by Stevens's power law in which SPL has an exponent of 0.67. It is sometimes stated that loudness is a subjective measure, often confused with physical measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. It is the length in space of a sound. The period of a sound wave is the time taken for one wavelength to pass a certain point before a new wave begins. A longer wave period represents a lower pitch sound. The third part of a sound wave is the amplitude. The amplitude of a sound wave represents the loudness of the sound. Look at the following pairs and decide which item has greater amplitude: 1  yell or whisper. 2  siren or cat meow. 3  mosquito buzz or car alarm. 4  fireworks or violin. has to do with the differences among sounds that have the same pitch and loudness The ear can respond to a remarkable range of sound amplitude. (Amplitude corresponds to the quality known as loudness.) The ratio between the threshold of pain and the threshold of sensation is on the order of 130 dB, or ten trillion to one. The judgment of relative sounds is more or less logarithmic, such that a tenfold increase in sound power is described as twice as loud. When the air particles begin vibrating the air inside your ear, you hear a sound. This chain reaction continues until the particles run out of energy. This is what you call a “sound wave.” Volume is the intensity of a sound wave. It is directly related to amplitude, which is the height of a sound wave.

The chemical peel is a procedure where a chemical solution is applied to the skin that makes the top layers of skin “blister” and peel away, revealing newer skin underneath. A chemical peel usually involves approximately 5 to 7 days for recovery time. The results may last for at least a year or more and with continued sun protection far longer. The results last depending upon how deeply the skin was treated. Continue to use 50-SPF sunscreen after each cleansing treatment. The face will be bright red for 7 to 10 days following a peel.

Quality dry aging makes the beef you buy not only more tender, but concentrates flavor and produces meat that is superb in taste and texture. Dry Aging occurs when beef is processed and stored in a 30 - 35 degree cooler. During this time, enzymes in the meat work to break down the fibers and tenderize the beef.

Holly, East Palatka The East Palatka Holly is an excellent urban tree with fleshy red berries that attract wildlife. East Palatka Hollies are popular in landscapes because of their uniformity and excellent performance under harsh urban conditions. Discovered in 1927 growing near East Palatka, Florida, this Holly is one of a group of hybrids between Ilex cassine x Ilex opaca . The broad, dull green, rounded leaves have one spine at the tip and few, if any, along the blade edge. The 30 to 45-foot-tall trees take on a moderately tight, pyramidal shape. A female Holly plant, East Palatka Holly is heavily laden with bright red berries in fall and winter, especially toward the top of the tree. A row of East Palatka Hollies will look quite uniform, adding to the popularity of the tree among landscape architects and designers. East Palatka holly grows 35 to 40 feet tall, according to the University of Florida, and is a hybrid of Ilex cassine -- the Dahoon holly -- and Ilex opaca, American holly. Both trees grow 1 to 3 feet per season. Both holly species take well to pruning and adapt well to life in containers or as bonsai. Ilex x attenuata‘East Palatka’. Figure 1. Middle-aged ‘East Palatka’ Holly. ‘East Palatka’ Holly1. Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2. INTRODUCTION. Discovered in 1927 growing near East Palatka, Florida, this Holly is one of a group of hybrids. between Ilex cassine x Ilex opaca (Fig. Training the tree into a single-trunked tree will increase its durability and resistance to storm-damage, although many nurseries offer multi-trunked specimens. The tree grows well even in small tree pits carved out of downtown sidewalks. East Palatka Holly grows quickly in full sun or partial shade on moist, acid soils. Growth is poor and foliage chlorotic on alkaline soil. Another hybrid, `Savannah', is a fast-growing female plant which also produces abundant red berries. The foliage is light green and variably-spined. Read Why Our Customers Bought... The Holly shrub, botanically known as Ilex, has a long connection with Christmas. Some of the first Christians decorated their homes with ‘Boughs of Holly’. Today, hollies are widely used as ornamental plants and have been developed for gardens. Hollies range in size from less than 1 foot, to plants over 70 feet tall. Query: how fast does a east palatka holly tree grow in shade",

In plants they use photosynthesis during the day and at night they use cellular respiration because there is no sun to produce the energy needed with photosynthesis. In animals they only use cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the conversion process that is initiated in the cytoplasm and finishes in the mitochondria, with the end product being carbon dioxide molecules. The cellular system is like a furnace burning energy, and the byproduct of that combustion is carbon dioxide. Cellular Respiration in Plants By Robert Korpella; Updated April 25, 2017 Cells in both plants and animals use cellular respiration as a means of converting stored energy into a chemical that individual cells consume. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a chemical food that all cells use. Plants first create a simple sugar through photosynthesis. Individual cells then break down that sugar through cellular respiration. Plants and animals breathe, but animals, including humans, require plants to convert the energy of the sun into oxygen. Animal life receives oxygen molecules, and—after a process called internal respiration and cellular respiration takes place inside the animal or human body—exudes carbon dioxide molecules. Does cellular respiration occur in plants and animals? Cellular respiration occurs in both plants and animals. The general equation for this is; glucose + oxygen --> Carbon dioxide + Water When oxygen is not available anaerobic r … espiration takes place, which is different for both plants and animals. Plants and animals are the two primary systems in the biosphere's cycle of life, with plants exhaling oxygen through photosynthesis and animals inhaling oxygen through the lungs and exhaling carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Plants require carbon dioxide to live and flourish with their end-product again becoming oxygen. Cellular respiration occurs in both plants and animals. The general equation for this is; glucose + oxygen --> Carbon dioxide + Water When oxygen is not available anaerobic r…espiration takes place, which is different for both plants and animals. External Respiration. External respiration is the process wherein animal life receives air from the environment and in a gaseous exchange returns the air to the environment in another form. This gaseous exchange takes place in all life forms, from insects to fish to human beings to plants, including algae and fungus. The first steps in cellular respiration reactions are called glycosis, and they take place in the absence of oxygen. This process occurs in the cell’s cytoplasm, which is a gel material contained inside the plant’s individual cells. The plant uses glucose as the energy source to carry on all its metabolic functions. It is at the cellular level that everything changes. Overall Chemical Reactions. Chemically, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are total opposites, even though both must occur for plant survival. Query: how is cellular respiration used in plants and animals",

Canadian travelers who plan to drive when they are outside North America can get an International Driving Permit (IDP) before they leave Canada. The IDP is used in conjunction with your provincial driver's license. Planning to rent a car and venturing out into the world on your own? Plan to obtain an International Driving Permit before you go. Why Carry an IDP? Your IDP is a valid form of identification in 150 countries worldwide and contains your name, photo and driver information. It translates your identification information into 10 languages — so it speaks the language even if you don't. Most countries highly recommend an International Driving Permit. Another country cannot issue an IDP to be used in conjunction with a US driver’s license. An IDP accompaning a US driver’s license can only be issued in the USA. The International Driving Permit (IDP), often (and incorrectly) referred to as International Driving License, is a document that, along with your valid home driver's license, allows you to legally drive a motor vehicle while abroad.

Lolong was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records at 6.17 meters (20.25 feet). Since a 100-year-old crocodile should be nearly toothless (according to the documentary), he was estimated to be probably no older than 60, and likely, still growing. Gustave is also known for the three bullet scars on his body. Get ready for some nightmares. The world's largest crocodile is a monster of a reptile. Named Cassius, this nearly 18-foot-long (5.48 meters) Australian saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) was crowned the world's largest captive croc by Guinness World Records on Jan. 1, 2011. The animal lives at Marineland Melanesia on Green Island, off the coast of Cairns in Queensland. The largest crocodile in the world was a stunning best more than 20 feet long, the biggest known.

Since man ruled the world, 17 out of the 23 species of crocodilians are now endangered. Since Gustave has not been captured, his exact length and weight is unknown, but in 2002 it was stated that he could be easily more than 18 feet (5.5 m) long, and weigh more than 2,000 pounds (900 kg). Some estimates have put Gustave at 25 feet (7.5 m) or more in length. The documentary film also stated that since crocodiles can go several months without eating, Gustave could afford to select his prey carefully. In parts of Asia and Australia saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) of 6 metres (20 ft) long are occasionally reported.

Observations about human extinction. Milankovitch cycles describe the way that the earth moves and how the climatic changes vary depending on where the earth is in space. The orbital shape of the earth causes changes every 100,000 years. The axial tilt of the earth wobbles and alters the climate every 41 thousand years. A notable example is Mir, which hosted several long-duration missions of a year or more — including the longest single spaceflight duration of any human to date, 437 days, by Valeri Polyakov in 1994-95.

If you define “human” as our own species, H. sapiens, then about 180,000 to 200,000 years ago. If you define “human” as the entire genus Homo, then about 2.0 - 2.5 million years ago. If you define “human” as the entire hominid line from the divergence with the Chimpanzee line, then about 6.0–7.0 million years ago. The Universe is 13.7B years old. The Earth has not existed since the moment the Universe was created and is about 4.5B years old and is made out the debris of two previous generation of stars. Life on Earth started shortly after the temperatures cooled down, about 3.7B years ago. Up until 600M years ago, life was predominantly single-celled organisms. From 600M years until now, the variety of life that we see evolved. Humans started to separate from the rest of the great apes about 7M years ago and we became modern humans 200k years ago. Even though evolution is taking place all around us, for many species the process operates so slowly that it is not observable except over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years -- much too long to witness in a human lifetime. Humans will NOT survive another 1,000 years on Earth, says Stephen Hawking: Physicist warns we must 'escape beyond our fragile planet'.

What Are Eustachian Tubes? According to WebMD, “The Eustachian tubes connect the middle ears to the back of the throat. The tubes help the ears drain fluid. They also keep air pressure in the ears at the right level. When you swallow or yawn, the tubes open briefly to let air in to make the pressure in the middle ears equal to the pressure outside of the ears. Sometimes fluid or negative pressure gets stuck in the middle ear. The pressure outside the ear gets too high. This causes ear pain and sometimes trouble hearing,” resulting in something known as Eustachian Tube Dysfunction. Eustachian tube dysfunction happens when the tube between the middle ear and the back of the nose (the Eustachian tube) doesn't work properly. This means that the pressure in your ear can't go back to normal. The result is muffled hearing and a popping or crackling noise in one or both ears. But it is important to note that these other symptoms happen alongside muffled hearing. Eustachian tube dysfunction does not cause dizziness or tinnitus alone. One or both ears may be affected. Symptoms can last from a few hours to several weeks or more. It depends on the cause.

Evaporation and transpiration losses from farming and the watering of lawns and landscapes. 2  2. Evaporation losses from canals and artificial lakes including the reservoirs behind dams. The absorption of most of the outgoing thermal radiation by water vapor creates most of Earth's natural greenhouse effect - an effect that is now being increased by human pollution. Without the atmospheric water vapor Earth's surface would be, on average, about 31°C (55°F) colder than it is now and the differences in temperature between high and low altitudes and between the poles and equator would be smaller. Climate change intensifies this cycle because as air temperatures increase, more water evaporates into the air. Warmer air can hold more water vapor, which can lead to more intense rainstorms, causing major problems like extreme flooding in coastal communities around the world. <<Related: A Thirst for Power: The Water Energy Nexus>> Water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, yet other greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) are often portrayed as the main drivers of climate change.

Water vapor is another greenhouse gas that keeps heat from the sun trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere and helps maintain a temperature at which life can flourish on our planet. However, deforestation also affects the amount of this in the air. Air is a mixture of gases, which includes nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor (water in its gas form). Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor in air. All air contains at least some water vapor, but the amount of water vapor changes a lot from place to place and from time to time.

            "input": "More accurate dating at Neanderthal sites in recent years has generally pushed back the 30,000-year date for Neanderthal extinction, says paleontologist Katerina Harvati of Germany's University of Tuebingen, making the new study results look more reasonable. Shanidar Cave, which dates to sixty to eighty thousand years ago, is a Neanderthal site in modern-day Iraq. The excavations of this site are important when considering the question of whether Neanderthals buried their dead12. Skhul Cave, in Israel, is a site that was inhabited by AMH during the Middle Pleistocene6. The result is that mtDNA is passed on only along the maternal line. This means that all of the mtDNA in the cells of a person's body are copies of his or her mother's mtDNA, and all of the mother's mtDNA is a copy of her mother's, and so on. No matter how far back you go, mtDNA is always inherited only from the mother. If you went back six generations in your own family tree, you'd see that your nuclear DNA is inherited from 32 men and 32 women. Your mtDNA, on the other hand, would have come from only one of those 32 women. Moreover, the researchers determined that the common ancestor to Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens lived as long as 500,000 years ago, well before the most recent common mtDNA ancestor of modern humans. This suggests (though it does not prove) that Neanderthals went extinct without contributing to the gene pool of any modern humans. Final note The Neanderthal genes that turn up in people today are from this older era, after the two species were in contact but well before Neanderthal extinction. The intermingling seen in the new study took place after that early interbreeding era, Higham says. Although we know far more about Neanderthals than we did when they were first discovered (or even fifty years ago),just as many questions remain. As the body of research on the subject of Neanderthals grows, however, the picture will only get clearer. Shanidar Cave, which dates to sixty to eighty thousand years ago, is a Neanderthal site in modern-day Iraq. The excavations of this site are important when considering the question of whether Neanderthals buried their dead 12. New fossil dates show our ancient cousins disappeared 40,000 years ago. View Images A Neanderthal jawbone from Spain was among those dated for a new study that pushes back the date for the Neanderthals' demise. Photograph by Thomas Higham, University of Oxford PUBLISHED August 20, 2014 This, in fact, has been done, with mtDNA from the bones of Neanderthals. Comparing mtDNA of these Neanderthals to mtDNA of living people from various continents, researchers have found that the Neanderthals' mtDNA is not more closely related to that of people from any one continent over another. Here is a series of short summaries of some of the more important Neanderthal sites, some of which have already been discussed in this section. 1  Atapuerca is a large site in Spain with several different areas.

            "input": "Function. The Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger does not bind very tightly to Ca 2+ (has a low affinity), but it can transport the ions rapidly (has a high capacity), transporting up to five thousand Ca 2+ ions per second. Active transport requires chemical energy because it is the movement of biochemicals from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration. Passive transport moves biochemicals from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration; so it does not require energy. What functions do carrier proteins perform in active transport? Carrier proteins allow molecule to bind to them; they change their shape to transport material across the cell membrane. The sodium-potassium pump is integral in maintaining the acid-base balance as well as in healthy kidney function. Energy is derived from pumping sodium outside the cell, where it becomes concentrated, wanting to push its way back in. This energy is used to remove acid from the body. The sodium-potassium pump also functions to maintain the electrical charge within the cell. This is particularly important to muscle and nerve cells. During nerve transmission and muscle contraction, potassium exits the cell and sodium enters, resulting in a change in electrical charge that causes a nerve impulse or muscle contraction. A: The sodium-potassium pump is an essential cellular membrane protein that functions by pumping out three sodium ions and taking in two potassium ions. This mechanism preserves the electrochemical gradient formed from the varying concentrations of sodium and potassium ions within the cell and its exterior. Continue Reading When an enzyme in the pump, called sodium-potassium-ATPase, splits the phosphate from the ADP, the energy released powers the transport action of the pump. Passive transport: membrane channels. The sodium-potassium pump sets the membrane potential of the neuron by keeping the concentrations of Na + and K + at constant Sodium-potassium pump is pivotal to body's function. The story of the sodium-potassium pump has strong ties to Denmark. In 1997, the Danish scientist Jens Chr. Skou received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery, and over the years, research on the pump has remained a strong focus area at Aarhus University. Listed below are several cellular and pharmaceutical conditions in which this happens. 1  The internal [Na+] is higher than usual (like it is when digitalis glycoside medications block the Na+/K+ -ATPase pump.) 2  The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum release of Ca2+ is inhibited. 3  Other Ca2+ influx channels are inhibited. The sodium-potassium pump uses active transport to move molecules from a high concentration to a low concentration. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions out of and potassium ions into the cell. This pump is powered by ATP. For each ATP that is broken down, 3 sodium ions move out and 2 potassium ions move in. In more detail: Sodium ions bind to the pump and a phosphate group from ATP attaches to the pump, causing it to change its shape. In this new shape, the pump releases the three sodium ions and now binds two potassium ions. Once the potassium ions are bound to the pump, the phosphate group detaches. The sodium-potassium pump is a P-type ATPase sharing similarities with other P-type ATPases, notably the calcium-ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the hydrogen-potassium ATPase in gastric cells (2). Quick Answer. The sodium-potassium pump is an essential cellular membrane protein that functions by pumping out three sodium ions and taking in two potassium ions. This mechanism preserves the electrochemical gradient formed from the varying concentrations of sodium and potassium ions within the cell and its exterior.

Woman adheres to a diet. Pregnancy after miscarriage: What you need to know. Pregnancy after miscarriage can be stressful and confusing. When is the best time to get pregnant? What are the odds of miscarrying again? Get the facts about pregnancy after miscarriage. By Mayo Clinic Staff 120 comments. 1  I had an abortion two weeks ago. I don’t have any symptoms of pregnancy. 2  Thanks a lot, because yesterday I went again for the ultra sound of which they said the scan shows no pregnancy and the doctor put in the fingers inside my vagina, she said the cervix is closed I have no blood so she doesn’t see any pregnancy. In some cases, the hCG levels can return to the normal level within just a few days after a miscarriage. In some other cases, the hCG levels may take a few weeks to return to the normal level after a miscarriage. Here are a few things that will help you understand the changes better: Not true all the time. I had a miscarriage, and 2 weeks later ovulated and became pregnant. I read that your HCG levels have to go back down to 0 for you to even ovulate. The doctors thought I was pregnant due to remnants too, but had my blood taken and at 3 weeks pregnant, they were over 250. positive pregnancy tests after miscarriage. I think I know the answers to this really but I need a bit of hand-holding. Last week I was 6 weeks pregnant but then had a lot of bleeding and pain. GP said miscarriage, and that I should do another pregnancy test this week to confirm. I asked him what to do if it was positive, and he said 'well I really think it will be negative'. Well, it was a strong positive. If you have stopped bleeding chances are your hcg level is returning to normal. If you had normal periods before, you could probably expect to ovulate 2 - 3 weeks after the miscarriage, and a period about 5 weeks after. Good luck! The bleeding slowed and then came back heavy again. After bleeding for two weeks straight, it lightened. Now I think it is finally over. I took another P.T. tonight to see if the HCG was finally out. It was faintly positive...so i will have to wait a bit longer. How the miscarriage occurred, such as spontaneous miscarriage or medical procedure, can also affect how fast hCG levels decrease. In general, hCG levels return to normal by 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage, but they may occur sooner during the very early stages of pregnancy. Placental Causes of High hCG After a miscarriage, hCG levels can sometimes remain elevated. It depends: How long for hcg to go down depends on how high it was and whether the miscarriage is complete or not. Pregnancy test is not a good way to know, since it can remain positive for many weeks after a miscarriage. ...Read more Query: how long is hcg positive after miscarriage",

            "input": "Storing natural peanut butter in the fridge means a rock-hard product, but many natural peanut butters instruct us to refrigerate on the label. What’s the deal? Here’s the short answer: no, you don’t have to refrigerate. Natural peanut butter keeps just fine in a cool, dark place like the pantry for at least a month ― which is more than enough time for many peanut butter lovers to consume it. But if you don’t eat this nutty spread that quickly, the fridge will keep it fresher longer. If you do refrigerate your natural peanut butter, be sure to stir it before doing so ― once it’s cold, it can be hard to stir the oil back into the peanut butter. But once that’s done, a jar will easily keep in the fridge for six months. Do not purchase bulging cans, says USDA. But what about our favorite foods—peanut butter, peanuts and peanut products? Peanut butter’s shelf life may depend on the way you store it. Follow the guide above and remember to store peanuts in airtight containers. An open jar of peanut butter stays fresh up to three months in the pantry. After that, it’s recommended to store the peanut butter in the fridge (where it can maintain its quality for another 3-4 months). If you don’t refrigerate, oil separation can occur. Here’s a run-down. Refrigerated peanut butter won’t spread that easily, but it prevents oil separation and helps retain the flavor. Image used under Creative Commons from Bobbi Bowers If you’re making peanut butter yourself and you’re not using any stabilizers or hydrogenated fat, your peanut butter should last a few months, possibly half a year. Because you’re not using any stabilizers, it’s quite natural that oil will separate – that’s not harmful to the sandwich spread, you can just stir contents of the jar and you’re ready to use it. Peanut Butter, unopened 6-9 months Refrigeration not needed. Peanut Butter, opened 2-3 months Lasts 6 -9 months in refrigerator. Peanuts: Bagged, in the shell or out 1-2 months Lasts 4-6 months in refrigerator. Peanuts: in cans or jars, unopened 2 years. Peanut Flour, unopened 1 year. The all natural peanut butter does not have sugar or hydrogenated oil in it. Therefore the fat will come to the top and you have to stir it. If you refrigerate it, it will stay mixed longer and you don’t have to stir it. I’ve been doing this for about 50 years now. The answer probably depends on how long it takes you to consume the peanut butter once you have opened it. In our household we never refrigerate our peanut butter. (It is most often from Trader Joe's, with the only ingredient listed being dry roasted peanuts.) An open jar of peanut butter in our household typically gets consumed within 6 weeks' time, and we have never had any problems with the peanut butter going bad. Yes, if you don't refrigerate your peanut butter, it will go rancid more quickly than if you had refrigerated it. But it will likely take a number of weeks or possibly a couple of months before that occurs. I suspect that peanut butter made with raw peanuts rather than roasted ones spoils more quickly. Refrigerated peanut butter won’t spread that easily, but it prevents oil separation and helps retain the flavor. Image used under Creative Commons from Bobbi Bowers.

Remove the pork chops once the temperature reaches at least 150 degree and let the meat rest for three to five minutes before serving. Ingredients: 1  4 center cut. 2  bone-in pork chops. 3  ¼ cup kosher salt. 4  4 cups water. 5  Salt and pepper to taste. 6  Glaze or marinade (optional) Pork chops do not come in a standard size. It is the thickness, not the weight, that makes the difference when grilling. For a half-inch-thick pork chop, it will take about five to seven minutes on direct high heat. High heat is around 450 degrees Fahrenheit on the grill. A three-quarters-inch thick pork chop will take around six to eight minutes on high heat. A 1-inch pork chop will cook in about eight to 10 minutes on direct medium heat. Medium heat on a grill is between 350 and 450 degrees. For a pork chop that is 1¼ to 1½ inches thick, sear each side for a total of six minutes on high heat, then finish grilling over medium heat for another four to six minutes. For sugar-based glazes, apply it about 10 minutes prior to removing the pork chops from the grill to prevent the glaze from burning onto the chops. Apply the glaze to one side of the chops, close the lid for five minutes to let it bake on, then open the lid, turn the chops, and repeat the process. 7. Check for doneness. Using a digital meat thermometer, insert the tip into the thickest part of the pork chop, but not touching the bone. For grilling pork chops, you want to set up a two-zone, medium-hot fire. Fire up a full chimney of Kingsford ® Charcoal, or light a pile of about 100 briquets. With its higher top temperature and consistent burn, Kingsford Professional is perfect for chops. How do you cook pork chops on a griddle, and for how long should I cook them? How long should a pork chop cook in the oven? How long do pork chops take to bake in the oven at 400 degrees? To avoid drying the chops while grilling, either marinate or brine them (use a basic brine solution of 1/4 cup salt to four cups of water; lay the pork chops in a single layer in a shallow dish and pour the brine over the top) for two hours in the refrigerator. Sear the chops using high heat. Place the pork chops on the hottest part of the grate, directly above the coals. Sear all the chops for about three minutes per side, turning only once, until they develop a brown crust. If the grill flares up, temporarily move the chops away from the coals until the flames die down. You’ll never grill another chewy, dry pork chop if you follow this simple seven-step method using Kingsford® Charcoal. 1  1. Fire up the grill. 2  2. Prep the pork chops. 3  3.

Flag In the 6th Century the Franks drove the Visigoths out of France and the Byzantines siezed control of the southern coastal strip of Spain. The Visigoths moved their capital first to Barcelona and finally to Toledo where they became more powerful and during the reign of King Leovigild, were able to conquer the Suevi. In 587 A.D. King Leovigild's son Reccared converted from Arianism to Catholicism, as did the other Visigoth Nobles, thus creating religious unity between the ruling Visigoths, the church and the Hispano- Roman population. Spain Becomes Part of the Visigoth Empire. During the 4th Century A.D. the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by Germanic tribes ( Suevi, Vandals and Alans ).The Roman Empire was in decline and by the start of the 5th Century they had lost all but Tarraconensis ( Tarragona). This time the gates were opened by slaves and the Visigoths went in a looted the city, damaging buildings and ransacking the tombs of previous Emperors. Rome had not been sacked in 800 years but the Visigoths managed to sack the city before continuing their rampage to further south in Italy. This Visigoth victory came at a huge price with the Visigoths losing 17,000 casualties and losses out of their 39,000 men while the Romans had 15,000 casualties and losses out of 18,000 men. The domination of the Visigoths over modern day Spanish territory i estimated to be between 14 and 256 years. On the 24th august in the year 410, as the Roman Empire waned in strength the Visigoths attacked Rome. This move can be seen as one of the last of a long line of manoeuvres that signalled the end of the behemoth Roman Empire. They were married in 1469. Each ruled their own kingdom(s) and co-ruled their spouse' kingdom…. Both were deceased by 1516. Spain did not come into being until their Grandson Carlos I of Spain, also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, inherited the 3 kingdoms in 1516. Isabela I and Ferdinand II never ruled Spain. In order to try and regain control of Hispania the Romans made a pact with the Visigoths who in 415 A.D. drove the Alans and Vandals out of the central part of the peninsula. By the latter part of the 5th Century, having achieved independence from the Romans, the Visigoth kingdom of Tolosa ( with its capital in Toulouse) controlled the southwest of France and most of the Iberian Peninsula. From 395 the Visigoths were under the rule of Alaric I and by the turn of the year 408 the Visigoths moved westward and invaded Italy, this accumulated in the siege of Rome starting in the same year. Visigoths Sack of Rome. In 408 the first siege of Rome started as the Visigoths besieged the city. This first siege was a resounding victory to the Visigoths as disease and starvation swept through the city, this victory did not come in taking the city however. How long did Muslims rule continue in Spain? The Muslim armies began their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 AD. They were finally conquered in 1492 AD when they lost Grenada.

The pressure and heat at this depth is critical to the formation of the diamonds th…at are mined at the surface today. At crustal pressures, the stable form of carbon is the allotrope graphite. Diamonds can form in most of Earth's interior but not near its surface, where graphite is the stable form of carbon. Indeed, diamonds only survive at Earth's surface because great heat is required to break down the diamond structure. Diamond is not formed from metamorphosed coal, and most diamonds discovered on the surface in mining operations are at least one billion years old; some may be two or three times that age. Diamond can also be formed from the pressures of high speed impacts of meteors with the Earth, but these are more of scientific interest, having no economic usefulness due to their small size and dispersion.

We’ll sift through thousands of diamonds online and send you suggested stones to choose from that fit your needs the best. Experiments and the high density of diamonds tell us that they crystallize at very high pressures. In nature this means that diamonds are created by geologic processes at great depth within Earth, generally more than 150 kilometers down, in a region beneath the crust known as the mantle. Other processes, explored later in this exhibition, bring diamonds to where people can find them. How are diamonds formed and where are they mined?

A: Painting with an airless will usually get more paint on the surface than with a brush. If applied properly - keeping the gun 12 away from the surface at a 90° angle and applying the recommended mil thickness of paint - airless spraying is the most efficient way to paint most large exterior surfaces. A: If you need to paint outside with latex paint when temperatures are moving up and down like a yo-yo, I suggest you use one of the latex like Duration, Resilience, or SuperPaint. These products can be applied and will cure at lower temperatures, as low as 35° F. Traditional latex-based paints need temperatures above 60° F to cure properly. Warmer temperatures are needed to allow the latex particles to coalesce, or melt together. The curing time of paint is dependent on a variety of factors, such as: climate, number of coats, type of paint, etc. The greatest determinant is which type of paint you use. Most paints will include the on the label how many hours it takes that paint to dry to the touch. Depending on the ventilation, oil-based paint takes about twelve hours to dry to the touch. Latex paint will feel dry in as few as three hours. However, the full curing time takes much longer. Oil-based Paints. As oil-based paint cures, the thinner evaporates and the oils seep into the pores of the surface leaving behind the binder and the pigment. If you're painting big surfaces, cut in with a brush and roll the rest of the panel. For most siding areas, if you can't spray and backbrush, stick with a brush. Most siding areas are not wide enough to use a roller, so a good 4 brush that holds a lot of paint will work much better.

Some people say it's okay to paint all day, even if the temperature is above the minimum recommendation for only an hour or so. A: Ideally, the temperature should be in the suggested range and above the dew point for at least 48 hours after application. Paint will cure to the touch and minor handling in 24 hrs or less.

These studies are of interest to me because I have been under treatment for the past two years for gingivitis, or inflammatory gum disease. Cranial nerves connect your sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, mouth) to your brain; Central nerves connect areas within the brain and spinal cord; Peripheral nerves connect the spinal cord with your limbs; Autonomic nerves connect the brain and spinal cord with your organs (heart, stomach, intestines, blood vessels, etc.) The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, including cranial and central nerves. In another study, New York University dental researchers studied people from 50-70 years of age, and were able to link inflamed gums to a greatly increased risk of cognitive impairment. It seems that the pathogens connected with inflamed gums can generate inflammation in the brain cells, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. There are numerous thoughts on the causes of dementia, but staying on top of dental problems is one of the easiest ways to lower your chances of developing this devastating diagnosis.

The purpose of the lessons in this unit is to help Ohio students in grades 5-7 learn the characteristics of the literary text MOOD and SETTING indicators that they must master for their respective Ohio achievement tests. Definition of Mood. As a literary device, mood is the emotional feeling or atmosphere that a work of literature produces in a reader. All works of literature produce some sort of emotional and psychological effect in the audience; though every reader may respond differently to the same work of literature there is often a similar type of mood produced. Some of the best examples of this are below. 1  Frozen as a horror film: 2  Mary Poppins as a horror film: Video Player. 3  Dumb and Dumber was turned into a horror film, Lurk and Lurker: Video Player. 4  The Shining was transformed from horror film into a feel-good romantic comedy: Video Player. Whatever tone, mood, and style you decide on for your stories, realize that those elements contribute to the story’s feel. _____ Recognize that even if you don’t purposely create tone and mood, they are still created for your stories and scenes. They may be muddled and the cause of weak responses to your fiction, but they’re there, in the story. Make a point to purposely work tone and mood to the story’s advantage by your style choices. Mood is the emotions that you (the reader) feel while you are reading. Some literature makes you feel sad, others joyful, still others, angry. The main purpose for some poems is to set a mood. Writers use many devices to create mood, including images, dialogue, setting, and plot. Often a writer creates a mood at the beginning of the story and continues it to the end. However, sometimes the mood changes because of the plot or changes in characters. Summary: Mood Literary Definition. Define mood in literature: The definition of mood in literature is the overall feeling and author creates for his audience. Mood is the atmosphere the text creates. In a way, it’s all of the “unsaid” elements that create a feeling the text provides for the audience. Mood is essential to engage readers. Let us see how writers use the afore-mentioned elements in their literary works to create a particular mood. Creating Mood through Setting Setting is the physical location in a piece of literature that provides background in which the events of the narrative take place. A particular setting not only provides support to the contents of the story, but also sets the mood of the readers. Let us analyze a few examples of mood developed using a setting: Mood (literature) In literature, mood is the atmosphere of the narrative. Mood is created by means of setting (locale and surroundings in which the narrative takes place), attitude (of the narrator and of the characters in the narrative), and descriptions. Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree. Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story. For example, during the Great Depression, the mood in the USA was somber. People lost their jobs, went hungry and experienced a wide range of emotions. Words such as frightened, panicked and depressed are commonly used to describe people's moods during this time. Moods in Literature In literature, mood is the feeling created in the reader. This feeling is the result of both the tone and atmosphere of the story. The author's attitude or approach to a character or situation is the tone of a story. The tone sets the mood of the story. Atmosphere is the feeling created by mood and tone. The atmosphere takes the reader to where the story is happening and lets them experience it much like the characters. Some common moods found in literature include: Style, tone, and mood combine to make your stories your own, something no one else could create. And if you changed the tone or mood of multiple scenes or of a story as a whole, you’d create a new story quite unlike the original. Query: how is mood created in literature",

Doing so turns the bottle into a comfort item, may hinder two-handed development, and can lead to dental cavities. Offer the cup first, then the bottle. And it ends when the child no longer breastfeeds or takes a bottle. This process may last several weeks, a few months, or more than a year. Your baby may begin eating solid foods at about 6 months of age. At this point, you may want to offer cup-feeding to supplement breast- or bottle-feedings. How long does engorgement last? Fortunately, engorgement passes pretty quickly for most women. You can expect it to ease up in 24 to 48 hours if you're nursing well or pumping at least every two to three hours. If not treated, engorgement can take up to ten days to start to go away. Once the engorgement passes, your breasts will be softer, although still full of milk. If you're not nursing, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged: 1  Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. (Your labor and delivery team should be able to help you with this.) 2  Nurse frequently – between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. The pain and discomfort from breast engorgement improve as your breasts stop making milk. You will likely feel better in 1 to 5 days. Home treatment, such as applying cold packs to the breasts, may relieve some of your symptoms. Don't worry -- the kind of fullness you feel in the beginning doesn't last, and your body is still making plenty of milk even if it doesn't feel that way. 7 Means of Relief It should only last for the first week or so, but engorgement can be painful for some women. Weaning is a gradual process. It starts when you begin giving solid food to your baby and ends when the child no longer breast - feeds or takes a bottle. This process may last a few months or more than a year.A rough outline of this process is as follows: Your baby begins eating solid foods at 4 to 6 months of age. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged: 1  Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. 2  Nurse frequently – between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. 3  Let your baby finish nursing on one breast before switching to other. Here's how you can make breastfeeding more comfortable and ease engorgement: 1  Just before nursing, place a warm compress on your breasts for a few minutes to get the milk flowing. 2  Nurse frequently, with no more than two to three hours between feedings. 3  While your baby is nursing, gently massage the breast he's on. Engorged breasts take place, because of the pressure of expanding cells, due to the new breast milk contained inside of them. Engorgement happens when the milk producing cells, are uncomfortably full. Engorgement is sometimes apparent in the areola and/or the breast; in one breast or in both breasts. (you may have just one engorged, sore swollen breast) Dealing with engorgement on top of having a new baby to care for, day and night, may be discouraging to a mother. The good news is, there are ways to treat breast engorgement. How Long does Engorgement Last? Nursing engorgement is temporary and usually only lasts three days, or until the mother's body has adapted to the needs of her baby. Breastfeeding and engorgement can also happen as a result of missed feeds or incorrect latching, which results in milk being left behind in the breast. Query: how long does engorgement last",

                "Fortunately, engorgement passes pretty quickly for most women. You can expect it to ease up in 24 to 48 hours if you're nursing well or pumping at least every two to three hours. If not treated, engorgement can take up to ten days to start to go away."

Divide the depreciation amount by number of months in your lease. This will be your base payment. $6,890/36 = $191.39: 12. Add the adjusted capitalized cost and the residual value. Take the sum and multiply it by money factor. This is your monthly rent charge. ($20,000 + $13,110) x 0.00125 = $41.39: 13. Add the rent charge to your base payment to get your pretax lease payment $191.39 + $41.39 = $232.78: 14. This car will have a residual value of 57 percent and a money factor of 0.00125. We will have a $1,700 down payment and the car will have a $500 rebate. Assume we've negotiated a sale price of $21,000 (before the rebate was applied) and will have $1,200 in various fees. For this example, we will not have a trade-in. By definition, a lease refers to the contractual agreement or contract itself, while rent is the periodic payment for the use of an asset. Residual Value. Residual value, sometimes called salvage value, is an estimate of how much an asset will be worth at the end of its lease. As an example, a car worth $20,000 being leased for 3 years can have a residual value of $10,000 when the lease ends. For most assets, the longer the lease period, the lower the residual value. Residual value is also often used to refer to the value of an asset after depreciation. For more information or to do calculations involving depreciation, use the Depreciation Calculator. Calculating Lease Payment. Bimmer America gives you the most efficient and accurate BMW lease calculator formula on the web. We take into account MSPR, Sale Price, Net Capitalized Cost, Residual Value, BMW Incentives, Depreciation, Money Factor, Terms, Finance Charge, and offers through BMW financial. We also provide a convenient auto lease calculator (payment calculator), and CULA program policies, forms and documents. Can't find the residual you are looking for? If you do not find your residual here, it means that CULA does not have it yet. The car lease residual value is the dollar amount that you can purchase the vehicle for at the end of the lease. When a lease ends, you can either return the vehicle to the dealership or you can purchase it for a set amount. This amount is referred to as the residual value. The whole reason you got that zero-down (or low-money-down) rate and sweet monthly payment plan was because of the car's high residual value, which in theory would allow the dealer to get that dough back out of the car by selling it through his CPO program after your lease ended. The depreciation fee portion of your payment simply pays the leasing company for the loss in value of its car, spread over the lease term (number of months), based on the miles you intend to drive and the time you intend to keep the car. You pay off an equal portion of the total expected depreciation each month. Query: how is the residual value calculated on a lease?",

Dehydration is a way of food upkeep, where moisture is usually taken off the food. Recipes ​In a food dehydrator, the combination of heat, as well as the movement of air, is used to dry foods. A regular food dehydrator comprises of shelves which have open segments that allow circulation of heat and air along with a hygienic manner of handling and shielding the food. Modern methods use electricity to power an appliance that resembles a small crockpot. Dehydrators will include several trays where food can be stored and dried at the same time. The separation ensures that none of the flavors mix during the process. Removable and stackable trays as well as shelving may be present. Circular drying racks may even rotate to allow for proper dehydration at all times. Dehydrators operate by using of a heating element, fan, air vents, and food trays. The heating element, fan and vents work together to circulate air and remove moisture. Heating the food allows for moisture to be released from the food and into the dehydrator.

The advantage to buying or making a solar dehydrator is the savings on electricity. You use sun power to dry the food. The problem with solar dehydrators is nature is unpredictable. If there's no sun, you won't be able to use the food dryer. Also, sun dryers rely on sunlight for heat to pull water. Don’t work well with high-fat foods: Because dehydrators simply remove moisture, you can’t dry high-fat food like avocado and have the results be shelf-stable.

How does kratom stay in your system? - Answered by a verified Drug Testing Expert They are bluffing about randomly testing for it. But if he gets a random false positive for opiates, which happens more than you think, and he denies doing opiates then they will probably send it off for kratom. But kratom won't stay in your system longer than 30 hours tops, it has a short half life of around 3 hours. But if his drug court is anything like mine (I mean my friends) then they will arrest him just for doing kratom, because it's a prohibited substance on that program. The fastest elimination of the kratom alkaloids is 7 hours which means that is going to be there in the system for 1.64 days. In contrast, the slowest elimination half life was found to be 39.91 which means that the drug is cleared form the system in 9 days.

As a result, the plants receive water. Insurance of the structure and its contents against flooding can reduce the impacts of floods on individuals or companies. Floods have significant consequences for the environment In many natural systems, floods play an important role in maintaining key ecosystem functions and biodiversity. The problems start when flooding occurs in areas of large-scale human development of the landscape. In areas largely inhabited by people, there are both positive and negative environmental effects of flooding.

            "input": "There are two types of vaccine that protect against polio: inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). IPV is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on the patient's age. Polio vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Most people should get polio vaccine when they are children. Children get 4 doses of IPV at these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and a booster dose at 4-6 years. OPV has not been used in the United States since 2000 but is still used in many parts of the world. 1  What Everyone Should Know Basic information for people interested in the vaccine... (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/public/index.html) These antibodies protect you from illness should you become infected with the polio virus. The vaccine is safe to be given if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Before 2004, the polio vaccine was given as drops into the mouth. It is now always given as an injection. If you have previously started a course of polio immunisation with oral vaccine you can finish off the course with polio injections. You do not need to start again. Polio immunisation timetable The polio vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases in children and adults. This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Polio mainly affects children under 5 years of age. Polio is very infectious. The infection usually spreads from person to person through contact with the stools (faeces) of an infected person. MMR is a two-shot series of vaccines usually given during childhood. A child should receive the first shot when he is between 12-15 months, and the second when he's between 4-6 years of age. If you're not sure if you have had the diseases or the vaccines (prior to 1971 it was given in three separate shots), you can get the MMR vaccine as an adult. Talk to your doctor about it if: You were born after 1956. (If you were born during or before 1956, you are presumed to be immune, because many children had the diseases then.) In 2000, the U.S. switched to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Using an inactive (dead) form of the virus that cannot cause polio, the IPV is given as a shot in the arm or leg. Who Needs the Polio Vaccine. Most people should get the polio vaccine when they are children. Children should be vaccinated with four doses of IPV at the following ages: Meningococcal vaccine is also recommended for children aged 2 months through 18 years who travel to or reside in areas where N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic; for these children, providers should take care to use a meningococcal vaccine that is licensed for the child’s age group and contains all 4 serotypes (A, C, Y, W-135). The first polio vaccine was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was developed by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955. The oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. It would only take one person infected with polio coming from another country to bring the disease back here if we were not protected by vaccination. If the effort to eliminate the disease from the world is successful, some day we won't need polio vaccine. Until then, we need to keep getting our children vaccinated. Polio vaccine Like any medicine, there’s a very small chance that the polio vaccine could cause a serious reaction. Keep in mind that getting the polio vaccine is much safer than getting polio.

            "input": "It only takes hours for both latex and oil-based paints to dry, but it can take days or even weeks for paint to completely cure. As paint dries, water and solvents evaporate, leaving the pigment and other compounds to bind together and harden. When paint dries, the carrier (typically water in latex paints, a solvent in oil based paints) evaporates, allowing the paint to form a film. As the carrier evaporates, other chemicals that act as stabilizers evaporate as well. The stabilizers prevent the paint curing in the can. Tips and Hints. 1  If you’re unsure if your paint is cured, find an out of the way place and press your fingernail into the paint. 2  Make sure you give your paint the right conditions to dry and cure. 3  If the temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s too cold for paint to dry or cure properly. 4  Quicken dry time by running box fans on fresh paint. Step 1. Allow the enamel paint to cure for a full 24 hours on the glass before applying any heat. If you prefer to slow-cure your enamel on the glassware, it can take up to 21 days. Step 2 This does not mean they are cured. Cure time is when the acrylic film is fully stable, close to its maximum durability, water resistant and less vulnerable to attack by mild solvents. This usually takes at least three days for thin applications and may take much longer (up to two weeks or more) for thick applications.

A: If you need to paint outside with latex paint when temperatures are moving up and down like a yo-yo, I suggest you use one of the latex like Duration, Resilience, or SuperPaint. These products can be applied and will cure at lower temperatures, as low as 35° F. Traditional latex-based paints need temperatures above 60° F to cure properly. The curing time of paint is dependent on a variety of factors, such as: climate, number of coats, type of paint, etc. The greatest determinant is which type of paint you use. Most paints will include the on the label how many hours it takes that paint to dry to the touch. Depending on the ventilation, oil-based paint takes about twelve hours to dry to the touch. Latex paint will feel dry in as few as three hours. However, the full curing time takes much longer. Oil-based Paints. As oil-based paint cures, the thinner evaporates and the oils seep into the pores of the surface leaving behind the binder and the pigment. How long does it take for paint to cure? How long do I need to wait before my walls are finally finished? Depending on color choice, atmospheric conditions, and other variables, latex paint may take up to 30 days for a full cure. Fresh latex paint should be allowed to cure for at least 14 days before attempting to wipe or wash the walls. It can be sensitive to water or chemicals during the curing process. Also note that lower sheens, such as flat or eggshell, will be more susceptible to moisture and chemicals even after fully cured.

Sim van der Ryn was a pioneer in this “green design” movement, and when he was appointed California State Architect by newly elected Governor Jerry Brown in 1975, an opportunity to take these ideas to a larger scale presented itself. The most misunderstood notion in sustainable design today is the idea that it’s a new thing. It’s not. Sustainability is very old school and grounded in common sense. Things were pretty much sustainable until our great, great, great grandparents starting making and selling each other so much stuff. A contraction of permanent agriculture, it is an approach to developing ecological human habitats and food production systems focused not on the separate elements of climate, plants, animals, soils, and water use, but on their relationships and how they are placed in the landscape.

Ecological design is an integrative ecologically responsible design discipline. Summary: Principles of Ecological Design gives insight, inspiration, and guidance for a radical redesign of our way of life. It illuminates a way to disengage from corporate consumer culture, and create a more fulfilling lifestyle. These principles are fundamental to any green building or ecological living initiative. More than any other feature, it is the interaction of the user with the design that enables ecological design to be so much more efficient. For example, recycling requires more thought and action from people than if they put any solid they don’t want in the trash, and any liquid they’re done with down the drain.

So for example, if you filed your 2015 tax return on February 1, 2016, you should have kept the return and supporting documents until at least April 15, 2017. What tax records should I keep? You should keep every tax return and supporting forms. This includes W-2s, 1099s, expense tracking, mileage logs if you itemize and other documents. So why is keeping tax returns for three years important? Keeping tax returns for the three-year time period is tied to the IRS statute of limitations. Query: how long do i keep my tax return?",

People use phosphate salts for medicine. Be careful not to confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous. This acid is too strong to be used on plants and must be combined with other chemicals to raise the pH of the solution and decrease the potential for plant injury. One means of reducing the acidity of phosphonic acid is to neutralize it with an alkali salt; typically potassium hydroxide (KOH).

For this article, we use the term phosphonate to describe only those products made up of the salts and esters of phosphorous acid (HPO(OH) 2 ). Phosphorous acid is a solid substance that can be purchased through chemical supply companies. When mixed with water, it forms a strong acid called phosphonic acid. Among the important phosphate salts are: sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH 2 PO 4), used for control of hydrogen ion concentration (acidity) of solutions; disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na 2 HPO 4), used in water treatment as a precipitant for highly charged metal cations; trisodium phosphate (Na 3 PO 4), used in soaps and detergents; calcium dihydrogen phosphate or calcium superphosphate (Ca[H 2 PO 4] 2), a major fertilizer ingredient; calcium monohydrogen phosphate (CaHPO 4), used as a ... Phosphate salts are also used for improving exercise performance, as an antacid for gastroesophageal reflux disease , and as a laxative for emptying the bowels before surgery. Phosphate salts and calcium are applied to sensitive teeth to reduce pain. Rectally, phosphate salts are used as a laxative to clean the bowels before surgery or intestinal tests. Healthcare providers sometimes give potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) for treating low phosphate and high calcium levels in the blood, and for preventing low phosphate in patients who are being tube-fed.

            "input": "An example of titration using phenolphthalein is the titration of vinegar, which is technically acetic acid. When titrating acetic acid, a titrating solution containing a base—normally sodium hydroxide—is added to the titrand's solution, which contains phenolphthalein (the indicator) and acetic acid (the acidic titrand). And so we can do our calculation here. So we can take 0.000844, and we can divide that by 0.0200, and we get for our answer here 0.0422 molar. All right, so the concentration of HCl is equal to 0.0422 molar, and we are finally done, right? Just a tiny amount of an impurity in a drug could cause a great deal of harm to a patient. Samples of chemicals that are synthesised must be checked for purity. This is often done by carrying out a titration. A titration is used to measure the volume of one solution that exactly reacts with another solution. Steps of titration. A titration is carried out using a number of steps: If the sample is a solid, it is weighed using an accurate balance, and then dissolved to make up a known volume of solution (usually 100cm3). A pipette is used to measure accurately a volume of this solution - for example, 10cm3. The Titration Experiment Titration is a general class of experiment where a known property of one solution is used to infer an unknown property of another solution. In acid-base chemistry, we often use titration to determine the pH of a certain solution. A setup for the titration of an acid with a base is shown in : Figure %: A titration setup 1 At the equivalence point of a titration, an exactly equivalent amount of titrant has been added to the sample. The experimental point at which the completion of the reaction is marked by some signal is called the end point. In Lab Manual CPAP Titration •Optimal CPAP titration –Reduces RDI < 5/hour for at least 15 minutes –Minimum SaO 2 >90% –Supine REM sleep not continuously interrupted by arousals or awakenings –All at the selected “optimal pressure” The endpoint mode represents the classical titration procedure: the titrant is added until the end of the. reaction is observed, e.g., by a colour change of an indicator. With an automatic titrator, the sample is titrated until a predefined measurement value is reached, e.g. pH = 8.2 or E = 100 mV. Blank Titration. A blank titration is carried out by titrating a fixed and known concentration of titrant into a solvent with zero analyte. The only difference from the regular titration is the absence of analyte. Scout Titration. 1  Use a pipet to deliver a known amount of the analyte to the appropriate container (usually an Erlenmeyer flask) which has been cleaned and rinsed with distilled water. Members of the sleep team will calibrate the CPAP during a CPAP titration study. The testing process involves the fitting of a CPAP mask and air pressure.

When the moon is between the Earth and the sun, during the new moon phase, the back side of the moon is bathed in daylight. The orbit and the rotation aren't perfectly matched, however. The moon travels around the Earth in an elliptical orbit, a slightly stretched-out circle. When the moon is closest to Earth, its rotation is slower than its journey through space, allowing observers to see an additional 8 degrees on the eastern side.

In March 2015, three families in Colorado Springs had to flee their homes after a fire spread through two floors of an apartment building, according to a local television report. Fire investigators pinpointed the cause: a build-up of clothes dryer lint. The dryer lint is the fuel a fire needs. The appliance itself is the heat source a fuel needs to produce a fire. Oxygen is present naturally. What is needed at this point to cause a fire is the chemical chain reaction between the oxygen, the heat source and the fuel when it reaches its ignition temperature. If the blocked dryer vent does not allow the heat to escape and the small surface area of the lint reaches its ignition temperature; a fire can occur..

The pests experience high mortality rates in their first year of life but are capable of living up to 15 years in the wild. The average squirrel lifespan is between five and six years. Since the pests are prolific breeders, homeowners dealing with squirrel infestations see populations rise dramatically. The total length of the squirrel ranges from 380 to 525 millimeters (mm). The tail length ranges from 150-250 mm. You can tell eastern grey squirrels apart from fox squirrels by their white tipped fur and white or grayish belly. Eastern grey squirrels often have a lot of red in their fur. Like other squirrels, it has large eyes set on the sides of its head that allow it to see all around with little movement of its head. It can see above and below, an adaptation well suited for life in the trees where danger can come from the ground, through the air, or along a nearby limb. Between 1930 and 1945 it underwent a huge expansion in range; it is now common throughout central and southern England, Wales and the central lowlands of Scotland (3), and is still increasing in terms of range and numbers (6). The grey squirrel has also been introduced to South Africa, Australia (3) and Italy (4). General description: Gray squirrels may have white or brownish bellies and, in winter, white ear tufts. Black and albino squirrels are variations of the gray squirrel. Length: Eight to 10 inches, with a tail roughly the same length. Weight: 1.5 pounds. Color: Mostly gray with a white to rusty-colored underside and rust-colored ears. Asker's rating. 1  Lifespan Of A Squirrel. Source(s): https://shrinks.im/a73un. 2  Squirrel Lifespan. Source(s): https://shrink.im/a8iw9. 3  Smaller rodents live less than the bigger ones, so the natural life span of squirrels varies from 4 to 7 years. They can live longer if they are well taken care of and live a calmed life. Since then they have been repeatedly released in parks, campuses, estates, and residential areas. They are now the most common tree squirrels in urban areas. The upper parts of the Eastern gray squirrel are gray with a reddish wash in summer; its underparts are whitish. It’s about 20 inches long, half of which is its prominent, bushy tail. Average Life Span in the Wild. The average life span of grey squirrels is extremely brief -- generally only between 11 and 12 months, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Despite this brevity in life expectancy, some free roaming grey squirrels have actually surpassed 10 years in age. In Captivity A single female grey squirrel that resided in a captive environment greatly outlived the typical life span of her species, making it to over 20 years old, reports the University of Michigan's Animal Diversity Web. Gray squirrels can be seen out in the winter months as long as the temperatures are not too cold (not below 30 degrees F) and as long as it is not raining or snowing. Food forages are calculated risks in which the use of energy (fat) reserves must yield a profit or the squirrel's vital fat insulation layer will be steadily lost and the individual will be unable to survive the winter. The grey squirrel was introduced to Great Britain in the mid-19th century. There is now an estimated population of 2 million making them much more common than the native red squirrel. 1  Overview. 2  Daily Life. 3  Winter. 4  Breeding. 5  Grey Squirrels and humans. 6  Credits.

In fact, some women experience no physical symptoms at all, except the end of their menstrual periods. Menopause can occur as early as your 30s and, rarely, as late as your 60s. However, there is no correlation between the time of a woman's first period and her age at menopause. Facts to Know. 1  After age 55, more than half of all deaths in women are caused by heart disease. 2  There is a direct relationship between osteoporosis—a disease in which bones lose calcium and become brittle and more likely to fracture—and the lack of estrogen after menopause. Other changes and signs of menopause include: 1  Hot flashes (sudden warm feeling, sometimes with blushing) 2  Night sweats (hot flashes that occur at night, often disrupting sleep) 3  Fatigue (probably from disrupted sleep patterns) 4  Mood swings. 5  Vaginal dryness. 6  Fluctuations in sexual desire or response. 7  Difficulty sleeping. It typically starts in women's 40s, but they can notice changes in their mid- to late 30s. Menstrual periods may get heavier or clottier, and crampy. Irregular periods are another early sign. Bone loss. With estrogen loss, women can have low bone mass and an increased risk of osteoporosis. The most rapid bone loss is the first five to seven years post-menopause, Mendoza says. She likes to order DEXA scans to gauge bone strength early, when women are about 50, insurance permitting. Keeping a sense of humor and talking openly about menopause without shame or embarrassment can help women embrace this new phase, Puryear wrote in a recent blog. 'Foggy' thinking During perimenopause, some women feel they're thinking less clearly, Mendoza says, and it's harder for them to come up with names and numbers. There are ways to be comfortable through menopause, with treatment and lifestyle changes, says Rebecca Mendoza, a certified nurse practitioner at the Menopause Center of Minnesota. It isn't a time to be miserable -- women do well.. Menopause can be disruptive, though. Libido can take a hit from menopause for many reasons, Mendoza says. It's not always hormonal -- long-simmering relationship problems can erupt during this time of change. In her pratice, Puryear says, I tend to talk to women a lot about sex, because [they] get underrepresented in terms of treatment for and help with their sexual needs. Hormone fluctuations in menopause can lead to mood changes similar to premenstrual symptoms, says Dr. Lucy Puryear, medical director of The Women's Place -- Center for Reproductive Psychiatry at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women.

Caterpillars emerge from the eggs and eat for 10 to 12 days before forming chrysalides. Adult butterflies emerge from the chrysalides in 7 to 10 days. In this post, I’m going to explain some of the most unknown facts about how long do butterflies live in captivity and in the wild. A butterfly is a flying insect that belongs to the Lepidoptera order along with the moths and butterflies. The Brimstone butterfly (Gonepterix rhamni) has the longest lifetime of the adult butterflies: 9-10 months. Some Case Moth caterpillars (Psychidae) build a case around themselves that they always carry with them. Q. How does a monarch butterfly know how to fly right away when it hatches out of its chrysalis? A. Instinct. Unlike humans, insects don't have to learn much. They are genetically programmed to do things like fly, find food, and migrate (in the case of monarchs). In some ways, this sounds like a great thing. Monarchs (Danaus plexippus) and Swallowtails may live about a month in the summer, but the Monarchs that migrate to Mexico or to the California coast may live up to six months. Some long-lived tropical butterflies live up to six months as adults. The long-life champion is a tiny yucca moth that feeds on Banana Yucca (Yucca baccata). Dr. In fact, four individual butterflies constitute the four generations that go through the said four phases in the span of one year, and then they start the process afresh starting with the first stage and first generation. 1 What Do Praying Mantis Eat | Praying Mantis Diet. 2  Peacock Butterfly Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Behavior. 3  Pond Snail Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Behavior. 4  Black Swallowtail Butterfly Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Behavior. 5  Karner Blue Butterfly Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Reproduction. Also fall-hatched monarch butterflies migrate south in fall and northward in spring. Adults of these species may survive for 8-9 months or longer. Total Life Span Although larvae eat only milkweed, adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many plants including: 1  Apocynum cannabinum – Indian hemp. 2  Asclepias sp. – milkweeds. 3  Aster sp. – asters. 4  Cirsium sp. – thistles. 5  Daucus carota – wild carrot. 6  Dipsacus sylvestris – teasel. 7  Echinacea sp. – coneflowers. 8  Erigeron canadensis – horseweed. The chrysalis is simply the word for the butterfly during the pupa stage. The outside of the chrysalis is the exoskeleton, or skin, of the pupa. When it becomes time for the larva (caterpillar) to become a chrysalis, the caterpillar spins a silk button from which it hangs. Query: how long does butterflies live",

Any solar energy that you do not use simultaneous with production will go back into the electrical grid through the meter. At night or on cloudy days, when your system is not producing more than your building needs, you will consume electricity from the grid as normal. Touted as a promising alternative energy source for decades, solar panels crown rooftops and roadside signs, and help keep spacecraft powered. But how do solar panels work? Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means they convert sunlight into electricity.) Many cells linked together make up a solar panel. Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semi-conducting material, usually silicon — the same stuff used in microelectronics. To work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field. In addition, the nation’s solar capacity by the end of 2016 is projected to be double what it was at the beginning of 2015, while costs continue to decline and panel efficiencies increase. The question many people have is: How exactly do those panels work? The diagram above illustrates the operation of a basic photovoltaic cell, also called a solar cell. Solar cells are made of the same kinds of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, used in the microelectronics industry. For solar cells, a thin semiconductor wafer is specially treated to form an electric field, positive on one side and negative on the other. When light energy strikes the solar cell, electrons are knocked loose from the atoms in the semiconductor material. What's the biggest difference between how a plant captures light energy and how we do it with solar cells? We wish we could do what plants do because plants absorb the light, and [they use] that electron to change a chemical bond inside the plant to actually make fuel. Could you do artificial photosynthesis and emulate a plant? We would love to be able to make a solar cell that instead of making electricity makes fuel. That would be a very big advance. Solar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are based on a high-tech but remarkably simple technology that converts sunlight directly to electricity < PREVIOUS: The Solar Resource | NEXT: Rooftop Solar Panels > It's an idea that has been around for well over a century. Sun Activation. 1  Photons bombard and penetrate the cell. 2  They activate electrons, knocking them loose in both silicon layers. 3  Some electrons in the bottom layer sling-shot to the top of the cell. 4  These electrons flow into metal contacts as electricity, moving into a circuit throughout a 60-cell module. How Solar Panels Work How a PV cell makes electricity Under the sun, a photovoltaic cell acts as a photosensitive diode that instantaneously converts light – but not heat – into electricity. Basic Steps in Solar Energy Generation and Transmission. 1  Sunlight hits the solar panels, and creates an electric field. 2  The electricity generated flows to the edge of the panel, and into a conductive wire. 3  The conductive wire brings the electricity to the inverter, where it is transformed from DC electricity to AC, which is used to power buildings.

Sensitive pregnancy tests, including commonly-used office or home use urine test kits are likely to be positive between 16 to 60 days. If you have been given an hCG injection (Profasi, Pregnyl) to trigger ovulation or to lengthen the luteal phase of your cycle, trace hCG amounts can remain in your system as long as 10-14 (sometimes even more) days after your last injection.

Some hCG tests measure the exact amount. Some just check to see if the hormone is present. If you continue to have a positive blood pregnancy test, there is a possibility that you are: Pregnant again; Experiencing an incomplete miscarriage; Experiencing a molar pregnancy (very rare) Pregnant Again. If you have been sexually active and have a positive pregnancy test soon after a miscarriage, it's also possible that you might be pregnant again. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta of a pregnant woman. Early in pregnancy, the level of hCG increases in the blood and is eliminated in the urine. A pregnancy test detects hCG in the blood or urine and confirms or rules out pregnancy. During the early weeks of pregnancy, hCG is important in maintaining function of the corpus luteum. As you can see, after an abortion the hCG levels remain up for as long as 60 days. Following an abortion a positive pregnancy test may occur for as long as 60 days post abortion when the termination procedure was successful.

Pounding the meat with a kitchen mallet, or heavy skillet pan is another way to mechanically soften steak. Place the meat in a shallow dish, cover and place it in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours or overnight. You may also use baking soda to tenderize meat. Coat the steak with baking soda and put in the refrigerator, covered, for five to six hours. Wash the baking soda off completely before cooking the meat. Cooks can tenderize steak naturally by marinating the meat in natural acids or enzymes, which softens meat fibers. Yogurt is a dairy-based acidic food that also makes a great alternative meat tenderizer. Bromelain is the active natural enzyme contained in pineapple, and papaya contains an enzyme known as papain. Methods for tenderizing steak include using natural acidic liquids such as lemon juice and vinegar, pounding the meat with a mechanical tool, and scoring meat with a sharp knife. Meat can also be tenderized chemically by using marinades containing fruit enzymes. I do cook flank steak quite often, and usually marinate it for an hour or so in red wine, garlic, olive oil and whichever herbs I have on hand. I've never found the meat to be tough, and do like the flavour. Join the conversation! re: MMRuth mschow Jul 14, 2009 I think my BIL just used a generic brand meat tenderizer.

How do you cook a tender steak in the broiler? A: Cook a tender steak in the broiler by choosing a tender cut of meat or marinating a less-tender cut of meat before cooking. Preheat the broiler before cook... Full Answer > I've never bought it before. However, a few weeks ago, I had some of the most tender and delicious London broil that my BIL made: he claims his secret was the meat tenderizer. He had purchased two London broils. One of them he marinated in Ken's Italian dressing to which he added meat tenderizer. The other piece he added no tenderizer to, but a teriyaki type marinade. We all agreed that the piece with the tenderizer added was far more tender and flavorful. The other piece was much chewier; both pieces were bought at the same store, same day. A: The three main most common ways to tenderize a steak are pounding, marinating the meat and slow cooking. There are also several commercially available meat... Full Answer > However I assure you there is not a CUT of beef known as London Broil recognized by the North American Meat Processors Association. ---If you read the fine print on the label you may see that the piece of meat is from the Top Round, Flank, Shoulder, etc. Again London Broil is a method of cooking...Not a cut of beef.

While this is an acceptable classification, strong arguments can be (and have been) made that Modern Art began at a variety of different dates. Depending on which survey course a person takes, Modern Art is said to have begun with either: 1  Romanticism, in the early 1800s, 2  Realism, in the 1830s, 3  Daguerre's announcement, in 1839, that he had invented a method for making a direct positive image, 4  The writer Baudelaire who, in 1846, called upon artists to be of their time, Vector Art – Roses Illustration in Art Nouveau style. Art Nouveau has seen somewhat of a revival in the last twenty years with the rise of postmodernism design. Artists all over the world use elements of this modern art style as inspiration. Such elements include sinuous lines, floral elements, nature features and the characteristic colors. The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.. Art is a line around your thoughts.. There is no such thing as good painting about nothing.. In the previous posts I started writing about the influence of art history on modern design and I began with the Gothic Style from the Medieval Period, which was followed by the post about the Baroque Style from the Western Art. Today’s post is about another great and influential style, this time from the Modern Art Period: Art Nouveau. If you want to read more about the Modern Art, click here. When and where did the Art Nouveau style appear? Summary: 1  Ancient and modern art refers to two distinct art periods that reflect a particular period of history and human lifestyle. Both art periods have their own characteristics and means of expressing human lifestyle in that period. 2  The period of Ancient art ranges from the Paleolithic period to the Middle Ages. Video art exemplifies this, for the viewer watches the work as it is actually being made; they watch as the process unfolds. Video installation pieces combine video with sound, music, and/or other interactive components. In Nicole Cohen's Please Be Seated, viewers are asked to be active participants. For two decades, French painters and other artists studied the way light changes as you create a landscape or another scene. In Cezanne’s A Modern Olympia (1873-1874), the observer sees another example of how Modern Art abandoned Realism and Naturalism in sketchy borders between forms. Modern Art Timelines give you information about the artists, movements and styles of Modernism from around 1870 to 1975. They help you to understand a century of modern art from Impressionism to Minimalism. They also list the major artists and illustrate a key work from each movement. Definition of Modern Art. Modern art is the creative world's response to the rationalist practices and perspectives of the new lives and ideas provided by the technological advances of the industrial age that caused contemporary society to manifest itself in new ways compared to the past. Here is a short overview of important modern art movements from Impressionism to Op Art. The images on this page are from Wikimedia Commons repository under the GNU Free Documentation License.

Now you’re ready to determine your target training heart rate. As you exercise, periodically: Take your pulse on the inside of your wrist, on the thumb side. For most of us, between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is normal. 1 The rate can be affected by factors like stress, anxiety, hormones, medication, and how physically active you are. An athlete or more active person may have a resting heart rate as low as 40 beats per minute. Now that’s chill! When it comes to resting heart rate, lower is better. 150 beats per minute Important Note: A few high blood pressure medications lower the maximum heart rate and thus the target zone rate. If you're taking such medicine, call your physician to find out if you need to use a lower target heart rate. Use the tips of your first two fingers (not your thumb) to press lightly over the blood vessels on your wrist. Count your pulse for 10 seconds and multiply by 6 to find your beats per minute. You want to stay between 50 percent to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. This range is your target heart rate. Know Your Numbers. This table shows estimated target heart rates for different ages. Your maximum heart rate is about 220 minus your age. Count your pulse for 30 seconds and multiply by 2 to find your beats per minute. Important Note: Some drugs and medications affect heart rate, meaning you may have a lower maximum heart rate and target zone. Before you learn how to calculate and monitor your target training heart rate, you have to know your resting heart rate. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute while it’s at rest. You can check it in the morning after you’ve had a good night’s sleep and before you get out of bed. According to the National Institute of Health, the average resting heart rate: 1  for children 10 years and older, and adults (including seniors) is 60 - 100 beats per minute. 2  for well-trained athletes is 40 - 60 beats per minute. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re at rest. A good time to check it is in the morning after you’ve had a good night’s sleep, before you get out of bed or grab that first cup of java! The easiest way to do this is to use a generic formula meant for the average person. For men, your maximum heart rate can be estimated by subtracting your age in years from 220. For example, a 20-year-old man would have a maximum heart rate of 200 beats per minute. For women, a newer standard is to take 88 percent of your age and subtract it from 206. Beats Per Minute in Exercise. The speed of your heart rate depends on the intensity of exercise that you wish to work at. The American Heart Association recommends exercising somewhere between 50 to 85 percent of your maximum. Beginners should start at the low end of this range and work up as fitness levels improve. There are three general ways to classify heart rate, 1) normal, 2) fast and 3) slow. A resting heart rate is normal between 60-100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate is fast (i.e. tachycardic) at greater than 100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate is slow (i.e. bradycardic) at less than 60 beats per minute.

Europeans are more familiar with white asparagus which is grown completely underground to prevent it from becoming green. There is also a purple variety called Viola. Asparagus plants usually live 8 to 10 years, and the size of the asparagus spear is relative to the age of the plant; in other words, the thicker the vegetable, the older the plant.

Originally Answered: How long does it take to become a black belt in karate? There are a number of ways to answer this but the most correct answer is probably: it doesn't matter. The martial arts are more about the journey than the signposts you achieve along the way. It takes an average of 4-5 years to gain a black belt in karate. Some times longer depending on your age, your natural abilities, body type, coordination levels, fitness levels, the type of sports you have done before, how much you train, how much you listen to your instructor and so on. I remember my black belt grading was the toughest thing I had to go through and prepare for. I had to perform all 11 patterns and black belt pattern. I had to do the basic sets for all belt colours. All of the one step sparring. I had to demonstrate all kicks, and did 10 rounds of 2 minute pad sparring. The Kyokushin Black-belt grading is one of the toughest challenges a karateka can face and takes between five and six hours. It starts off with basics, then focuses on combination work, hand and leg techniques, kata, self-defence (kyojitsu) techniques, stamina and then the gruelling task of completing 40 one-and-a-half-minute rounds of full-contact fighting. How long does it take to get a black belt – in various martial arts? According to a longitudinal study (conducted from 1998 to 2014), the average time taken to get a first-degree black belt is ten years. Of course, this duration differs among martial arts. The shortest recorded training time is four years, while the longest to get a first-degree black belt is twenty-seven years. In Kyokushin it takes an average of five solid years to attain Black-belt level, for someone who does two-hour training sessions three-to-four times a week — but they must also take part in other activities such as seminars and tournaments, for example. Then again, to qualify for a black belt with him, you also have to qualify as a certified instructor of karate. 2 years is way too soon to earn a shodan rank. 4 or 5 years is fast, and average is something like 8-10 years to reach the skill level of shodan. Less isn't more when it comes to time training. Maybe I am asking to much and maybe 5 years to become a black belt is too much FOR THE AVERAGE student, but what I am very true is that 3 years is too little time. Again there could be a very nice student or a gifthed one that with alot of hard work and dedication could be a BB in 3 years and maybe a little less.

Galactose is nearly identical to glucose in structure except for one hydroxyl group on carbon atom number four of the six-sided sugar. Since it differs in only one position about all six asymmetric centers in the linear form of the sugar, galactose is known as an epimer of glucose. they both have their -OH on carbon 4 in different places. up on galactose and down on glucose how is sucrolose made from sucrose by replacing some of the hydroxyl grps iwth chlorine Glucose and galactose are diastereoisomers. The structures of glucose and galactose are Diastereoisomers are Optical isomers of each other. Not mirror images of each other. Not superimposable on each other. Glucose and galactose differ in the configuration at C-4, they are non-superimposable, and they are not mirror images of each other.. They are therefore diastereoisomers. socratic Query: how do the structures of glucose and galactose differ?",

Bronchitis can be acute or chronic: Acute bronchitis typically lasts less than 10 days, but the coughing can continue for several weeks. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, can last for several weeks and usually comes back. This condition is more common in people with asthma or emphysema. Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 Chronic bronchitis keeps coming back and can last a long time, especially in people who smoke.

Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi. Bronchi are the main passageways in your lungs. Inflammation is caused by by virus, bacteria, allergies, or autoimmune diseases. Bronchitis is characterized by... Acute bronchitis, which is a short-term inflammation of the surface lining of the bronchial airways, is most commonly caused by an infection that causes acute bronchitis to be contagious. The infection typically lasts for seven to 10 days, but you may continue coughing for many weeks after the initial symptoms have passed. Acute bronchitis, also known as a chest cold, is short-term inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) of the lungs. The most common symptom is a cough. Other symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and chest discomfort. The infection may last from a few to ten days. Depending on the symptoms and cause of the bronchitis, treatment options include: 1  Antibiotics may be ordered to treat acute bronchitis that appears to be caused by a bacterial infection or for people who have other lung diseases that put them at a greater risk of lung infections. Things your health care provider may recommend include: 1  Rest. 2  Drinking plenty of fluids. 3  A humidifier or steam treatments (such as breathing in the steamy air in a bathroom for 10 - 15 minutes) to help moisturize your airways and relieve swelling. There are several types of bronchitis: 1  Acute bronchitis can last for up to 90 days. 2  Chronic bronchitis can last for months or sometimes years. If chronic bronchitis decreases the amount of air flowing to the lungs, it is considered to be a sign of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Query: how long can you have acute bronchitis",

After patiently waiting for the arrival of her first eggs, she was finally rewarded with a clutch of half a dozen or so waiting for her in one of the nesting boxes, but was concerned by how long it had been since she last checked the box. The eggs may have been sitting there several days before she discovered them. Were they still edible? Q: How long can eggs be left outside once they've been laid before being refrigerated? a: You will want to gather eggs every day, and refrigerate them as soon as they've been gathered. This keeps them freshest. However, in the good old days, of course, eggs were not refrigerated right away. That's surprising to many people! After all, milk that is not refrigerated will go bad, and it will do so pretty immediately... but not eggs. In fact, when a hen is laying eggs to hatch, it can take her about two weeks to gather a clutch large enough to incubate. You're going to get arguments on both sides on this, and most of those people are going to say that their way is best. People say that the eggs bought from stores are more susceptible to salmonella because the bloom is washed off... but those eggs are also weeks old, before they even hit the supermarkets.

That's the scientific definition, but you can take any phase; for instance a so-called full moon cycle would be from Full Moon to Full Moon. The calendar used earlier will appear, but on the right-hand side students can “Go to Lunar Cycle” where they can see images of a full lunar cycle and images of the main phases. You can choose to either have students use the esheet at the two-week point or wait until students have completed a full calendar. Hence the term golden number, still found in our almanacs, which denotes the year of the lunar cycle. Letters on Astronomy Denison Olmsted Thus, fourteen was the golden number for 1837, being the fourteenth year of the lunar cycle. Synodic months are 29 or 30 days in length, making a lunar year of 12 months about 11 days shorter than a solar year. Some lunar calendars do not use intercalation, such as most Islamic calendars. For those that do, such as the Hebrew calendar, the most common form of intercalation is to add an additional month every second or third year. A full lunar cycle lasts almost a month (about 29.5 days), and during that time the moon goes from new to crescent to first quarter to gibbous to full to gibbous to third quarter to crescent and back to new. However, a full moon, a new moon, ... To help students recognize that the moon looks a little different every day, but looks the same again about every four weeks, have them use the Moon Phases student esheet to go to the Lunar Cycle Calendar website. The New Moon is highest in the sky to an earthbound observer at (noon, sunset, midnight, sunrise). The Full Moon is highest in the sky to an earthbound observer at (noon, sunset, midnight, sunrise). Throughout the Lunar Cycle, the Moon will appear further (eastward, westward) in the sky at the same time each day. Therefore, to an earthbound observer, the time of day when the Moon is highest in the sky becomes progressively (earlier, later). However, misconceptions regarding the Moon's apparent change in shape still abound. Some believe that clouds or some other object cover up the Moon, blocking our view of part of it. This may happen, but it is not the mechanism behind the lunar cycle. Others believe that the shadow of Earth or some other object falls on the Moon's surface, causing the phases of the Moon. While the Moon does occasionally cross Earth's shadow, resulting in a lunar eclipse, shadows cast by Earth are not what cause lunar phases. Therefore, although mean Earth orbital eccentricity has a well-known effect on the short-term periodic variation of the length of the lunar cycle (find the word eccentricity on this page), it doesn't plausibly account for its long-term secular variation. In purely lunar calendars like the Islamic calendar, the lack of intercalation causes the lunar months to cycle through all the seasons of the Gregorian year over the course of a 33 lunar-year cycle.

Lower temperatures and higher moisture levels result in a longer curing time. Seven to 28 days According to Concrete Network, concrete should be allowed to cure for at least seven days before it's built on. However, waiting longer will greatly reduce the risk of the concrete cracking. Concrete continues to cure up to 28 days after it is poured, at which point it reaches maximum strength. Bottom Line When a contractor or engineer is in charge of a project, follow the professional's advice, since the result of curing is his responsibility, according to Builder Bill. 4.How long does it take for concrete to dry enough to walk on? Wind, humidity, and sunlight are all factors in how long it takes for concrete to cure, walking, normally about 1 to 2 days. 5. How long does it take for concrete to cure enough to drive on? Again, wind, humidity, and sunlight are all factors but the standard is about 5 to 7 days. 6. Should I put cure or water on the concrete?

Exposure to any bacteria does not necessarily imply that you wil get a disease from it. There are not specific bacteria that only cause pneumonia, so exposure to someone with pneumonia, does not mean the exposed person will get pneumonia.

The researchers found that in a daycare center, four out of five stuffed toys tested positive for S. pneumonaie and several surfaces, such as cribs, tested positive for S. pyogenes, even after being cleaned. Anyone at any age can get walking pneumonia. Walking pneumonia from mycoplasma is most common, though, in older children and adults younger than 40. People who live and work in crowded places, such as schools, homeless shelters, and prisons have a higher risk of contracting the disease. That's because walking pneumonia is contagious. It's spread when someone comes in contact with droplets from the nose and throat of someone who has it. That commonly happens when the person with walking pneumonia sneezes or coughs. Cases of walking pneumonia are most common in the late summer and fall. But infections can occur with no particular pattern throughout the year. Researchers also think it takes prolonged close contact with an infected person for someone else to develop walking pneumonia; still, there are widespread outbreaks every four to eight years. When those outbreaks occur, walking pneumonia can account for as many as one out of every two cases of pneumonia. What are the symptoms of walking pneumonia? Symptoms generally appear 15 to 25 days after exposure to the mycoplasma and develop slowly over a period of two to four days. Almost all children are infected at least once by age two. they were extremely premature or if they have heart or lung problems. monthly injection of an antibody to RSV at the beginning of and continuing throughout the RSV season. addition, they should avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.

It presents as a constellation of symptoms and side-effects with potentially life-threatening endocrine gland and gastro-intestinal Schmidt Syndrome. DEFINITION. Schmidt syndrome refers to the combination of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) with autoimmune hypothyroidism and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and is part of a larger syndrome known as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II or polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type II (PAS II). Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy/dysplasia (APECED), autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, Whitaker syndrome, or candidiasis-hypoparathyroidism–Addison's disease syndrome, is a subtype of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (autoimmune polyglandular syndrome) in which multiple endocrine glands dysfunction as a result of autoimmunity.

Summary Summary. Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is an inherited autoimmune condition that affects many of the body's organs. Symptoms often begin in childhood or adolescence and may include mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and Addison disease. Affected individuals typically have at least two of these features, and many have all three. Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 is an autoimmune disorder that affects many hormone-producing glands. This condition is characterized by the presence of Addison's disease along with autoimmune thyroid disease and/or type 1 diabetes. Affected individuals may also have problems with other endocrine glands. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome is caused by defects in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. This gene plays a critical role in the body’s ability to distinguish between its own proteins and cells and those of bacteria and viruses. As a result, the body attacks its own healthy tissue. Myasthenia gravis: Sometimes this disorder can be associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic neuromuscular disease characterized by weakness and abnormally rapid fatigue of the voluntary muscles, with improvement following rest.

One of history’s great journeys began in October 1934 and ended a year later after covering a distance variously estimated at between 3,000 and 8,000 miles across China. Figures for the numbers involved vary hugely, but fewer than one in ten of those who started the trek apparently reached the end of it. The Long March made the survival of the imperilled Chinese Communist Party possible, gave Mao Zedong a secure grasp on its leadership and ultimately led to the creation of the People’s Republic of China.

The Long March, one of the best known events of the Chinese Revolution, describes the forced relation of the Red Army from Jiangxi in southern China to Shaanxi in the north. 2. This march began with Jiang Jieshi’s fifth and most successful Encirclement Campaign, which was launched against Jiangxi in the autumn of 1933. The Long March 1 was quickly replaced by the Long March 2 family of launchers. Entry into commercial launch market After the U.S. Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed in 1986, a growing commercial backlog gave China the chance to enter the international launch market. This is the story of the Long March of the Communist Party leadership and the Red Army from South China to Northwest China. The source is mainly Harrison Salisbury's book The Long March. Salisbury's book is a very good book that well conveys the drama of the Long March and its three struggles: 1  1. the Red Army with the Nationalist Army of Chiang Kai-shek. 2  2. the Red Army with the elements and terrain of western China. 3  3. the factions within the Red Army with each other.

According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, a fever is indicated when body temperature rises about one degree or more over the normal temperature of 37.0 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). About This Image: Body temperature thermometer Adults: A fever is generally agreed to be present if: 1  Temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.7°C (99.9°F) 2  Temperature in the anus (rectum/rectal) is at or over 37.5 - 38.3°C (99.5 - 100.9°F) 3  Temperature under the arm (axillary) or in the ear (otic) is at or over 37.2°C (99.0°F) In fact, a serious infection, especially in infants, might cause no fever or even a low body temperature (below 97°F or 36.1°C). Because fevers can rise and fall, a child might have chills as the body's temperature begins to rise. The child may sweat to release extra heat as the temperature starts to drop. In general, contact your child's doctor if: 1  Your child is younger than age 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher. 2  Your child is age 3 to 6 months and has a temperature up to 102 F (38.9 C) and seems unusually irritable, lethargic or uncomfortable, or has a temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C). Your child is age 6 to 24 months and has a temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other signs. If your child has other signs, such as a cold, cough or diarrhea, you might call your child's doctor sooner based on their severity. Normal Body Temperature is Highly Variable Keep in mind, this number, whether it’s 98.6 or 98.2 degrees F, is just an average. The human body has a wide range that is considered normal and each individual may have their own normal range. Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is 1 ⁄ 180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water are 100 degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1 °F is equal to an interval of 5 ⁄ 9 degrees Celsius. The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. Though the body temperature measured on an individual can vary, a healthy human body can maintain a fairly consistent body temperature that is around the mark of 37.0 degrees celsius. The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by Amsterdam-based physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736), after whom the scale is named. It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit. Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist. Body temperature in different units. 37 °C is a value that one encounters probably more often than any other temperature reading. If you are used to the Celsius scale, you recognize it immediately. Indeed, a normal body temperature of a healthy person is in the vicinity of 37 degrees Celsius, which makes this value so special and important. For the Fahrenheit folks, you may know it as 98.6 °F (as you can easily verify using our online converter). It is important to realize however that the 37 Celsius (or 98.6 Fahrenheit) value is essentially an averaged benchmark. What is normal depends on various factors, both objective and subjective. At least some of those factors should be taken into account when reaching conclusions about whether one's body temperature is normal. Query: how long is the regular body temperature in fahrenheit",

Standard of Practice II The cleaning of instruments should continue at the point of use post-procedure, B) Disinfecting (the protection for medical personnel from accidental contamination during cleaning) To avoid blood and other proteins from sticking to instruments surfaces, an enzymatic cleaner bath (soaking) should be used on all instruments. After soaking for a minimum of 10 minutes, rinse all instruments in running tap water. STEP 1: CLEANING. The first and most important step in instrument reprocessing is cleaning, as studies [Alfa, 1998] have shown that a dirty instrument cannot be effectively sterilized. This is because the soil shields bacteria and viruses from the sterilizing agent. Another study, testing the efficacy of presoaking compared to an ultrasonic on the cleanliness of endodontic files, found that presoaking did not provide any benefit over the use of an ultrasonic alone. 6 Whether personnel presoak instruments or place them directly into the ultrasonic cleaner, immersing the instruments before blood and other debris have the opportunity to dry improves the efficacy of the cleaning procedure.

And if you take a cab, traveling at 65 miles per hour, it would take you roughly 850 years! The staggering fare is another issue! The Fuel Instead of taking the direct path to Jupiter, it made two gravitational assisting flybys of Earth and one of Venus to pick up speed, finally arriving at Jupiter on December 8, 1995. That’s a total of 2,242 days. So why did Galileo take so much longer to get to Jupiter? It’s because you need to be going slow enough that when you reach Jupiter, you can actually enter orbit around the planet, and not just speed on past. And now, after this long period of Jupiterlessness, we’re about to have another spacecraft arrive at the massive planet and go into orbit. NASA Eyes Mission to Jupiter Moon Europa.

The average distance between the Earth and Jupiter is 483 million miles. If you could travel at the speed of light, it would only take you 43 minutes to get to Jupiter. Since people cant travel at the speed of light, you would probably have to take a rocket ship to Jupiter instead- which would take you about 2.2 years if it was going at top speed the whole way. There have been several probes sent from Earth to Jupiter as of 2014, and it took them between three and five years to get to Jupiter. A few of the missions sent to Jupiter include Cassini, Voyager I and II, Ulysses, and Pioneer 11. It would take 850 years traveling 65 miles per hour to reach Jupiter from Earth.

Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers ambulance services to or from a hospital, critical access hospital (CAH), or skilled nursing facility (SNF). Medicare covers and helps pay for ambulance services only when other transportation could endanger your health, like if you have a health condition that requires this type of transportation. Medicare will only cover ambulance services to the nearest appropriate medical facility that’s able to give you the care you need. EMS agencies typically replace their ambulances — which already cost about $150,000 unequipped — every five to seven years.

These tests may include blood tests, an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart), and/or a chest X-ray. Dr. Leslie Kernisan is the author of a popular blog and podcast at BetterHealthWhileAging.net. She is also a clinical instructor in the University of California, San Francisco, Division of Geriatrics. Atrial fibrillation, also sometimes called A-fib, is usually diagnosed with an electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure that uses electrodes taped to the skin on the chest to measure the electrical activity within the heart. This information creates a tracing, which can be printed on paper or viewed on a monitor. Occasionally atrial fibrillation is noticed incidentally on an ECG or other heart test. More commonly, doctors order an ECG because a person is having symptoms that could be caused by atrial fibrillation, such as palpitations, a racing heartbeat, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Transtelephonic monitor: When you develop symptoms of atrial fibrillation, a strip of your current heart rhythm can be transmitted to your doctor’s office over the telephone, using a monitor with two bracelets or by placing the monitor against your chest wall. How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed? The most commonly used tests to diagnose atrial fibrillation include: Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): The ECG draws a picture on graph paper of the electrical impulses traveling through the heart muscle. An EKG provides an electrical “snapshot” of the heart. For people who have symptoms that come and go, a special monitor may need to be used to capture the arrhythmia. Holter monitor: A small external recorder is worn over a short period of time, usually one to three days. Diagnosing AFib: EKG Your doctor will diagnose atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram (EKG). This heart tracing shows a distinct pattern in the electricity of the heart that your doctor can diagnose. If your AFib comes and goes you may need to wear a continuous heart monitor (Holter monitor) to diagnose the abnormal rhythm. Some of the tests used for making an atrial fibrillation diagnosis include: 1  Electrocardiogram (EKG) 2  Holter monitor. 3  Event monitor. 4  Echocardiogram. 5  Blood tests, including thyroid tests. 6  Electrophysiology study (EPS). Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common type of abnormal heart rhythm. Atrial fibrillation or AF can lead to serious heart complications like stroke. Learn about diagnosing and treating AFib. Atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for stroke. About 15 percent of all people who have strokes have AFib. Because of the irregular and chaotic flow of blood through the heart, small blood clots can form in the heart chambers when you have atrial fibrillation. These clots can travel through the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.

Can you explain why it is harder to move an object thrugh the surface of water than it is to move the same object when completely submersed in the water. Surface Tension Surface tension is the skin-like surface of a liquid due to the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. The diagram below shows an imagined magnified view of the surface of water, the molecules of liquid at the surface do not have other like- molecules above them. This is why there is surface tension and takes a certain amount of energy to break these intermolecular bonds. Same goes for other liquids, even hydrophobic liquids such as oil. There are forces between the liquid such as Van der Waals forces that are responsible for the intermolecular forces found within the liquid. Surface Tension. Surface tension is the skin-like surface of a liquid due to the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. The diagram below shows an imagined magnified view of the surface of water, the molecules of liquid at the surface do not have other like- molecules above them. 1 Surface tension is the energy, or work, required to increase the surface area of a liquid due to intermolecular forces. Since these intermolecular forces vary depending on the nature of the liquid (e.g. water vs. gasoline) or solutes in the liquid (e.g. surfactants like detergent), each solution exhibits differing surface tension properties. What is Cohesion and How does it Relate to Surface Tension. 1  The spheres of water form due to surface tension.

Notice the forces between the molecules represented by the red arrows. Surface tension is the energy, or work, required to increase the surface area of a liquid due to intermolecular forces. Since these intermolecular forces vary depending on the nature of the liquid (e.… You've seen examples of surface tension in action: water striders walking on water, soap bubbles, or perhaps water creeping up inside a thin tube. What, exactly, is surface tension? Surface tension is defined as the amount of energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a unit amount. So the units can be expressed in joules per square meter (J/m2). You can also think of it as a force per unit length, pulling on an object (Mellendorf, 2002). It will then take a certain amount of energy to break these forces, and the surface tension. Water is one liquid known to have a very high surface tension value and is difficult to overcome. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) : (a) A paper clip can “float” on water because of surface Surface tension causes the surface of a liquid to pull together forming the smallest surface area possible.When a liquid is in a container, such as water in a glass, the liquid is also attracted to the molecules making up the container.

            "input": "Having maxed out credit cards, but on-time payments my credit score prior to filing for Ch 7 was 530, post discharge it was 632 and now six months later is 692! There is life after Bankruptcy! GWNorris3rd's response was: Bankruptcy will ruin your credit for some time to come. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can remain on your credit report for up to 10 years. Although a bankruptcy stays on your record for years, the time to complete the bankruptcy process under Chapter 7, from filing to relief from debt, takes only about 3-6 months. If you decide against Chapter 7 when it may be the right decision for you, your missed debt payments, defaults, repossessions, and lawsuits will also hurt your credit, and may be more complicated to explain to a future lender than bankruptcy. The impact to your credit score is largely based on where your credit stands now and what information is on your credit report.​. In 2010, FICO released information about how bankruptcy and other credit mistakes affect your credit score. Using a mock scenario with two different credit profiles, FICO showed a bankruptcy could cost up to 240 points for someone with a 780 credit score and 150 points for someone with a 680 credit score. And, while a bankruptcy can severely damage your credit score, that doesn’t mean that bankruptcy has to be the end of a good credit rating forever. How Long Does Bankruptcy Stay On The Record. There are two types of bankruptcy – Chapter 13 bankruptcy and Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: Plus, as long as your report is filled with nothing but A+ grades, you should have a decent credit score within a few years, and even a good score by the time the bankruptcy drops off your report. 4. Keep Your Oldest Accounts Active Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. The bankruptcy itself and the debts associated with the bankruptcy will be displayed differently on your credit report. A completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy will stay on your report for up to seven years, and discharged debts will also stay on the report up to seven years after they are discharged. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Last? In most cases, it takes approximately three to four months to complete a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and obtain a discharge. However, if you have a complex case or creditors object to your discharge, it can take longer. This means that you can complete your case quickly and begin rebuilding your credit right away. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Remain on Your Credit Report? A Chapter 7 bankruptcy will usually stay on your credit report for ten years. But in general, this does not prohibit you from obtaining new credit and moving on with your life. In fact, most debtors start receiving new credit card offers shortly after they receive their discharge. To do this we’ll need to set the record straight on some of the most commonly held misconceptions about how bankruptcy impacts credit scores. Myth #1: Having no negative information on your credit report prior to bankruptcy leads to a higher post-bankruptcy credit score than if your report contained derogatory information prior to the filing. Myth #3: You will have a low credit score for as long as the bankruptcy information remains on your credit report. Fact #3: While it’s true that you should not expect a high score following bankruptcy, if you manage your credit optimally in its aftermath you can be looking at a 700 score or higher after only about 4-5 years. You cannot file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy if you previously went through bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 within the last six years. If you obtained a Chapter 13 discharge in good faith after paying at least 70% of your unsecured debts, the six-year bar does not apply. Query: how long bankruptcy affect credit",

            "input": "At least, that’s the conclusion I draw from looking at the history of corrections of the S&P 500 Index based on daily data going back to December 30, 1949. Now that major indexes have officially entered correction territory, investors are wondering how long corrections tend to last. Let’s start with the worst-case scenario of a bear market. If a bear market is a move of 20% or more from peak-to-trough and a correction is a move of 10% to just under 20%, then the average bear market is a drop of 31.6% (median of 30.3%). I don’t think this is the start of a bear, though. As long as the future trend remains optimistic, the buying will resume. That leads to an even stronger bull market rally. In other words, a stock market correction can help the stock market catch its breath and hit even higher peaks. Most recessions occur with stock market declines of 30 percent or more. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. The current pattern looks more like 2011 than 1998, with some significant economic differences. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. How long do corrections last? Corrections generally last two months or less. They usually end when the price of a stock or a bond 'bottoms out'—for example, some will point to a stock reaching a 52-week low—and investors start buying again. How is a correction different from a bear market or capitulation? The stock market typically has a correction several times a year. For example, between 1983 and 2011, more than half of all quarters had a correction. That averages out to 2.27 per year. A stock market crash is when the 10 percent price drop occurs in just one day. Crashes can lead to a bear market. That's when the market falls another 10 percent, for a total decline of 20 percent or more. A stock market crash can cause a recession. The stock market usually makes up the losses in three months or so. If you sell during the correction, you will probably not buy in time to make up your losses. Corrections are inevitable. Is a correction good for the market? Many investors and analysts look at corrections as a necessary 'evil' to cool off an overheated stock or bond market. This is to prevent a huge sell-off or 'bubble burst,' as what happened with Internet stocks in 2000-2001. Definition: A stock market correction is when the market falls 10 percent from its 52-week high. Wise investors welcome it. A pullback allows the market to consolidate before going toward higher highs. Each of the bull markets in the last 40 years has had a correction. It's a natural part of the market cycle. Corrections can occur in any asset class. A correction is a decline or downward movement of a stock, or a bond, or a commodity or market index. The amount of the decline is at least 10 percent and a true correction exceeds that amount. In short, corrections are price declines that stop an upward trend.

These electric signal as encoded and transfered as a anolog signals and then to digital as 0s and 1s..... transfered to the other end...... Although sound is commonly associated in air, sound will readily travel through many materials that are solid, liquid and gas. 1  Solids are made up of particles (atoms) that do not move about because they are closely packed (touching each other) and held together by strong intermolecular forces. Your eardrum vibrates from sound waves to allow you to sense them. We might be able to detect it through vibration of solids, the ripple in liquid but you can only detect it in air by hearing it. In spite of this, humans cannot hear all sounds that travel through the air. The crowded or loose grains cause the electric current to become stronger or weaker. The current copies the pattern of the sound waves and travels over a telephone wire to the receiver of another telephone. For more modern phones that have a telephone answering service, the sound wave is captured on a recording device which allows for the operator of the phone to playback at a later time. Sound travels in mechanical waves. A mechanical wave is a disturbance that moves and transports energy from one place to another through a medium. In sound, the disturbance is a vibrating object. And the medium can be any series of interconnected and interactive particles. This means that sound can travel through gases, liquids and solids. Sound (in air) is made when air molecules vibrate and move (away from the vibrating source) in a pattern called waves, or sound waves. Sound is a mechanical, longitudinal wave (that moves in all directions) and travels in waves of compressions and rarefactions (expansion) as it successively passes through a medium. The diaphragm presses against these carbon grains. Low voltage electric current travels through the grains. This current comes from batteries at the telephone company. The pressure on the carbon grains varies as sound waves make the diaphragm vibrate. A loud sound causes the sound waves to push hard on the diaphragm. It is a wave which is created by vibrating objects and propagated through a medium (solid, liquid or gas) from one location to another. A vibrating source can be sound coming from a drum, speaker of a radio, the mouth of a person (vocal chord), a car engine, a plane above the sky and so on. The speed of a sound wave depends upon the medium through which it travels. In general, sound travels faster through solids than through liquids or gases. Also, the denser the medium, the slower sound will travel through it. The same sound will travel at a different speed on a cold day than it would on a warm day. 1 How the Telephone Works. When a person speaks into a telephone, the sound waves created by his voice enter the mouthpiece. An electric current carries the sound to the telephone of the person he is talking to. A telephone has two main parts: (1) the transmitter and (2) the receiver. Query: how does sound travel through a telephone?",

The rhinovirus' (common cold) incubation period is between 12-72 hours. Most people show symptoms closer to the 72 hour mark, but it depends on your immune system and the virus you contract. Influenza's incubation period is 1-4 days with 2 days being the most common for showing symptoms. There are many viruses that cause cold and flu symptoms that are not the common cold or influenza. If you were exposed to one of those it may take up to 7 days before symptoms appear. How many people get sick or die from the flu every year?

It’s important to note that withdrawal is a normal, natural, healthy part of recovery. People who go through it might feel ill and uncomfortable, but those feelings do pass. Frequently Asked Questions - Xanax Drug Test / Valium Drug Test Q: What are benzodiazepines? A: Benzodiazepines are a very large family of prescription drugs that include Valium, Xanax, Librium, Ativan, Halcion, Diazepam, and Klonopin. 1 Valium is a federal controlled substance (C-IV) because it can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep Valium in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. 2  It is not known if Valium is safe and effective in children under 6 months of age. 3  It is not known if Valium is safe and effective for use longer than 4 months. Common Valium side effects may include: 1  drowsiness; 2  tired feeling; 3  muscle weakness; or. 4  loss of coordination. Valium belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which work by increasing the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that moderates the activity of nerve signals in the brain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved diazepam in 1963 under the brand name Valium for the Roche drug company. If you have any questions on how to use Valium for opiate withdrawal symptoms, feel free to post them in the comment box below. Most results conclude smoking tobacco does in fact hinder the effects of Diazepam (I have read the science behind why, but it doesn't seem relevant to my interest). I do not smoke cigarettes, never have, and never will. I do vape quite often so this is a very important subject to me as I do take Valium. It's been a struggle finding the exact answer the to titled question (for me). I sincerely apologize if I have overlooked a post which exactly answers this concern. TL;DR - Does vaping nicotine decrease the effects of Diazepam's anxiety relief. Does Zoloft (sertraline) have a similar effect on the body as valium, but Zoloft (sertraline) takes longer to work?

Additional Amendments of the Constitution. Download a PDF of the Additional Amendments. The Constitution contains within itself the process for changing it. The amendment process is described in Article 5. Amendments can be proposed in Congress when 2/3 rd of both Houses agree. There are 27 Amendments to the US Constitution. There has been only one 'change' in the Amendments, and that involves the 18th and 21st Amendments. The Amendments in History. 1  The Bill of Rights (Amendments 1-10) 2  Sovereign Immunity of States (Amendment 11) 3  Of Presidents, Senators, and Members of Congress (Amendments 12, 17, 20, 22, 25, & 27) 4  Civil War Reconstruction (Amendments 13, 14, & 15) 5  Income Tax (Amendment 16) 6  The Short Reign of Prohibition (Amendments 18 & 21) The last two amendments address the liberties of citizens and the rights of states. The Ninth Amendment states that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights do not define all of the fundamental rights people have. Such rights exist whether or not they are defined. The Tenth Amendment makes a similar claim concerning the rights of the states. After the first enumeration, required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred; to which number one Representative shall be added for every subsequent increase of forty thousand, until the Representatives shall amount to two hundred, to which number one Representative shall be added for every subsequent increase of sixty thousand persons. Proposed following the often bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The Bill of Rights (Amendments 1-10) Proposed September 25, 1789; Adopted December 15, 1791 It's almost impossible to imagine the United States (U.S.) Constitution without having a Bill of Rights, but when it was first being drafted, a majority of the Founding Fathers didn't think it was necessary. Criminal Amendments in the Bill of Rights by Scott Grabel The Bill of Rights is a crucial component of the United States Constitution that was designed to ensure the basic rights of the country's citizens. Originally, it consisted of ten amendments. Later, an additional seventeen amendments were added to the Constitution. Certain parts of these additional amendments and the Bill of Rights have had a major impact on the criminal justice system. These amendments include the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and the fourteenth amendments. The Sixth Amendment establishes a number of rights of the defendant in a criminal trial: 1  to a speedy and public trial. 2  to trial by an impartial jury. 3  to be informed of criminal charges. 4  to confront witnesses. 5  to compel witnesses to appear in court. 6  to assistance of counsel.

I'm like you, been on this for about a week and my pain levels are inconsistent. I'm okay in the morning but my pain is greater in afternoon/evenings despite being on the patch for 6 days now. Get emergency help right away if you take too much BUTRANS (overdose). 1  When you first start taking BUTRANS, when your dose is changed, or if you take too much (overdose), serious or life-threatening breathing problems that can lead to death may occur. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the BUTRANS dose. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 72 hours, BUTRANS dosage may be adjusted every 3 days. Dose adjustments may be made in 5 mcg/hour, 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour increments by using no more than two patches of the 5 mcg/hour, or 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour system(s). The minimum BUTRANS titration interval is 72 hours, based on the pharmacokinetic profile and time to reach steady state levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The maximum BUTRANS dose is 20 mcg/hour. Do not exceed a dose of one 20 mcg/hour BUTRANS system due to the risk of QTc interval prolongation. The QTc evaluation was performed during the third day of BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour and the fourth day of 2 x BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour when the plasma levels of buprenorphine were at steady state for the corresponding doses [see Warnings and Precautions ]. There was no clinically meaningful effect on mean QTc with a BUTRANS dose of 10 mcg/hour.

LOVE the ketchup swirl 3  ! we pan fry our burgers since our backyard isn’t set up to BBQ just yet. I slivered my onions instead of dicing, and used 1/3 pound patties of 93/7 ground beef, cooking about six minutes on a side for a perfect medium rare. The skillet I used had just cooked a pound of bacon, and I just poured off the fat before putting the onions in. Although the appearance of the center tells cooks how done a hamburger is, it can be difficult to tell from the appearance of the exterior. The most reliable way to test how done a hamburger is is to use a meat thermometer. The interior temperature of a medium-well done hamburger should be around 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit. Cooking a medium-well done hamburger on a grill should take about four and a half minutes per side. Cooking times can vary depending on the heat of the grill. Food Safety Meanwhile, heat a pan over medium heat and add the diced onion to sweat. When the pan has come to temperature, add the burgers on top of the bed of onions. Cook for 4 minutes on both sides for rare, or until the liquid coming out starts running clear. For medium well, add about 2 minutes on both sides. Note that how many you can cook at a time depends on how large your pan is. I wouldn’t cook more than two at once as crowding will slow down the cooking. Like any meat, let the burgers sit for 5 minutes off of heat for them to retain their juices. Serve with any condiments you could desire. You can cook a delicious hamburger on your stove. Hamburgers made on the stove can taste just as good as, if not better than, hamburgers cooked on a grill. When frying up a burger that is anything less than well-done, your main concern is safety. Bacteria occurs naturally in meat products. Buy the freshest possible ground beef and store it below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Use ground beef within two days of purchase and cook it to a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit.

At some point, investors would begin to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its debt obligations, which would require the government to pay much higher interest costs to borrow money. By Brian Schilling. In 2009 as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the federal government set aside $27 billion for an incentive program that encourages hospitals and providers to adopt electronic health records systems (EHR). Government budget: Government budget, forecast by a government of its expenditures and revenues for a specific period of time. In national finance, the period covered by a budget is usually a year, known as a financial or fiscal year, which may or may not correspond with the calendar year. The word budget is derived slightly outpaced by state government (47.6 percent) and well above the federal contribution (8.5 percent). When it comes to processing the various sources, districts usually keep their state and local funds separate from federal funds. In this Budget, the government will take action to: 1  make additional savings equivalent to 0.5% of total government spending, to ensure the nation lives within its means. 2  back business with a major overhaul of corporation tax reliefs, a lower corporation tax rate and a big reduction in small business rates. 1 A reserve policy, which establishes the desired level of reserves to maintain.

The guitar is an easy instrument to play badly, but with practice anyone can learn to play well. In this lesson I just want to clear up a few things so that you know what to expect of this course, and of yourself. Simply put, find one guitar-related thing a day that you didn’t know already and learn it. And play it. It can be a riff, a lick, a chord, a scale, an exercise, a song, a melody, an altered tuning, a strum pattern, the part of a song you know all of the cool riffs of but never bothered to learn the “boring” connecting transition sections of, whatever. Perhaps a reasonable answer to ‘How long does it take to learn guitar?’ would be about eighteen months to two years. After a year or two, you’ll know more about where you want to go with the guitar. You’ll be able to play confidently, without making mistakes. Yeah…but really… how long does it take to learn the guitar?? Ok. I’ve seen some other websites give timeframes (like: “if you practice regularly, in 1-2 months you can play most chords”; or “in 1 year you can play most songs”). I think that’s crazy. What does “most songs” mean? Or “most chords”? Query: how long does improvement take learning guitar",

Report only facts. Don’t worry about what the work mean, or whether you like it or not. The guidelines below can be used to describe works with or without recognizable shapes. You may not use all of the items listed in the guidelines for a particular work. Transparent (you can see through it) Translucent (light comes through it) Crystalline (has crystals in it) Magnetic (a paper clip is attracted to it) Color descriptors How would you describe a sedimentary rock? Sedimentary rock is one of the three main rock groups (along with igneous and metamorphic rocks) and is formed in three main ways-by the deposition of the weathered remains of … other rocks (known as clastic sedimentary rocks); by the deposition of the results of biogenic activity; and by precipitation from solution. Describe how these three rock units sit relative to each other. Points to Consider. Imagine that you are a civil engineer. How could you use a topographic map to build a road, bridge, or tunnel through an area like the one shown in Figure above? Would you want your road to go up and down or remain as flat as possible? Such material, called detritus, consists of fragments of rocks and minerals. When the energy of the transporting current is not strong enough to carry these particles, the particles drop out in the process of sedimentation. This type of sedimentary deposition is referred to as clastic sedimentation. Limestones formed from this type of sediment are biological sedimentary rocks. Their biological origin is often revealed in the rock by the presence of fossils. Some limestones can form by direct precipitation of calcium carbonate from marine or fresh water. Limestones formed this way are chemical sedimentary rocks. A rock layer would need to have spaces between grains or cracks or hollow spaces to hold water. 2 Record the volume of water pumped and the time it took to pump it. Calculate the flow rates. 3 What differences do you see in the material of each rock layer? Describe particle size, particle shape, and the general shape and number of pore spaces in each rock. Sandstone has sand-sized particles that are relatively round with many pore spaces and good connection between the pore spaces. Shale has smaller, flatter particles than sandstone. Flowing water slows down when it reaches flatter land or flows into a body of still water. What do you think happens then? The water starts dropping the particles it was carrying. As the water slows, it drops the largest particles first. The smallest particles settle out last. Erosion and Deposition by Surface Water ALERT: NOTE THAT THE WORD 'CRYSTALLINE' HAS TWO DIFFERENT MEANINGS, DEPENDING UPON THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE WORD IS USED: 1  In a mineralogical context, 'crystalline' means that the atoms within a substance are arranged in a regular, geometric fashion.

            "input": "Martian New Year. On May 5, 2017, Mars passes solar longitude 0 as the Sun crosses the equator on Mars. This is the vernal equinox, and was chosen by planetary scientists as the start of a new year (A Mars year is 687 Earth days). This is year 34 on Mars. (That works today, but eventually we will have more than 24 hours to get this job and others done. A lot more. In a few billion years, a day will last about a month!) Saturn is a giant ball of gas, however. There is no firm surface anywhere in sight. Making things more confusing, Saturn has some of the solar system's fasted winds, up to 1,000 mph. Earth takes 24 hours to complete a day, but Saturn takes 10 hours and 32 minutes. A year on Earth is, obviously, 1 year, while a year on Saturn lasts 30 years. Due to Saturn's tilt and Earth's changing orbital position, Saturn's rings tilt in and out of view over time. Saturn's rings tilt out of view when they are edge-on as viewed from Earth. This is called Saturn's ring plane crossing. Saturn's rings are edge-on to the Sun two times during Saturn's 29.42-year orbit. So if Mars and Earth are side-by-side every 780 days, let's figure out how long it takes for Mars to go around exactly once. We know that in 780 days, the Earth has revolved around the sun twice in 730 days, with 50 days left over. In those 50 days, the earth goes around the sun 50/365 of an orbit. Since Mars and Earth are neck-and-neck in 780 days, Mars must have been lapped in its race with the Earth. They are at the same place on the track (50/365 along it), so Mars must have run 1 (50/365) laps in 780 days. Padalka logged his own 365th day in orbit back in 2004 on what was just his second mission. Now set to fly on his fifth long-duration flight, he will become the new worldwide record holder for the most cumulative time in space when he completes his current mission, topping 900 days. [One-Year Space Station Mission: Full Coverage] How Long Is A Day On Saturn? Date: May 3, 2006 Source: Particle Physics & Astronomy Research Council Summary: Measuring the rotation period of a rocky planet like the Earth is easy, but similar measurements for planets made of gas, such as Saturn, pose problems. Researchers from JPL, Imperial College London and UCLA present new results in this week's Nature (4th May 2006) that may solve the mystery. A: One year on Neptune is equal to around 165 Earth years or 60,190 Earth days, which is the amount of time it takes the planet to complete its orbit around the sun. Days on Neptune last about 16 hours, which is 8 hours less than Earth. 1. Mercury: One year on planet Mercury takes just 87.97 earth days. This means that if you are 15 years old on Earth you would be 62 years old in Mercury years. 2. Venus: It takes 224.7 earth days for Venus to travel once around the sun. If you are 15 years old on Earth, this would make you 24 years old in Venus years. 3. Earth: One year on planet Earth, or one orbit around the sun, takes 365.26 days. 4. The length of one sidereal Earth year is 3.39% the length of one sidereal Saturn year. In other words, the length of one sidereal Saturn year is 29.5.

How long do microbes like bacteria and viruses live on surfaces in the home at normal room temperatures? Art Dekenipp Alvin, Texas. The answer is probably not what you want to hear: Microbes can live on household surfaces for hundreds of years. The good news, however, is that most don't. Some well-known viruses, like HIV, live only a few seconds. Microbes, of course, are everywhere. Each square centimeter of skin alone harbors about 100,000 bacteria. And a single sneeze can spray droplets infested with bacteria and viruses as far as 3 feet. It can last up to 2 weeks. The length of time that cold or flu germs can survive outside the body on an environmental surface, such as a doorknob, varies greatly. But the susp…ected range is from a few seconds to 48 hours - depending on the specific virus and the type of surface. Other factors, such as the amount of virus deposited on a surface and the temperature and humidity of the environment, also determine how long cold and flu viruses stay active outside the body. It's possible to catch the flu or a cold after handling an object an infected person sneezed or coughed on a few moments ago. How long can germs stay alive on a piece of paper?I am trying very hard not to get sick this year. When a student hands me a piece of paper, I try not to touch it. Am I being silly? Can I get sick from the paper? How long after an ill child touches the paper can I get sick from it? It depends on the type of germs or bacteria on the paper. Viruses cannot live for a full minute outside of the body because they need a living host. Once they fall out onto surfaces in that 3 to 6 foot distance, they can live on the surfaces for around 48 hours. See the related question below for more information on how long flu viruses live on surfaces. The flu is nothing like some of the nasty gastrointestinal viruses, like the bane of all cruise ship vacationers, norovirus. “Some of those viruses can survive on an object for months and withstand cleaning with bleach,” Hay tells WebMD. “Influenza isn’t like that.” There have been studies of how long significant amounts of flu germs can survive on surfaces. Estimates range from a few minutes up to 24 hours, depending on the type of surface. (It lives longest on hard surfaces.) First of all, flu is caused by a virus, not bacteria. Second, any type of soap will do. “Time and thoroughness are what matters when it comes to washing your hands,” says Schaffner.

Researchers have found that the microscopic infected droplets emitted in a cough or sneeze float around the air in large enough concentrations to spread disease. Breathing in airborne specks of virus found in a typical office, doctor’s surgery, plane or train could infect a person after just one hour.

You may also wonder how long it takes to get sick after you have been exposed and how long you are contagious when you have it. Flu Incubation Period.

This means that if you are exposed to the influenza virus and become infected, you will start to experience flu symptoms anywhere between 24 hours and four days after the exposure. Viral Shedding. Influenza spreads mainly by respiratory droplets that contain copies of the virus that have replicated in your body. Viral shedding, which correlates with infectivity, occurs starting approximately 1 day before symptoms appear and can continue for up to 10 days after symptoms develop. The most active period of contagion falls between 1 and 4 days after the start of symptoms, according to a May 2010 article published in the Journal of Infectious Disease. The study also found that in a small number of cases, infection transmission occurred before symptoms appeared. If you are exposed to someone with the flu, avoid close contact with the person, and wash your hands frequently. 1  Vitamin C: Although Vitamin C is widely used and has many benefits, there is no scientific proof that it will help you avoid an illness such as the flu or a cold. Tamiflu Actions. Tamiflu acts by reducing the number of cells in your body that are affected by the influenza virus. It does this by binding to a coating, called neuraminidase, that's found on the surface of the virus. Neuraminidase allows the virus to penetrate healthy cells, where it can then produce more copies of the virus. After symptoms start, adults can spread the virus for five to 10 days. However, the amount of virus spread decreases significantly after three to five days. Adults are most contagious with the flu from 24 hours before symptoms start to three to five days afterward. Flu symptoms generally don't come on gradually. 1  More often, people describe the onset of flu as if they were hit by a truck..

The 2015 Major League Baseball season is less than a week old, but there are signs that changes designed to increase the pace of play in the league are having an effect.

In the comparable period from 2014, there were 33 nine-inning games that averaged 3 hours, 1 minute – 9 minutes more than so far this year. For the entire 2014 season, the average length of games was just one minute more than the opening stretch at 3:02. The pace of the game has slowed dramatically over the years. In 1981, the average length of games was 2:33. There is nothing wrong with long games if there is enough baseball to fill the hours.

However, if the final score is 15-10 and there are multiple people on base every inning than a game could last 4 hours.

            "input": "(plural cast fossils) A fossil formed when an animal, plant, or other organism dies, its flesh decays and bones deteriorate due to chemical reactions; minerals gradually enter into the cavity, resulting in a cast, also called a mold fossil, which is in the general form of the original organism. Link/Cite. Fossil - Types. 1  Index fossils (also known as guide fossils, indicator fossils or zone fossils) are fossils used to define and identify geologic periods (or faunal stages). They work on the premise that, although different sediments may look different depending on the conditions under which they were deposited, they may include the remains of the same species of fossil. The mold is the impression in the rock it left. This is like pouring chocolate into a mold. When the chocolate hardens, it pops out as a chocolate cast, ready to eat. Examples: Fossil shells are often casts, and shell impressions on rock are often molds. A fossilized footprint is a mold. Plant fossils and trilobites are often found as casts and molds. There are two main types of fossils: body and trace fossils. 1  Body fossils - Body fossils are fossils where some portion of the actual organism's body remains as part of the fossil. This might be a tooth or piece of bone. 3. What is a cast fossil? 4. What is a true form fossil? Motivation: Ask students if they know what the different types of fossils are. Can they describe different kinds of fossils? Show the following types of fossils, taken from http://enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/dinofossils/Fossiltypes.html and discuss each one. The first picture is a fossil in amber, the second one is a trace fossil, the third is a mold fossil, and the last one is a cast fossil. Procedure: Write on the bottom of each fossil their name and if it is a cast or mold. Have students form two lists to describe what they see in the two 'fossils', hair, shape, texture, size, color, etc. Have students write on paper which fossil gives them the most information, mold or cast (3-D) and why. Cast and mold are a type of fossilization where the physical characteristics of organisms are impressed onto rocks, especially coarse porous rocks such as sandstones. Fossils are remains of life from the past. The most common kinds of fossil preservation are molds and casts. The activity will give students the chance to make modern day molds and casts. Goal: To teach students two common fossil types; a mold and a cast. Best Answer: C. A mold fossil is filled with water that contains minerals that harden into a stone replica. A is how you make a trace fossil B is how you make a ... There are four primary types of fossils: mold fossils, cast fossils, trace fossils and true form fossils. Cast fossils are formed when the imprints created by fossils, called mold fossils, are filled in by minerals over time. Definition of Cast Fossils. A cast fossil is a type of fossil indicator.

But remember, eggs, like a lot of other dairy products (actually eggs are technically classified as animal products… but, since they are purchased in the dairy section of stores we listed them under dairy), usually have a sell by date and not a use by date. Hard boiling eggs can make eggs transportable as a snack on the go or part of a packed lunch. Storing either raw or hard boiled eggs properly is important for food quality and safety concerns. Both raw and hard boiled eggs should be stored in the refrigerator. How long raw and hard boiled eggs last in the fridge Even though some refrigerators have built in egg shelves on the refrigerator door, eggs should be kept inside the refrigerator. Eggs should be kept at 40 degrees or lower, so if they are stored in the inside of the refrigerator they are more likely to stay at a constant temperature. Interesting Facts about Hard Boiled Egg Shelf Life: 1  The term hard boiled eggs is actually misleading because eggs should never be subjected to a hard rigorous boil, it should be a soft gentle boil. 2  Salmonella is killed by the heat of cooking (once the yolk and white are both firm). 3  Boiling removes the protective coating on the egg shell. Refrigerator Storage: Refrigerate eggs at 40°F or less. Store them in their original carton on an inside shelf and away from pungent foods. The temperature on an inside shelf remains more constant than one on the door, which is opened and closed frequently. After hard boiling eggs, they should be stored in the refrigerator as well.

            "input": "Various signs and symptoms to identify a dry socket are: 1  Excruciating pain 3-4 days after tooth extraction. 2  Exposed bones under gums. 3  An empty socket at the location of tooth extraction. 4  Partial or complete loss of blood clot. 5  Radiating pain from the socket to eye, ear, or neck on the same side from where, the tooth has been extracted. Pain that starts to get worse after two days is considered abnormal and you may want to see your dentist. This could be a sign of “dry socket”. Dry Socket. A dry socket occurs when the blood clot for healing becomes dislodged or doesn’t form. In that case, the bone and fine nerve endings are not protected and exposed to air, food, and liquids. Dry socket delays the healing process and can be very painful. If you suspect dry socket, see your dentist. For example, after evaluating the outcome of 400 wisdom tooth extractions, Sweet (1979) [page references] determined that: Patients who smoked 10 cigarettes a day experienced a more than fourfold rate of dry socket formation (12% vs 2.6%). The rate for patients who smoked 20 cigarettes daily was 20% higher. If the extracted tooth is shallow-rooted premolar, an incisor or a canine, and it has no major infection, an immediate implant placement can be performed. If the extracted tooth is a molar with a healthy supporting bone, an immediate-delayed implant placement procedure (about two weeks to three months) can be performed. If the extracted tooth has a bone loss from disease in the gum, then a delayed or late implant (three months or more after tooth extraction) can be conducted.Learn more about Dental.

The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States. It appears on most of its seals, including the Seal of the President of the United States. The skeleton of a bald eagle weighs 0.5 lbs (250 to 350 grams), which is only 5 to 6% of the total weight of the bird. The bones are extremely light, because they are hollow, and the feathers weigh twice as much as the bones (American Bald Eagle Information). The bald eagle’s average body temperature is 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius). Bald eagles have a massive wingspread of about 7 feet (2.13 meters), according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Their bodies are much smaller, though, at only 34 to 43 inches (86 to 109 centimeters). Normally, bald eagles weigh 6.5 to 14 pounds (3 to 6.5 kilograms).

Attending law school on a part-time basis is an option at many law schools, but it does mean you’ll be studying for four rather than three years. Some states, such as Colorado, don’t even require that you attend law school. How long does it take after submitting an application to get accepted at USA universities? How long does it take to get a law degree in the UK? Why does law school take so long to finish? Students wishing to become attorneys often ask the question, How long does it take to get a law degree? The answer to that question is varied depending on the path a law student chooses to take. The first step in the educational timeline starts when obtaining a bachelors degree. Soon after graduating from, law school, you’ll need to sit for the bar exam in your state, or in the state where you want to practice law. Studying for the bar exam will likely consume two to three months of your time and will take an additional few months to get the results. Most people who pursue a career as a lawyer generally take the traditional path of earning a bachelor’s degree followed by three years of law school. The amount of time this actually will take you depends on whether you attend school full-time and pass the bar exam on the first try. Next it depends on whether you're a Presumptive Admit, Presumptive Deny, or Discretionary Admit. Presumptive admits and denies can take 2 to 4 weeks after the application is ready for review, depending on the backlog.

What score do you need to have to get accepted into law school? Why did it take this long for schools to make laws in schools? This portion of the process can take up to a year due to study time and available testing dates. A student would do well to begin this process while they are earning their undergraduate degree. The final phase of a law degree is law school. Law school programs are typically three years. Unlike a student's undergraduate degree, law school does not allow a student to choose their own pace. Law students are required by most law schools to complete the law program in three years. Under special circumstances, an extension may be permitted but that is not the norm. Taking all the above factors into account, the shortest path to law school is approximately six years. , J.D. 35 years in law school admissions. Published, quoted, wined and dined.

(See Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis and Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history and Wilson disease: Diagnostic tests.) Serum concentration of copper and of non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper. Most individuals with Wilson disease have a subnormal serum copper concentration that is proportional to the serum ceruloplasmin concentration. Note: Serum copper is low in healthy newborns. But in people with Wilson's disease, copper isn't eliminated properly and instead accumulates, possibly to a life-threatening level. When diagnosed early, Wilson's disease is treatable, and many people with the disorder live normal lives. Wilson's disease care at Mayo Clinic Molecular genetic studies that use DNA from blood cells to search for patterns of differences or similarities, a procedure called haplotype analysis may establish whether a full sibling of an affected patient has Wilson disease, is a carrier of the Wilson disease gene, or is not a carrier. With Wilson disease, the copper builds up in your liver, and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain, kidneys, and eyes. Wilson disease is present at birth, but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver, the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it. Treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body. Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2, which plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. A person’s chances of having Wilson disease increase if a health care provider has diagnosed one or both parents with the condition. What are the signs and symptoms of Wilson disease? The signs and symptoms of Wilson disease vary, depending on what organs of the body are affected. Wilson disease is present at birth; however, the signs and symptoms of the disease do not appear until the copper builds up in the liver, the brain, or other organs. When people have signs and symptoms, they usually affect the liver, the central nervous system, or both. Points to Remember. 1  Wilson disease prevents the body from getting rid of extra copper. 2  Wilson disease first attacks the liver, the central nervous system, or both. 3  Anyone with unexplained liver disease or neurologic symptoms with evidence of liver disease should be screened for Wilson disease.

Notably, the detection of influenza viral RNA by these assays does not necessarily indicate detection of viable infectious virus or on-going influenza viral replication. It is important to note that not all assays have been cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use. The signs and symptoms of influenza can vary by age, immune status, and presence of underlying medication conditions. Uncomplicated influenza can include any or all of these signs and symptoms: fever, muscle aches, headache, lack of energy, dry cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, and possibly runny nose. Dr. Robert Vanzant used the quick test for flu in January and February, but he never expected to bring it out again as we head into summer. This is not flu season, so if someone has the flu this time of year we have to consider swine flu, said Dr. Van Zant, a family practice physician. He demonstrated the flu quick test for us by sticking a cotton swab up both nostrils. Both sides and it's gonna tickle. I'm digging for china here, said Dr. Vanzant. After swabbing both nostrils, the swab sits in liquid for a minute, then the test strip goes in and results come back in 10 minutes. It's the same technology that's used for the home pregnancy test, said Dr. Vanzant. Our test is negative, but other tests are examples of what a positive test looks like. Among respiratory specimens for viral isolation or rapid detection of human influenza viruses, nasopharyngeal specimens typically have higher yield than nasal or throat swab specimens. As with any diagnostic test, results should be evaluated in the context of other clinical and epidemiologic information available to health care providers. Preferred respiratory samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and nasal wash or aspirate, depending on which kind of test is used . Rapid Influenza Testing. The diagnostic accuracy of influenza swabs is often overestimated by clinicians. The CDC notes that rapid influenza testing has a sensitivity ranging from approximately 50% to 70% — meaning that in up to half of influenza cases, the flu swab results will still be negative. Another study in Turkey showed that the sensitivity of rapid influenza testing for H1N1 ranged from 31.7% to 50%, again depending on the brand of test. During a respiratory illness outbreak in a closed setting (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facility, cruise ship, boarding school, summer camp) testing for influenza can be very helpful in determining if influenza is the cause of the outbreak. So how sensitive are they for “flu-like illness”? Rapid Influenza Testing The diagnostic accuracy of influenza swabs is often overestimated by clinicians. The CDC notes that rapid influenza testing has a sensitivity ranging from approximately 50% to 70% — meaning that in up to half of influenza cases, the flu swab results will still be negative. Preferred respiratory samples for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal or nasal swab, and nasal wash or aspirate, depending on which kind of test is used (see table(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-testing-methods.htm)). Samples should be collected within the first 3-4 days of illness. Laboratory Diagnostic Procedures. A number of tests can help in the diagnosis of influenza (see table(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/table-testing-methods.htm)). But, tests do not need to be done on all patients with suspected influenza. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) provide results within approximately 15 minutes; viral culture provides results in 3-10 days. Most of the rapid influenza diagnostic tests that can be done in a physician’s office are approximately 50-70% sensitive for detecting influenza and approximately greater than 90% specific.

Full Answer > An atom becomes an ion when it loses or gains an electron. An atom is electrically neutral. The protons and electrons are equal and balance each other. An ion is either positive or negative, depending on whether it gains or loses an electron. A calcium atom becomes a calcium ion by losing two electrons. Electrons are negatively charged, so losing two electrons creates an ion with a charge of 2+. According to the octet rule, atoms gain or lose electrons to fill their outer energy levels. This helps them achieve noble gas configuration. Calcium is atomic number 20 on the periodic table. Its nearest noble gas is argon, which has an atomic number of 18. To achieve argon's electron configuration, calcium needs to lose two electrons. When it does this, it becomes a positively charged ion. Although calcium is in the same period as the noble gas krypton, the calcium never attempts to attain krypton's electron configuration. This is because it takes less energy to lose two electrons than it would to gain six electrons and fill the outer energy level. Normally, an atom has the same number of positive particles (protons) and negative particles (electrons). 1  So the number of protons is identical to the number of electrons, and both are identical to the atomic number. 2  An ion with more electrons than protons carries a net negative charge and is called an anion.

The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning in 1935, later shortening this to 11 games in 1937 and 10 games in 1943, mainly due to World War II. The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970.

Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. Symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those persons may still spread the virus to others. The lymph nodes can swell making turning the head painful. The eyes can be sensitive to light. There can be a dry annoying cough.

The person remains contagious for 5 to 7 days, as long as the body is producing new mucus, and they are also contagious as long as they have a fever. The Flu Is Contagious Most healthy adults may be able to infect other people beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. But just because you don't exhibit these symptoms, it doesn't mean you don't have the flu, researchers say. And you could be just as contagious. In fact, their study found that roughly three-quarters of people with seasonal or pandemic flu show either no symptoms or mild ones that aren't usually linked to flu. People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.

If you have already been exposed to the flu, but you don't have any symptoms, you can take Tamiflu for up to 6 weeks to help prevent you from getting sick. People often mistake the flu for the common cold, Hayward tells Shots. A lot of the time you may just have a runny nose, a bit of a cough, perhaps a sore throat, he says. But the classic flu symptoms of a sudden fever and muscle aches — the study shows that that very often doesn't happen. And it's often a much more mild illness. Influenza's incubation period is 1-4 days with 2 days being the most common for showing symptoms. There are many viruses that cause cold and flu symptoms that are not the common cold or influenza. If you were exposed to one of those it may take up to 7 days before symptoms appear. Discover how taking Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) within 48 hours of flu onset may help reduce the amount of time you are sick and help prevent the flu. Indications: Tamiflu is a prescription medicine used to treat the flu (influenza) in people 2 weeks of age and older who have had flu symptoms for no more than 2 days. Tamiflu can also reduce the chance of getting the flu in people 1 year and older. Tamiflu does not prevent bacterial infections that may happen with the flu. Query: how long can you have the flu",

Attached to the side of the machine is a magazine of different tools. A transfer arm, sometimes called the tool bar, removes a tool from the machine, places it into the magazine, selects a different tool from the magazine, and returns it to the machine through instructions in the program. The fourth category covers modern machine tools and processes for machining ultrahard metals not machinable by older methods. 1  Machine tools that form parts by removing metal chips from a workpiece include lathes, shapers and planers, drilling machines, milling machines, grinders, and power saws. Modern machine tools cut or form parts to tolerances of plus or minus one ten-thousandth of an inch (0.0025 millimetre). In special applications, precision lapping machines can produce parts that are within plus or minus two millionths of an inch (0.00005 millimetre). The motions that are used in machine tools are called axis, and are referred to as X (usually left to right), Y (usually front to back), and Z (up and down). The work-table may also be rotated in the horizontal or vertical plane, creating a fourth axis of motion. After the advent of the steam engine, material goods were produced by power-driven machines that could only be manufactured by machine tools. Machine tools (capable of producing dimensionally accurate parts in large quantities) and jigs and fixtures (for holding the work and guiding the tool) were the indispensable innovations that made mass production and interchangeable parts realities in the 19th century. Machine tool: Machine tool, any stationary power-driven machine that is used to shape or form parts made of metal or other materials. The shaping is accomplished in four general ways: (1) by cutting excess material in the form of chips from the part; (2) by shearing the material; (3) by squeezing metallic parts to the desired shape; and (4) by applying electricity, ultrasound, or corrosive chemicals to the material. Welding the base. 1  1 The base of the machine is either cast or welded together. It is then heat treated to remove casting or welding stresses and to normalize the metal for machining. 2  2 The ways are ground flat, bolted, and pinned to the base.

It has a climate-controlled enclosure mounted on the side of the frame or in an operator's console. 2  6 The assembled machine is test run for accuracy. In particular, machine-driven tools became necessary to manufacture the parts for the machines that now made goods formerly produced by hand.

(To learn more about the “no contact rule” I highly recommend you check out The No Contact Rule Book) Now that you have a pretty good idea of how the no contact rule works I want to move on to the next step. Experts say it takes about 21 days to stick to a new habit, but I've found that heartbroken people need a little more time than that. So similar to Greg Behrendt, author of It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken, I recommend following the No-Contact Rule for two whole months. Within those two months, here's what's probably going to happen: 1. Clarity. Going back and forth with an ex often causes stress and confusion. The no contact rule is always going to be more effective if you aren’t living with your ex. That’s just the way it is and anyone who tells you anything differently is lying straight to your face. BUT the no contact rule can still be effective if you live with the person so don’t go into a depression just yet. But experience has taught me that this isn’t always the best practice. For some situations 30 days may be too long and for others it may not be long enough. That’s why you will see me recommending three different time frames when it comes to the no contact rule, The 21 Day Rule. The 30 Day Rule. The 45 Day Rule.

Because most birds do not have penises, the sex act and consequent conception are slightly different than in a mammal. They release sperm from the cloaca, a small posterior opening. Females also have a cloaca, which they use to receive sperm. Copulation is non-penetrative, and lasts only a few seconds. Ryan, Tom. How Do Birds Conceive? Animals - mom.me, http://animals.mom.me/birds-conceive-9240.html. Accessed 13 February 2018. The time sperm remains viable in the oviduct or infundibulum is not precisely known and it is probably variable. However, in other species the viability of sperm drops off after about 10 to 15 days. Generally it is believed that the effective mating takes place about 4 to 10 days before an egg is laid. The egg journey down the oviduct is about 3 days. It is during the first day immediately following when the yolk erupts from the ovary and is swallowed up by the infundibulum that most fertilization takes place. Reproductive Organs. While birds have the same internal organs that allow creatures like humans to conceive, such as testes and ovaries, one organ is often conspicuously absent: the penis. In most species, males do not have penises, and their testes are housed deep inside the body rather than in a dangling scrotum. Query: how long are eagles pregnant for",

In many areas of psychology, it is a minimum requirement for someone to have completed a doctorate degree. This includes counseling psychologists and licensed clinical psychologists. In fields, such as health psychology and school psychology, the same degree is often required. Psy.D., Ph.D. or Ed.D? In order to become a licensed clinical psychologist, you need an undergraduate degree (4 to 5 years of college) plus a doctorate in psychology (4 to 7 years of graduate school). For this specialty area, most people will spend between 8 to 12 years in a higher education setting. This takes between four and five years to complete. Here, you will learn the basics and fundamental theories of psychology. This is followed by a two to three year master's degree option, which allows for wider career choices, including those for social workers, employment specialists and case managers. Following on from the bachelor's degree, you will need to complete a two to three year master's degree. This will introduce you to the field of psychology in a far more in-depth manner. You will also be able to choose a field of specialization, although not all schools offer this option. The length of time you will need to complete your degree depends on the type you have chosen. 1  As such: 2  Ph.D. programs generally take between five and seven years to finish. The curriculum will be made up of extensive coursework, but you will also have to complete a supervised residency or internship. If you do have a degree in a different field and want to become a psychologist, you may have to complete a number of prerequisites before you are accepted to a graduate program in psychology. Earn Your Master’s Degree (Timeline: 2 to 3 Years) They can do some research on psychology or teach, but this is rare. Instead, they tend to work in an applied setting where they provide direct services to people with mental health issues. The Ed.D. option, which is the Doctor of Education, is the final option. This is the best degree for those who want to work in some form of educational psychology. This degree is the least common out of the three, due to the fact that it is very specific. The time it would take to achieve a doctorate degree in psychology varies depending on your chosen pathway and your career goals. As such: 1  Ph.D. programs generally take between five and seven years to finish. The curriculum will be made up of extensive coursework, but you will also have to complete a supervised residency or internship. 2  Psy.D. programs take between four and six years to complete on average. With a Ph.D., however, you will have a greater understanding of psychology and research therein, as well as being able to conduct and apply research. Once you have graduated with a doctorate degree, you can expect to get to work in colleges, schools, government, health care systems, social services agencies, nonprofit organizations and market research firms.

Squid are a diverse group of invertebrates (animals without backbones), and range in size from barely two and a half centimetres (Idiosepius sp.) to a total length approaching 18 metres (giant squid Architeuthis sp.). ''Absolutely sensational'' new pictures are rare proof that the world's largest toothed whales feed on elusive giant squid. And if researchers are right, the photos may also show a baby whale's hunting lessons. Octopuses & Squids. About AquaFacts: AquaFacts are a resource for students who are looking for information on the animals at the Aquarium or other Aquarium-related topics. Here, we’ve compiled some of the most frequently asked questions that we’ve received about octopuses. How the colossal squid feeds The colossal squid is a predator, and it hovers in the dark depths of the ocean looking for prey. We know that colossal squid eat toothfish — the squid on display was hauled up on a toothfish longline, still attached to the fish it had been eating. Toothfish caught on longlines often show signs of squid damage. Adult toothfish can grow up to two metres long, so the colossal squid is clearly a capable hunter, even in the dark. Effective predator Unfortunately, the giant squid Architeuthis has not been studied enough to make a comprehensive diet. From the few that have been dissected though, it was discovered that they would eat sperm whales that dive deep underwater. Squid are very adaptable though so they will find things to consume when they need to. They are going to consume any type of meat in the water, even if it is other squid when their normal sources have been depleted. This is a way for them to continue to evolve and to survive. The broadest list is: 1  Architeuthis dux, Atlantic giant squid. 2  Architeuthis hartingii. 3  Architeuthis japonica. 4  Architeuthis kirkii. 5  Architeuthis martensi, North Pacific giant squid. 6  Architeuthis physeteris. 7  Architeuthis sanctipauli, southern giant squid. 8  Architeuthis stockii.

Squids most commonly eat fish, crustaceans and other squids. Even the world's smallest squid is a predator, the southern pygmy squid (Idiosepius notoides). The females of this species grow to about 1 inch long, and males are about 3/4 inch. On the opposite end of the size spectrum is the giant squid (Architeuthis dux), the largest invertebrate in the world. One of the largest beaks ever recorded was on a 495-kilogram colossal squid. The beak had a lower rostral length of 42.5 millimeters. Many beaks have also been discovered in the stomachs of sperm whales, as the stomach juices dissolve the soft flesh of the squid, leaving the hard beaks behind. Query: how does a giant squid eat?",

On average, occasional marijuana users will test positive for 1-3 days after usage. On average, frequent marijuana users will test positive for up to 46 days after usage. Individuals who have been using marijuana regularly for many years can test positive up to 67 days after usage. How Long Does Marijuana Stay in Blood? Blood tests are another common drug test used to analyze drug usage. For single time users and occasional users, marijuana can be detected in a blood test 12-24 hours after usage.

But hair testing can't show very recent drug use (in the last few days), and so for detection of recent drug use, employers would use urine testing, Quest said. In 2015, about 7 percent of the U.S. workforce tested positive for marijuana using hair drug testing, according to Quest data. For marijuana testing, samples are analyzed for a breakdown product of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), called THC carboxylic acid. It's very hard to fool a drug hair test, Quest said. In brief: Depends on use. It depends on how often you use it. If you used it only once it can be detected by blood for 12-24 hours while it is detected in urine from 1-7 days. With regular use it can be detected in blood for 2-7 days and in urine anywhere from 1-100 days even if a heavy user. Age, height, weight, metabolism all are considered factors. But how does marijuana get into hair, and how long does it stay there? The New York Police Department officer — Sgt.

Initial symptoms commonly include: 1  Loss of appetite. 2  Chills. 3  Mental and physical fatigue/weakness. 4  Aching muscles. 5  These symptoms are usually followed 2-3 days later by: 6  Fever. 7  Headache. 8  Sore, reddened throat with enlarged tonsils. 9  Swollen glands in the neck, armpits and/or groin. Some people become infected with EBV but do not develop symptoms. This is called a subclinical infection. How long do the symptoms last? The glandular fever symptoms usually resolve by themselves within two to three weeks of the initial infection. Initial three to five days will be the worst followed by improvement in a gradual course. The fever usually lasts for 10 to 14 days and declines in severity after the initial three to five days. Fatigue however may persist for up to three to six months. Normal activity may be resumed within one to two months of the infection. In young children the onset of the glandular fever is usually short term. Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing (it is often referred to as the kissing disease) exposure to coughs and sneezes. sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed forks and spoons. https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/glandular-fever The information on this site should not be used as an alternative to professional care.

Day of the Dead is still celebrated throughout Mexico and has even gone Hollywood: Daniel Craig's James Bond pursued a baddie through Mexico City during a massive Day of the Dead carnival in 2015's Spectre. The 2014 film The Book of Life features a Day of the Dead theme and animation filled with calacas (skeletons) and calaveras (skulls). Over the last several years, a growing number of people of Mexican and other Latin American descent have celebrated Day of the Dead throughout the U.S. The Mexican diaspora to the states during the 1990s through the early 2000s largely contributed to that, says Alberto Fierro, executive director at the Mexican Cultural Institute.

Interest compounds over the life of a reverse mortgage, which means that the mortgage can quickly balloon. Since no monthly payments are made by the borrower on a reverse mortgage, the interest that accrues is treated as a loan advance. If you have a lifetime mortgage and even if the total amount of the loan plus any interest exceeds the property's value your house cannot be repossessed as long as you have maintained it and complied with the mortgage agreement. The total amount, capital plus interest, is repaid when you die or move into long-term care. The average value of equity release loans in 2014 was £65,000, according to the industry body, the Equity Release Council. If you have a property worth £400,000 and want to free up £65,000, for example, the best rate on a lifetime mortgage is currently 5.05pc from a lender called New Life.

Equity release schemes enable you to take cash from the equity built up in your property. They are targeted at older homeowners who would struggle to take on a regular mortgage and probably have little or no income to make regular repayments. The minimum age is typically 55 on lifetime mortgages and 60 on reversion plans. No, unless you choose an interest only lifetime mortgage. Lifetime mortgage plans may suit you if you have a regular source of income and can therefore afford to pay interest on a monthly basis. The benefit of this is that the amount of the loan does not increase. It may be possible to pay all of the interest or a proportion dependent on what you can afford.

How to Convert Your Cat's Age to Human Years. The method of cat age conversion below utilizes averages only. Some purebred cats, such as Maine Coons, mature much slower and don't reach full development for three or four years. Like humans, cats age in relation to genetics, diet, exercise, care at home, and veterinary care. Most people think that calculating the age of dogs and cats in “human years” is quite simple: multiply their age by seven. For example, a 4-year-old dog or cat would actually be 28 years old in human years. But when you really begin weighing out the arithmetic, this method doesn’t add up. Say a 1-year-old dog is the equivalent of a 7-year-old human -- get out of here! How many 7-year-old humans are sexually active and capable of reproducing? Dogs and cats are much more likely to have babies at 1 year old or even at 10 years old, than any person who is 7 or 70. Here's How: 1  Allow 15 human years for the first year of your cat's life. 2  Add nine years for the second year. 3  Add four human years each for successive years of his life. 4  When all else fails, refer to the accompanying chart. Calculate the age of your cat in human years. Nowadays cats tend to live longer - the average life-span of a 21st century cat is estimated at between 10-15 years. There are many contributing factors, including better diet, care and medical advances. Cats mature very early. Here's How: 1  Allow 15 human years for the first year of your cat's life. 2  Add nine years for the second year. A two-year old cat will approximate 24 human years. 3  Add four human years each for successive years of his life. 4  When all else fails, refer to the accompanying chart. Still, it's worth it to get an idea of how old your cat is in human years. Follow the four steps below: Allow 15 human years for the first year of your cat's life. Add nine years for the second year. A two-year-old cat will be approximately 24 human years. Add four human years for each successive years of his or her life. Still, it's worth it to get an idea of how old your cat is in human years. Follow the four steps below: Allow 15 human years for the first year of your cat's life. 1  Add nine years for the second year. A two-year old cat will approximate 24 human years. 2  Add four human years each for successive years of his life. 3  When all else fails, refer to the accompanying chart. Your cat is in its prime from three years to six years and develops into a mature cat from seven to 10 years old. When your cat reaches its senior age, from 11 to 14 years old, care begins to change more dramatically. Calculate the age of your cat in human years Nowadays cats tend to live longer - the average life-span of a 21 st century cat is estimated at between 10-15 years. There are many contributing factors, including better diet, care and medical advances. Now let’s take a glimpse at a simple formula for calculating feline age in human years. Assume that a 1-year-old cat is equal to a 15-year-old human and a 2-year-old cat is equal to a 24-year-old human. Then add four years for every year after that. (Example: A 4-year-old cat would be 32 in human years.) The following chart shows this formula of calculation: Cats generally live 12 to 15 years, although outdoor cats live an average of only 10 years or so.

Fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and over 100 times stronger than morphine. Due to this, it is typically prescribed to patients with an injury, who are experiencing severe pain, or after a patient has undergone surgery. Interpretation. 1  Opiates are the natural or synthetic drugs that have a morphine-like pharmacological action. 2  Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a synthetic opiate made from morphine and is rarely detectable in body fluids. 3  Ingestion of bakery products containing poppy seeds can also cause morphine to be excreted in urine. If excessively large amounts are consumed, this can result in urine morphine concentrations up to 2000 ng/mL for a period of 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Due to first-pass metabolism, no pharmacologic effect is experienced from poppy seed ingestion. Till date, it is used widely along with morphine to sedate a person and dull severe pain. Opium is also one of the most abused substances in the world today. What are Opiates? Opiates are a class of drugs which are derived from opium. The principle alkaloid of this class of drugs is morphine, which is also one the most widely used painkillers as well as most abused drug. Even in the times of ancient Sumerians, the chemical properties of opium and its effects on the brain were known and studied. A: Morphine generally is detectable in blood for up to 12 hours after use, in saliva for up to four days, in urine for up to three or four days and in hair follicles for up to 90 days, according to About Health.

The third table lists five common classes of drugs and information related to their detection in a urine drug test (i.e., primary metabolites, typical detection cut-off, potential sources of false positives, The most commonly used opiates are heroin, hydrocodone, morphine, and codeine. Heroin is a particularly fast-acting drug with a very short half-life. A saliva test will only be able to detect heroin for the first 5 hours after the last dose, and blood tests work for an average of 6 hours.

When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, they don't mix as they have different densities (a bit like oil and water). Instead, the warm less dense air is pushed up over the cold dense air creating the 'front'. Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Describe how does precipitation occur and what determines the type of precipitation that falls to Earth? Precipitation occurs due to the immense collection of water vapor in the form of clouds. When the water vapor in these clouds gets too heavy, it falls. Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation: 1  Light rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per hour. 2  Moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm (0.098 in) - 7.6 mm (0.30 in) or 10 mm (0.39 in) per hour. Rain & Floods How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exists in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example, in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. Most of the condensed water in clouds does not fall as precipitation because their fall speed is not large enough to overcome updrafts which support the clouds. For precipitation to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke particles, which act as a nucleus. Precipitation - Measurement. 1  The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100 mm (4 in) plastic and 200 mm (8 in) metal varieties. [74] 2  Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.

One medium head (2-1/2 pounds) of green cabbage yields 9 cups shredded raw and 7 cups cooked. The top portion of the cabbage head is more tender and shreds easier than the bottom. If it is practical, cut the head horizontal and use the top, raw in salads and slaw and use the bottom half in cooked recipes. Add two handfuls of cabbage stirring for about 30 seconds, continue adding cabbage and stirring at 30 second intervals until all of the cabbage is in the pot.

            "input": "Super giant slalom, or super-G, is a racing discipline of alpine skiing. Along with the faster downhill, it is regarded as a speed event, in contrast to the technical events giant slalom and slalom. The vertical drop for a Super-G course must be between 350–650 m (1,150–2,130 ft) for men, 350–600 m (1,150–1,970 ft) for women, and 250–450 m (820–1,480 ft) for children. In the Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships, and FIS World Cups, minimums are raised to 400 m (1,300 ft) for both men and women. The men's super-G race at the world championships was postponed to Thursday because of too much snow on the course. That means a powder day for Miller. For Ted Ligety and the rest of the American team, too. U.S. men's head coach Sasha Rearick thought about taking the squad over to nearby Vail, Colorado, for some training, but had a change of heart. And the next and the next — it's a long two weeks of racing. To make room on the docket for the super-G competition, a men's downhill training session scheduled for Thursday was scrubbed and the women's training run was moved to later in the afternoon. Just trying to make the best of a snowy situation. The men’s Super-G final will take place on Sunday morning, with American Bode Miller looking to break out of his slump and find a way on to the medal podium at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The race will begin bright and early at 1 a.m. ET, with live coverage of the event will be available on NBC Olympics Live Extra.

Olympics Olympics Home Much like downhill, the other of the two speed events in alpine skiing, a super-G course consists of widely set gates that racers must pass through. The course is set so that skiers must turn more than in downhill, though the speeds are still much higher than in giant slalom (hence the name). Ligety is the defending in the super-G champion after winning in Austria two years ago. He won three gold medals at those championships. He's a big fan of this course, too.
