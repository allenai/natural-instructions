    "Definition": "You are provided with an arithmetic question. Your task is to compute the solution using the given arithmetic operations. The only arithmetic operators needed to answer the questions are'+'(addition) and'-'(subtraction). The answer should be correct to one decimal place.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Joan found 70 seashells on the beach. She gave Sam some of her seashells, after which she has 27 seashell left. How many seashells did she give to Sam?",
            "output": "43.0",
            "explanation": "The total number of seashells found by Joan is 70. Since she now has 27 seashells left, it implies that she gave 70-27 = 43 seashells to Sam. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place is 43.0."

            "input": "There were 28 bales of hay in a barn. Tim stacked some more bales in the barn today. There are now 54 bales of hay in the barn. How many bales did he store in the barn today?",
            "output": "26.0",
            "explanation": "The total number of bales in hay today is 54 and we know that there were 28 bales present already. Hence the number of bales he stored today will be 54-28 = 26. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place is 26.0."

            "explanation": "The recipe requires 8 cups of flour and since 2 was already put, she now needs to put 8-2 = 6 cups more. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place is 6.0."

            "explanation": "The sum of defeat and wins must add up to the total number of games played. We know that there were 12 games played and 4 of those were lost. Hence the number of wins is 12-4 = 8. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place is 8.0."

            "explanation": "The number of walnut trees at the end of the day are 55 and it's given that 22 walnut trees were already present. So the number of trees that the workers planted today will be 54-22 = 32. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place should be 32.0."

            "explanation": "The number of peaches picked by Mike will be the difference between the total number of peaches he has now and the ones he had already, that is, 86-34 = 52. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place should be 52.0."
