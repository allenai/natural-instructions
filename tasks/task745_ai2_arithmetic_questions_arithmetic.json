            "output": "43.0",
            "explanation": "The total number of seashells found by Joan is 70. Since she now has 27 seashells left, it implies that she gave 70-27 = 43 seashells to Sam. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place is 43.0."

            "explanation": "The total number of bales in hay today is 54 and we know that there were 28 bales present already. Hence the number of bales he stored today will be 54-28 = 26. Hence the correct answer till 1st decimal place is 26.0."
