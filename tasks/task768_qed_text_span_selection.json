Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that On the common some young men were playing at hockey . That old - fashioned game , now very uncommon in England , except at schools ... Hockey 's popularity increased with that of other team games . A version of the game played in south - east London was rougher than the modern version , played on a very large field ( 247m by 64m ) , and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks . The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs , especially Teddington Hockey Club . The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise , but did not particularly care for football . In 1870 , members of the Teddington cricket club , who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park , were looking for a winter activity . They experimented with a ' stick ' game , based loosely on the rules of association football . Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball , so allowing smooth and predictable motion . By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game , including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it . An association was formed in 1875 , which dissolved after seven years , but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College , Cambridge . Blackheath were one of the founder members , but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union .

A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net , or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal . A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six - foot - wide net that is close to 180 feet away , while avoiding opposing defencemen ; in the case of own goals , the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians . And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998 , it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing .\nQuestion: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations\n",
