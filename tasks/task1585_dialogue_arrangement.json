    "Definition": "You are given a list of dialogues between a user and an agent. These dialogues have been shuffled, meaning that they are not in correct order. The task is to arrange them in the correct order. Please note that even though the dialogue exchange mostly takes place in a serial manner (first dialogue is by the user and second dialogue is by the agent), there can be instances when two consecutive dialogues may be said by the user or the agent.",
