If the penitent does not like or agree with what the Church teaches then the priest cannot force him or her to accept the teaching, he can only point out the consequences both temporal and eternal of rejecting that teaching.\nTo say that conscience is paramount is to misinterpret the doctrine of primacy of conscience. How do we form our consciences? Basically there is something inside each of us which enables us to distinguish right from wrong in most situations. In more complex situations we Catholics have the Church's teaching authority to inform our consciences. If we are prepared to reject what the Church teaches, why are we going through this 'spiritual direction' at all?",

It's about a cultural way of seeing reality that is rooted deeply in European history, culture and theology.\n\nWhat's happening here doesn't warrant more white naval gazing, the normal response to every failure of the culture - think Nietzsche. Europe and its extension America have violently invaded and displaced people for more than 500 years, and dominated the world for the past two centuries in pursuit of wealth. The world we see now is the product of European and EuroAmerican values, priorities and beliefs. The people most responsible for the world conditions are getting blow-back from their own collective actions and creations, and they are imploding because of it. This is due to the over-valued intellectual creativity in the culture that never quite fits reality.  The culture is a failure at the most important things in life.",

Not the Saudis. Not the oil companies.  Not the Egyptian Army.  Not Likud.  They didn't want the Arab Spring in the first place.\n\nThe Muslim brotherhood won the elections. But democracy was never their agenda.\n\nSo, instead of carefully building up democracy, and the economy, inch-by-inch, they impatiently set their priority on forcing through an Islamic Constitution.\n\nIt was incredibly stupid.\n\nIt unleashed the Saudi-funded, Likud-complicit, oil-company-desired counter-revolution.\n\nIt ended the possibility of western arms, support and funding - not only for democracy in Egypt, but everywhere else the Arab Spring might have taken root - especially Syria.",

In any event, Khadr is a convicted murderer and terrorist and a traitor who built IED's and translated for the Taliban. He is owed nothing. He owes Canada an apology for committing treason. Khadr supporters are terrorists ducks with a c.",

We need to REDUCE government interference in medical care and insurance if we want affordable care and coverage, but of course, people like you who refuse to study history will insist we can't do that because we NEED government to be involved in the most intimate details of our lives.

In the sample presented in\nthis paper, those who became HIV positive, engaged in higher\nrisk sexual behaviour and reported other poorer sexual health\noutcomes tended to have had their first anal intercourse at\na younger age than other men. With the median age of sexual\ndebut continuing to decline, clinicians and other health service\nproviders, as well as researchers, need to pay particular attention\nto gay men’s earliest sexual experiences. In particular, men who\nreport having anal intercourse at a young age are likely to be at\nheightened HIV vulnerability and therefore require additional\neducation and support for ensuring a healthier sex life. Further\neducation around safer sex practices that specifically targets gay identified\nyouth may also be required to ensure their sexual\ndebut does not lead to poorer sexual health outcomes.",

It is also worth noting that Le Pen has gained significant support amongst traditionally left-wing young voters who not only suffer massive unemployment, but who also see no hope of gainful employment in the future in spite of their academic qualifications.

It is part of a history of dehumanization, of denied citizenship, and efforts to rationalize, excuse, and justify state violence. From lynchings or mass incarceration, white supremacy has utilized dehumanization as part of its moral and legal justification for violence. Spare me your reference to “White Chicks,” the Chappelle Show. Stop with your references to satire. Spare me your dismissive arguments about intent and not being racially motivated. Blackface is part of the violent history of white supremacy. If you don’t know, now you know.\"\n\nMichael, that's just one view, you can take it or leave it.

It seems now that if a black is shot and killed by police it brings immediate protesting and usually some level of rioting regardless of justification or lack thereof.  Additionally, there is no protesting when anyone of another race is shot and killed by police.\n\nTo me, this reaction is the issue that the BLM can't overcome for it to become a popular movement.  Dragging the anthem and flag into it doesn't help, I believe it to actually hurt the movement and spurs letters like above.",

Your recourse is to tax more and go into more debt, Harper had 2 years of surpluses prior to the 2008 global recession. To look at a good fiscal responsible government compare Harper from 2008 to 2015 and Obama, Harper went into debt by $3700 per capita whereas Obama (a socialist) cost every American $28,000. What amazes me is most leftys will criticize Harper for going into debt yet have no problem when PM Tater Tot lies and gives money away to others living Canadian sucking the hind teat...hypocrites",

I'm paraphrasing here, but the gist is thus:\nThe Hawaiians, post-Mahele were agitating about losing control over their lives and land, and pretty much a bunch of leadership proponed the homestead concept as we already discussed above, but with the added attitude: \"...give em their land - over there - and leave it for them to do with as they please (ancient agriculture). and THEN they'll only themselves to credit/blame for their lot, not us to blame any longer...\"\nRegardless of the original intent its validity or sentiment, my point stands: today's HHL is not original AND not helpful to broader society.",

Or let thier dogs chase it off without a clue in the world what had to come together for a successful hunt for an eagle. The eagles nest by the post office is surrounded by morons trying to get a good shot, many walk up to the nest tree. These birds built an entirely different nest next to the existing nest to get away from people. Not to mention the city of homer blows all of the trucked snow right at the nest, compacting the soil with gravel and causing the birds to panic while they are just starting to hangout by the nest.

OK, let's talk mental health ..\n\nMy opinion, for whatever two cents (more likely less) it may be worth is that Trump is a narcissistic sociopath, or at least has strong tendencies in that direction. Most likely, it's always been there, and in the business (and reality show) environment in which Trump has been operating all along, it was an asset. Considering the amount of success he's had, it certainly wasn't a detriment.\n\nNow, however, having \"relocated\" to the Oval Office, he's been unmasked. For the first time in his life, Trump is in a situation where it's not all about what HE says or thinks and it's upsetting his applecart. And the way it's manifesting is that his Presidency is becoming more and more of a Charlie Foxtrot.\n\nThe possibility of Trump being removed from office on 25th Amendment grounds is still a long shot, but less so the more he runs his mouth or Tweets from the hip.",

I have no experience with such a society, but I can see where someone might find the idea of such a society appealing.  Thousands of years of human history have proven that male-female unions raising their offspring create stable societies with the best outcomes for children.  \n\nSocieties that have incorporated same-sex acts as normal have ultimately dispensed with acceptance of them.

Peanuts has been a staple of american culture for well over 50 years.  Our parents, grandparents and great grandparents all took joy in reading these comics because they related to everyday experiences and people found that amusing.  Charles Schulz's comics represent a bygone era where sex and drugs and violence weren't issues.  There were a variety of personalities with menial problems and issues that helped shape and direct america.  Now you little brats who's parents coddle you and say \"be the change you want to see in the world\" didn't learn common sense.  All you learned was challenge authority if it makes you feel bad.

I could cite more 'promises' that have been driven over by his bus of an ego, but my real question is why his supporters don't call him on any of his 'pivots'.

Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

The difference here is that Islam is an ideology, not a race or ethnicity.

I would argue that fear of Islamic ideology is very rational and has a very well-established historical basis.

After adjusting for economic conditions, mortgage credit to the middle class went down by 15 percent. It went up 21 percent for wealthy households. Mortgage credit also has been tight for poorer borrowers, in part through the deliberate intent of the law.

Fortunately for our country, there aren't enough of them....\n\nYou consistently condemn \"the media\".....and bemoan \"The media is the only source of information most Americans have.\"  could you elaborate on this for me.....",

The Smith/Bertania Park which was supposed to be open fro 6 am to 9 pm daily, as agreed to when it was built almost 20 years ago and was foar many years, is now closed from 7 pm to 7 am daily. The Neighborhood Board wants the longer hours, but Parks and Rec won't budge. They won't say why. They won't say who gave the order.  I believe what will help parks city-wide is new leadership in the department. \n\nPerhaps Councilwoman Ann Kobayashi can hold an informational meeting on parks so residents can consolidate all their complaints in one place.

There would not be environmental contamination of oocysts if cats weren't there to shed them.  Recent research indicates that cats can become reinfected and go through add'l oocyst shedding cycles.  The oocysts are very durable and can remain viable in soil or water for 18 months or more.  In dry conditions they can become aerosolized and inhaled.

The business community reacts, gets interested. And then if you add some tax breaks, that will increase the marginal spending but it won’t make them do what they wouldn’t have done anyway. So that’s [why we need] additionality, getting firms to do what they would not have done anyway. In countries like Canada, there is too much reliance on indirect tax breaks that just make the companies richer.

The liberals should just sell it through existing LCBO outlets with a new retail law that says you can't purchase pot and alcohol together in the same transaction.

Presume you have all the files/proof close at hand?\n5. Trump said women let celebs doing anything, which in the US is true. Plus he said this  when he was a Dem. supporter/funder.

If they had prepared a more complete plan which they had seven years to construct then the CBO would have scored that. They didn't because the PPACA is their plan from way back in the Clinton days. The crap burger they submitted was thrown together so hastily and shoved out of the only two committees allowed to debate it so far that the CBO hasn't had time to fully vet the macroeconomic effects but that shoe will be dropping on their heads in the next few days.

The ordinary person is just that ordinary and he and she are the measure of what God loves and what God does, not herded.

Also endemic with the Left is a penchant for wanting to look toward a centralized, government solution to all problems. further, Left thought insists that the previous two points be underwritten with Someone Else's money.\nThat trinity of bad ideas hamstrings Hawaii.\nAnd YOU continue to vote for the same.
