It's about a cultural way of seeing reality that is rooted deeply in European history, culture and theology.\n\nWhat's happening here doesn't warrant more white naval gazing, the normal response to every failure of the culture - think Nietzsche. Europe and its extension America have violently invaded and displaced people for more than 500 years, and dominated the world for the past two centuries in pursuit of wealth. The world we see now is the product of European and EuroAmerican values, priorities and beliefs. The people most responsible for the world conditions are getting blow-back from their own collective actions and creations, and they are imploding because of it. This is due to the over-valued intellectual creativity in the culture that never quite fits reality.  The culture is a failure at the most important things in life.",

The rail will be renamed to \"Six-Flags Choo-Choo of Honolulu\" and will be pitched as the scariest ride on the planet with it's crumbling and already buckling structure under it's own weight! Investors and the ERS fund managers are all salivating to sink 100% or the ERS pension funds into the rail! Please don't let them do it! They will walk out like bank robbers!

Because it was the anti-Syrian 'rebels' that mounted the attack against the refugees.\n\nTwo days ago a deal was brokered between the Syrian government and the terrorist group al-Nusra, the group that's holding Idlib province. Residents of two Shi-ite towns in Idlib were allowed to evacuate. Their destination was Aleppo. In exchange, the government allowed residents of two towns they were besieging to flee to Idlib.\n\nBut there's no reasoning with terrorists. As the buses full of Shi-ite civilians waited outside Aleppo, an al-Nusra suicide bomber attacked them. And that's the fate waiting for all of Syria's Christian and Shi-ite citizens, should the USA's plans to destroy the Syrian government come to fruition.",

None of us remember that personally, but if you go back and study history, you discover that medical care was very accessible and affordable before the 1970s.

We need to REDUCE government interference in medical care and insurance if we want affordable care and coverage, but of course, people like you who refuse to study history will insist we can't do that because we NEED government to be involved in the most intimate details of our lives.

That is not the stance of anyone who is \"extreme right\". The ugly head that was reared is that of globalist former bankster for the uber-riche, Macron, who will impose austerity measures on the French working and middle classes if elected. It is also worth noting that Le Pen has gained significant support amongst traditionally left-wing young voters who not only suffer massive unemployment, but who also see no hope of gainful employment in the future in spite of their academic qualifications. Their lot would only worsen under Macron. If you wish to see real ugliness, take a close look at almost any globalist politician.",

It is part of a history of dehumanization, of denied citizenship, and efforts to rationalize, excuse, and justify state violence. From lynchings or mass incarceration, white supremacy has utilized dehumanization as part of its moral and legal justification for violence. Spare me your reference to “White Chicks,” the Chappelle Show. Stop with your references to satire. Spare me your dismissive arguments about intent and not being racially motivated. Blackface is part of the violent history of white supremacy. If you don’t know, now you know.\"\n\nMichael, that's just one view, you can take it or leave it.

I know to his supporters his lies somehow represent strength and character, but to the rest of us, come on! The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton maintained the most grueling foreign  travel schedule in the history of the office, is younger and not overweight as is her opponent, has released far more comprehensive medical records than her opponent, but her medical fitness is being politically questioned and slandered?

Yeah, I know, he is not constrained by his position, as the FBI director might be. But, to me, it represents very bad judgment. Anxious to give Mrs. Clinton a boost, no doubt.\n\nAs for Comey, he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If he doesn't say anything, and Mrs. Clinton wins, the Right, already pumped up by The Music Man about a conspiratorial America, would go wild when it came out - as it inevitably would. Or worse, the investigation might be leaked before the election, which would be much more explosive than anything Comey said. It's going to be difficult enough to reconcile this country after the election, without lathering that on.\n\n(continued)",

St1d made an accurate, significant list of accomplishments. Trump certainly doesn't have the support of Democrats, which is unfortunate for their constituents. Finally, Trump would be a fool to release his taxes. The public is not familiar with what such a tax return would look like. The President has thousands upon thousands of employees, former employees, contractors, on and on. Do you believe the press would be searching for some dirt among his returns? Or do you believe they want to do an accurate assessment of his overall returns? I also find an eerie similarity among the Democratic Senators on the President's first 100 days.

Instead, he repeated it.  Only after the ensuing firestorm did he comment \"sarcasm, though not too much\". ...still, of course with no apology for the accusation.\n\nOutrageous comments and actions are appropriate and expected of \"shock jocks\", reality TV hosts such as Mr. Trump and Jerry Springer, and right-wing hate-mongers such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Lars Larson.  That outrage is part of the act..without it these folks wouldn't be multimillionaires.  \n\nHowever, it's hardly unreasonable to expect more, far more from a serious candidate for the Presidency.

He was factually acquitted. You might also note that 100% of the Democratic Senators voted not guilty while both guilty and not guilty verdicts were rendered by Republican Senators.

I don't know how to explain to my children that the mean man, who exemplifies everything they've been taught about schoolyard bullies, is now being rewarded for that behavior with the highest office in the land. I'm frightened and deeply discouraged. I hope he turns a new leaf and rises to the honor of that office, but no amount of bluster and name calling from those who see themselves as being on the winning team will convince me that there is not tremendous evidence that Trump will continue to hurt and embarrass us all, likely in ways we haven't even dreamed.

This coming November, the only wall that's going to be erected for tRump is the No Wall vote to keep tRump and his kind out of the White House.  It's horrifically laughable that changing campaign staff near the end of the campaign season won't save a tRump presidency.  I saw a video with Pence participating in a town hall meeting.  An 11-year-old boy asked Pence if it's going to be his job as a vice president to \"soften\" tRumps behavior and words.  All Pence could do was stand and blink at the boy.  He never answered the question other than to say that he supports tRump.  If an 11-year-old boy (fifth grader) can figure tRump out, what's that say for Pence and Conway for criminal sakes!",

I don't have a study, but one of my 400-level hawaiian history classes' professor/doctor had us read a book that quoted early (Hawaii) white leadership/advisers as stating that the intent was to put em back they they wanted to be - old fashion cultural practices.\nThere was a much more darker side to it that earlier I didn't mention because of space limitations. I'm paraphrasing here, but the gist is thus:\nThe Hawaiians, post-Mahele were agitating about losing control over their lives and land, and pretty much a bunch of leadership proponed the homestead concept as we already discussed above, but with the added attitude: \"...give em their land - over there - and leave it for them to do with as they please (ancient agriculture). and THEN they'll only themselves to credit/blame for their lot, not us to blame any longer...\"\nRegardless of the original intent its validity or sentiment, my point stands: today's HHL is not original AND not helpful to broader society.",

Two, there is no civil right to engage in any sexual behavior you want to engage in, based on nothing but just because you feel like it.

In Wales, all signs, official notices, just about everything have to be written in Welsh....and in English. So if Barrow want a stop sign written in native language, they would have to provide the English translation right below it. That is the only fair way to do. And all of this, should come from Barrow's budget, not the state's. Inupiaq is NOT the official language of Alaska. \n\nWe are all immigrates here, some came earlier, others came late.

OK, let's talk mental health ..\n\nMy opinion, for whatever two cents (more likely less) it may be worth is that Trump is a narcissistic sociopath, or at least has strong tendencies in that direction. Most likely, it's always been there, and in the business (and reality show) environment in which Trump has been operating all along, it was an asset. Considering the amount of success he's had, it certainly wasn't a detriment.\n\nNow, however, having \"relocated\" to the Oval Office, he's been unmasked. For the first time in his life, Trump is in a situation where it's not all about what HE says or thinks and it's upsetting his applecart. And the way it's manifesting is that his Presidency is becoming more and more of a Charlie Foxtrot.\n\nThe possibility of Trump being removed from office on 25th Amendment grounds is still a long shot, but less so the more he runs his mouth or Tweets from the hip.",

Thousands of years of human history have proven that male-female unions raising their offspring create stable societies with the best outcomes for children.  \n\nSocieties that have incorporated same-sex acts as normal have ultimately dispensed with acceptance of them.

They got visited by 2 old SU-24 Jets. They were not equipped with weapons exept a small device called Khibiny. They showed up and did low altitude fly by's while simulating an attack on them. They completely shut down (blacked out) all targeting and weapon systems. Most notably they performed this maneuver 12 times on them. Absolute perfect jammed.

The study he cited as the basis for his decision has been debunked - by the very same people who did the study! Thank goodness, we have many educated, committed people and companies in this country to continue following through with clean air goals.  What Trump has done - outside of checking off one of his ridiculous campaign promises - is signal to the world that the US is not going to be a leader on this issue.  He is committing our country, slowly but surely, as an isolated country and not a country that the rest of the world can depend on.  He will NOT be able to \"re-negotiate\" this agreement.

Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

The difference here is that Islam is an ideology, not a race or ethnicity. People think that most Muslims are of middle-eastern descent, they are not (most Muslims are south Asian) Islamophobia implies a so-called unfounded or irrational fear of Islamic ideology. I would argue that fear of Islamic ideology is very rational and has a very well-established historical basis.

Police officers face an 18.5 times greater chance of being killed by a black male than an unarmed black male has of being killed by a police officer. How does that statistic figure in?\n\nPerhaps others would jump to the conclusion that the police are simply racist pigs.\n\nIn fact, we don't know if either of these suppositions are the actual reason, or if it is far more complicated.

Hitler studied them and implemented the same kind, as you  know. The injustices go to all races by colonials, to be used and discarded in the name of colonial profit. The suffering and death means nothing to thieves and muederes only profit, and Mr.Jenkins, you represent them.\nAs a vet I support the protesters, they have a right to protest, only racists, haters,  and false patriots get indignant",

That would save at least $700 million dollars per year.\n\nEliminate corporate welfare for Tesoro, Petrostar and Flint Hills, that saves another $50 million per year.\n\nEliminate the legislatures' annual sessions (and reduce the number of legislative staffers)- let the legislature meet once every two years.  Save another $50 million per year.\n\nDo NOT buy the Tajmahawker, save $32 million.\n\nDo not allow our oil to be removed unless Alaska takes 50 percent of the gross.  That eliminates the deficit by around $3.5 billion.

Justin Trudeau went on to encourage Canadians to offer compassion in considering the circumstances which may give rise to radicalization.\n\nWhen a schizophrenic white supremacist kills an anti-right protester with his car, this is construed as the first victim in the second coming of the Third Reich.

The Smith/Bertania Park which was supposed to be open fro 6 am to 9 pm daily, as agreed to when it was built almost 20 years ago and was foar many years, is now closed from 7 pm to 7 am daily. The Neighborhood Board wants the longer hours, but Parks and Rec won't budge. They won't say why. They won't say who gave the order.

The 1893 revolution was Not against a race, but a form of government that had become illegitimate, and corrupt. \nThe new Republic of Hawaii's Constitution gave the vote to the folks that had been born in Hawaii, or had become Naturalized Citizens before formation of the new Republic.\nThis is why the Polynesians under the new Democratic Republic had two thirds majority voting power, and had the majority representation in the Republic of Hawaii Legislature, and whose Speaker of the House was a Polynesian.  Polynesians controlled the vote in Hawaiian all the way to Statehood, when everyone could then vote.\nThis just exposes them as racial supremacists.

Why anyone would vote for a liar is beyond me but voting for someone that is breaking tradition really adds to the crime.  I mean if this was Hillary who refused to release her taxes, the phony republicans would be screaming their heads off.    Remember their reaction on her  emails?  Why are republicans so inconsistent?  Oh, that is right.  Its ok if you are republican.  Such hypocrisy should not be tolerated!\n\nI just think it is important to remind people that the Donald is just a liar.

Nor is there specific questions as to yard work but lots on house work..\n2)  On the same theme, Stats Can measures the value of unpaid women's work of stay-at-home parents (a very dodgy measure at that), but not the value women receive by enjoying the benefits of their spouse's income.  \nLike I said, highly political.",

As we stagger into disaster, I think Americans will start thinking the same thing because of the the swagger in his step. Macho man.  I truly don't think a lot of people know this, but Israel borders Syria - the land that has been savaged by its own leader and his opponents. Israel has has fought battle with Syria itself and I fear it may dip its wick in that disaster-zone again. And don't forget the Russians. Dirty, corrupt  Russians.

The business community reacts, gets interested. And then if you add some tax breaks, that will increase the marginal spending but it won’t make them do what they wouldn’t have done anyway. So that’s [why we need] additionality, getting firms to do what they would not have done anyway. In countries like Canada, there is too much reliance on indirect tax breaks that just make the companies richer. The point of policy is not to increase profits, it’s to increase investments.\"\n\nThis argument is grounded in the real world.",

If the Spanish Armada had succeeded, Philip would have used the  the Spanish Inquisition to destroy Protestantism in England. \n\nThat was 17 years before the Gunpowder plot. The war continued in Central Europe 13  years later when Philip's cousin, Ferdinand of Austria, attacked Jame's son-in-law, the King of Bohemia and began the 30 Years War. \n\nYou are ignorant of 17th Century history and wrong about the modern world. Islam is America's implacable Enemy, just like 17th Century Catholics were England's implacable enemy.",

Many privately run sources give you a choice if the one you have isn't run well. Government programs are all about getting votes and enriching public officials at the expense of the governed. I don't know where people get the idea government is there for the people, in this day it seems to be there only for the government and those who run it. Notice if you will how all the rules government makes, very few apply to the governing, only the people. Under the Obama administration I never felt that decisions were made to benefit me, only against me. I'm sure some think the same thing about Trump. Many private sources means choice, where one poorly run government program is all you will get. I haven't seen many well run government programs.

So it boils down to one question, who were the police concerned about turning violent? I had friends there, and the attitude of the anti-Trump folks was and is intolerant, violent and completely anti free speech. We in this Nation do not see, at least not nearly to the extent we see it from the left, an attitude of the only people allowed to speak freely or assembly peacefully is those they agree with.

The weeds shops I agree with was stupid and even letting existing weed shops sell it is idiotic. The liberals should just sell it through existing LCBO outlets with a new retail law that says you can't purchase pot and alcohol together in the same transaction.

We should have been developing our domestic economy when we had the chance\nJean Chretien might be in his 80s, but he refused to let Bush bully him into the Iraq War. He's our guy.",

Alaska should sieze all the CVRF equipment and lease it for some  real economic benefit for Alaskans.

I filed a complaint for the way they treated my mother-in-law for just being a little slow to respond to them.

Congrats on that thought process and the writing.\nHowever...\nThe part where the author says, \"too often problem solving in Hawaii is narrow minded....\"\n\nExactly.\nThis is exactly what happens when you have a single-party monopoly - any party, but particularly when it's a Left one. Any single-party system will breed a narrow mindedness. This is even more so because the single party in this case is the Democrats (Leftist). More than any other philosophy, the Left (Democrats) are more inclined to malign opposing viewpoints, engage in pop/fashionable group-think, and stomp on alternative thought processes. Also endemic with the Left is a penchant for wanting to look toward a centralized, government solution to all problems. further, Left thought insists that the previous two points be underwritten with Someone Else's money.\nThat trinity of bad ideas hamstrings Hawaii.\nAnd YOU continue to vote for the same.

I suspect that projects like the Express lane through the mountains are not even paying the cost of operation. Why was Central City able to have a four lane, ten mile highway built through the mountains for $38 million and CDOT is spending a quarter billion dollars to add two toll lanes to ten miles of C-470? Along flat ground with a wide berm?
