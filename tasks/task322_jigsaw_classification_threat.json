If the penitent does not like or agree with what the Church teaches then the priest cannot force him or her to accept the teaching, he can only point out the consequences both temporal and eternal of rejecting that teaching.\nTo say that conscience is paramount is to misinterpret the doctrine of primacy of conscience. How do we form our consciences? Basically there is something inside each of us which enables us to distinguish right from wrong in most situations. In more complex situations we Catholics have the Church's teaching authority to inform our consciences. If we are prepared to reject what the Church teaches, why are we going through this 'spiritual direction' at all?",

It's about a cultural way of seeing reality that is rooted deeply in European history, culture and theology.\n\nWhat's happening here doesn't warrant more white naval gazing, the normal response to every failure of the culture - think Nietzsche. Europe and its extension America have violently invaded and displaced people for more than 500 years, and dominated the world for the past two centuries in pursuit of wealth. The world we see now is the product of European and EuroAmerican values, priorities and beliefs. The people most responsible for the world conditions are getting blow-back from their own collective actions and creations, and they are imploding because of it. This is due to the over-valued intellectual creativity in the culture that never quite fits reality.  The culture is a failure at the most important things in life.",

Not the Saudis. Not the oil companies.  Not the Egyptian Army.  Not Likud.  They didn't want the Arab Spring in the first place.\n\nThe Muslim brotherhood won the elections. But democracy was never their agenda.\n\nSo, instead of carefully building up democracy, and the economy, inch-by-inch, they impatiently set their priority on forcing through an Islamic Constitution.\n\nIt was incredibly stupid.\n\nIt unleashed the Saudi-funded, Likud-complicit, oil-company-desired counter-revolution.\n\nIt ended the possibility of western arms, support and funding - not only for democracy in Egypt, but everywhere else the Arab Spring might have taken root - especially Syria.",

Evergreens often germinate best on bare soil, after a fire, grazing or probably ash fall, spruce are naturally spreading at Dutch Harbor from trees the soldiers planted in WWII.\nWhat about Sugar Maples, great color for tourists and start a little industry for food independence, on formally bare rivers in SE Alaska sweet clover has taken over, another nitrogen fixer and honey producer.\nIf very careful about bringing honey bees to have a varroa free population they might be able to get involved in Queen production.

We need to REDUCE government interference in medical care and insurance if we want affordable care and coverage, but of course, people like you who refuse to study history will insist we can't do that because we NEED government to be involved in the most intimate details of our lives.

The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton maintained the most grueling foreign  travel schedule in the history of the office, is younger and not overweight as is her opponent, has released far more comprehensive medical records than her opponent, but her medical fitness is being politically questioned and slandered? Let's be fair here, this is the hardest most important job in the world.",

Yeah, I know, he is not constrained by his position, as the FBI director might be. But, to me, it represents very bad judgment. Anxious to give Mrs. Clinton a boost, no doubt.\n\nAs for Comey, he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If he doesn't say anything, and Mrs. Clinton wins, the Right, already pumped up by The Music Man about a conspiratorial America, would go wild when it came out - as it inevitably would. Or worse, the investigation might be leaked before the election, which would be much more explosive than anything Comey said. It's going to be difficult enough to reconcile this country after the election, without lathering that on.\n\n(continued)",

St1d made an accurate, significant list of accomplishments. Trump certainly doesn't have the support of Democrats, which is unfortunate for their constituents. Finally, Trump would be a fool to release his taxes. The public is not familiar with what such a tax return would look like. The President has thousands upon thousands of employees, former employees, contractors, on and on. Do you believe the press would be searching for some dirt among his returns? Or do you believe they want to do an accurate assessment of his overall returns? I also find an eerie similarity among the Democratic Senators on the President's first 100 days. Dem talking points maybe??",

I'm paraphrasing here, but the gist is thus:\nThe Hawaiians, post-Mahele were agitating about losing control over their lives and land, and pretty much a bunch of leadership proponed the homestead concept as we already discussed above, but with the added attitude: \"...give em their land - over there - and leave it for them to do with as they please (ancient agriculture). and THEN they'll only themselves to credit/blame for their lot, not us to blame any longer...\"\nRegardless of the original intent its validity or sentiment, my point stands: today's HHL is not original AND not helpful to broader society.",

OK, let's talk mental health ..\n\nMy opinion, for whatever two cents (more likely less) it may be worth is that Trump is a narcissistic sociopath, or at least has strong tendencies in that direction. Most likely, it's always been there, and in the business (and reality show) environment in which Trump has been operating all along, it was an asset. Considering the amount of success he's had, it certainly wasn't a detriment.\n\nNow, however, having \"relocated\" to the Oval Office, he's been unmasked. For the first time in his life, Trump is in a situation where it's not all about what HE says or thinks and it's upsetting his applecart. And the way it's manifesting is that his Presidency is becoming more and more of a Charlie Foxtrot.\n\nThe possibility of Trump being removed from office on 25th Amendment grounds is still a long shot, but less so the more he runs his mouth or Tweets from the hip.",

I have no experience with such a society, but I can see where someone might find the idea of such a society appealing.  Thousands of years of human history have proven that male-female unions raising their offspring create stable societies with the best outcomes for children.  \n\nSocieties that have incorporated same-sex acts as normal have ultimately dispensed with acceptance of them.

Yet it has been going on for more than a billion years despite what some believe.  \nAs soon as you have evidence that convinces more than half the world's scientists to believe that humans are NOT screwing the earth over, I'll believe it.  Until then I'm going with the 97%.",

The niqab is synonymous with social regression and a lack of fundamental rights Canadians take for granted. It's not a coincidence that in every single country where the niqab is common that women are subjugated as second class citizens (often under the threat of violence). There is rich irony in defending the niqab while simultaneously raising concerns about homophobia and anti-semitism as wherever the niqab is common, the LGBT community face the death penalty for being outed and hostility towards Jews is a badge of honour. \nThe niqab is synonymous with social regression, division, and community segregation, without exception.",

Rather, you just wish they were because they are quite aware of the parts you wish to whitewash. \n\nAnd what's with the use of \"scare quotes\" around FACTS? Until Trump sat his sorry obese backside in the White House, Wilson was the biggest flaming racist the Presidency has seen in a century. Wilson WENT OUT OF HIS WAY to not only proclaim his racism but to take action to reverse the civil rights of African Americans that so many had fought and died for. Those are facts. They are not subject to your poor attempt to make nothing true and everything subject to mere opinion. \n\nWe don't need people like you trying to insert some bizarrely skewed political correctness where racists are \"some good people.\"",

This crybaby is so self-involved he didn't even think about the real stars of the celebration, the cadets. Our prez is not only a complete narcissist, he is a wussy snowflake, falling into tears whenever he is justifiably criticized. He whines, then he turn on everyone close to him and destroys their careers, blaming them for his problems. Then, he hands Israeli secrets over to Putin. This guy Trump is nuts.",

The reason the soil, water, or plant material is contaminated with oocysts is because cats are shedding them.  There would not be environmental contamination of oocysts if cats weren't there to shed them.  Recent research indicates that cats can become reinfected and go through add'l oocyst shedding cycles.  The oocysts are very durable and can remain viable in soil or water for 18 months or more.  In dry conditions they can become aerosolized and inhaled.  Oocysts can also be spread by insects or rodents from feces to food sources.",

He then instructed me to attend 10 AA meetings, which reminded me of when the North Vietnamese forced the conquered South to re-education camps if they didn't go along with the communist program. So here I was at AA meetings surrounded by people who chose to be there because they actually have a substance abuse problem.

Riiight. \nI know of what I speak, for as a young man of 19 myself, (many moons ago) I was constantly tempted by girls as young as 12! One 14 year old was extremely aggressive and did not let up until she got what she wanted- when she was 21. Most parents (and yes, I am a parent of a 21 year old daughter) are in complete denial that their little sweetness could possibly want to have, and enjoys sex! I once (when I was 31 !) was  approached by a girl who I believed to be older (at Least 18). She gave me her #. I dropped the whole thing when I discovered she was 16. \nMost parents deny these incidents occur.",

The push is to split Mr. McConnell\u2019s current BHCA bill into two bills.  One to reintroduce and vote on the same ACA repeal bill Congress passed in 2015, which was vetoed by Mr. Obama.  Once repealed then you and your liberal constituents can slobber all over the second bill for expanded Medicare expenditures robbing middle-class taxpayers.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSmith Young",

But at the same time, he seems to miss some really big things, often seeming to err on the side of clericalism. The scandal is probably as good an example of this as any.

Horgan is beholden to public sector unions and Trump's friends at the United Steelworkers - this is going to be pathetic. Mason references Carol James and Adriane Dix as capable backbenchers?

Tricked by the political rhetoric of the illusionary funding for black-oriented social programs, he turns his anger to race - when he himself is the victim of class prejudice.\"\n\n\"[He] has worked hard all his life to become a 'good American;' he and his sons have fought on every battlefield - then he is made fun of because he likes the flag. The (code word) American is overtaxed and underserved at every level of government. He does not have fancy lawyers or expensive lobbyists getting him tax breaks on his income.\"",

So he's barely in the top third ranking of a metric that he only has a small direct influence over.\n\nMeanwhile, his approval rating is dead last, ranked against all presidents in modern history.  And that's ALL on Trump. 100%",

If they had prepared a more complete plan which they had seven years to construct then the CBO would have scored that. They didn't because the PPACA is their plan from way back in the Clinton days. The crap burger they submitted was thrown together so hastily and shoved out of the only two committees allowed to debate it so far that the CBO hasn't had time to fully vet the macroeconomic effects but that shoe will be dropping on their heads in the next few days.

I've seen it climbing up and pulling down wild rose and mooseberry plants, and I shudder to think what our woods and roadsides are going to look like in another ten or twenty years if this bird vetch cannot be controlled (which it almost certainly cannot be at this point).",

CDOT has become a rogue agency which accomplishes little beyond spending huge sums of taxpayer funds on projects that achieve minimal traffic relief. It is bloated with high paid administrative positions. \n\nStop building Lexus Lanes and just widen the damn highways! I suspect that projects like the Express lane through the mountains are not even paying the cost of operation. Why was Central City able to have a four lane, ten mile highway built through the mountains for $38 million and CDOT is spending a quarter billion dollars to add two toll lanes to ten miles of C-470? Along flat ground with a wide berm? (Hint - The contractor on the job seems to have purchased an entirely new fleet of earth moving equipment)\n\nHopefully the next Governor appoints a CEO who takes CDOT in a new direction.",

He's kind of disappeared into the woodwork, hasn't he?\n\nNow, having sold out, you've been renting for the past decade, watching your rent go up on an annual basis, while those who stuck to real estate have paid off their homes, and are living mortgage free.  Makes me wonder who's really the \"angry\" guy in this scenario... if you catch my drift!\n\nSo, spare us the Chicken Little stories... we've been hearing them ad nauseum since 2005.
