        "In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question about when an event happened. Your answer should be a wrong answer. That is, if you are asked about when an event happened, you should answer with a time that the event didn't likely happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. Please try to keep your \"answer\" as simple as possible. Concise and simple \"answer\" is preferred over those complex and verbose ones."
