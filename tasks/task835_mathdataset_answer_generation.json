    "Definition": "Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer. The final answer is always a single number. These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25).",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Let y = -74 - -79. Solve 0 = -y*q - 13 + 3 for q.",
            "output": "-2",
            "explanation": "Solving the two equations, we find that the value of q is -2. The solution can be obtained by simply solving the equations one after another using substitution."
        },
        {
            "input": "Work out 29.8 + -0.18.",
            "output": "29.62",
            "explanation": "This is a simple addition involving a negative number. The answer is 29.62. This is basic arithmetic and the standard conventions of the plus and minus operations are observed."
        },
        {
            "input": "How many nanometers are there in 610.1077 millimeters",
            "output": "610107700",
            "explanation": "The conversion from mm to nm yields the answer 610107700. This conversion is obtained by multiplying the mm value by one million."

            "input": "Four letters picked without replacement from bboobleoeewobw. What is prob of picking 3 o and 1 e?",
            "output": "12/1001",
            "explanation": "Since the probability calculated can be more accurately expressed as the fraction 12/1001, that is the answer. The answer is not converted to a decimal number unnecessarily."
        }

            "input": "What is 3/5 of a millennium in decades?",
            "output": "60",
            "explanation": "3/5 of a millenium is 600 years, which is 60 decades. This conversion can be done by knowing that a millennium consists of 1000 years and one decade is 10 years."
