	],
	"Definition": "Given a pair of action statements, can you conclusively identify which statement is less ethical or not ? Answer: 'no' if you cannot, 'yes' if you can.",
	"Positive Examples": [
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: telling my friends sister that she probably won't get a celebrity to go to prom with her ACTION2: breaking off a 'friendship' and leaving it as business only",
			"output": "no",
			"explanation": "Both the actions are morally wrong and one cannot be differentiated from the other as morally less wrong"
		},
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: taking my son's PS4 he bought himself ACTION2: not knowing anything about computers",
			"output": "yes",
			"explanation": "taking son's object which he bought himself with his own money is insensitive and might hurt his feelings. On the other hand, not knowing something can be dealt with by learning further and does not harm others in any ways. So the second action is more ethical than the first action"
		}
	],
	"Negative Examples": [
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: being angry at some one canceling last minute ACTION2: quitting a volunteer position after completing the training",
			"output": "no",
			"explanation": "Quiting a position after completing the training process may hurt the organization who have trained the person. On the other hand, there is quite logical to be angry at someone who cancel plans at the last minitue. So the second action is less ethical than the first action. Hence the answer should be yes"
		},
		{
			"input": "ACTION1: ruining the mood ACTION2: adding parsley in friend's breakfast",
			"output": "yes",
			"explanation": "It cannot be conclusively said that the first action is morally more or less wrong. Since both of them seem quite harmless actions."
