    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a pair of action statements. Your task is to check if you can conclusively identify which statement is less ethical or not. Answer: 'no' if one of the statements is less ethical, and 'yes' otherwise.",

    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "ACTION1: telling my friends sister that she probably won't get a celebrity to go to prom with her ACTION2: breaking off a 'friendship' and leaving it as business only",
            "output": "no",
            "explanation": "Both the actions are morally wrong and one cannot be differentiated from the other as morally less wrong."

            "output": "yes",

On the other hand, not knowing something can be dealt with by learning further and does not harm others in any ways. So the second action is more ethical than the first action."

            "explanation": "Quiting a position after completing the training process may hurt the organization who have trained the person. On the other hand, there is quite logical to be angry at someone who cancel plans at the last minitue. So the second action is less ethical than the first action. Hence the answer should be yes."
