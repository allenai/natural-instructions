After my non-stop flight from Japan landed at YYZ, I was directed to secondary inspection at approx. 5 PM. The female CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) officer inspected all my belongings and the receipts for my purchases. \n\nAt 5:15, she started alleging that some other items (like clothing, 1 backup pair of eyeglasses, 1 pair of sunglasses) were bought in Japan, as they looked too new and clean to have been bought in Canada. Of course they did...I'm a business professional! But  they aren't that new in fact, and I bought them in Canada. \n\nI repeated that they were bought in Canada and were brought by me to Japan. She said that she didn't believe me. She  demanded proof that they were bought in Canada. I answered that I bought the clothing in Toronto and can't remember exactly where or when. I told her the name and approximate locations of some opticians that I remember. It feels unreasonable to expect weary travelers to remember details on the spot, without  records on hand.\n\nShe then got angry and rude. She said  that I was being evasive and warned me not to lie. She threatened to seize my items. She admonished that I, not she, had the onus of proving to her that I bought these items in Canada. \n\nAt 5:45, I requested politely to speak to her supervisor. She asked why. I answered that I was a little jaded from being reasked the same questions and repeating the same answers for 30 minutes. She got  more offended and ruder, when she raised her voice to ask why I thought she was wasting my time and asking irrelevant questions. I answered that I never said this at all. She said that I don't need a supervisor, if I had nothing to hide. \n\nAt 6, I reiterated my request for a supervisor, and she bitterly told me to be patient. At 6:20, a supervisor showed up, and we repeated the same questions before I was allowed to leave at 6:45. \n\nIn all, I spent 105 minutes in secondary inspection. My tone was always deferential and polite. \n\n\nWhat can be done in the future, to avoid this kind of wrangle, and waste of time?

Like kind of a trip to Europe and back but with a one day layover each way. I wonder if I would be able to re-enter the US after this trip or if I would have some problems at customs.\n\nIf not, do I have other options for traveling to Europe and coming back while having my TN expired but my I-94 valid? I was thinking of using my B1/B2 visa to re-enter the us (if that's a possibility).\n\nI checked other travel stackexchange questions and none of them are asking for the specifics of traveling to Europe with an expired TN and whether the trip is fine as long as I depart to and return from Mexico.\n\nThe whole background for my specific situation is:\n\nI'm a Mexican citizen and I've been working in the US for a few years now (always legally), my latest TN visa expired more than a year ago and my current employer filled an I-797C form to extend my working period validity (the document is listed as a TN2 class request). After filling that form, I received an I-797A âapproval noticeâ mentioning that the extension was approved and such document ha dan I-94 at the bottom valid until 2021.\n\nI have already presented my expired TN visa together with the TN2 approval notice (which has the newest I-94) to re-enter the US after several short term (less than 30 days) trips to Mexico but I never left Mexico in any of those trips. This time I want to do the same but traveling outside of Mexico in the middle of my stay, I want to do this trip, I even bought my flight tickets already but after reading different sources I don't know if I will be able to re-enter the US to continue working normally.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that, I'm planning on changing my employer in about 2 moths (after the trip) for which I would need to apply for a new TN visa with my new employer and it doesn't make sense for me to get another TN visa with my current employer (for being able to travel anywhere).\n\nI was reading this official government site and it explicitly says that nonimmigrant visa holders may be admitted at CBP if they meet certain requirements like âNonimmigrants who departed the United States for brief travel to Canada, Mexicoâ. I would technically be doing a brief travel to Mexico but not sure if I'm ok by leaving Mexico in the middle of such brief travel.\n\nIn the other hand, I was also reading this other official government site which makes me think I will actually face problems when re-entering because of the part that says â The person did not visit any countries other than Mexico or Canada in that period.â.\n\nSo I'm really confused whether I should do this trip or not (again, the total trip is only 2 weeks) because I need to be able to re-enter the US after that.\n\nIf I can't do this trip, I also believe there might be other ways of being able to travel that I'm not even aware of (other than requesting a new TN visa).\n\nAlso, I don't know if using my B1/B2 for re-entering is valid (or even recommended).\n\nSo I'm asking for people expertise in here to know a real answer on whether I can or cannot proceed with my travel plans (and any alternatives, if not).\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time to read.\n",

After that, and realizing living as an illegal was a deadend with no promisory future, I just picked my things, bought a plane ticket and departed in 1994 never to return. \n\nLong story short, after almost 25 years, now IÂ´m a professional, have a good situation and would just like to make a short vacation there. \n\nHereÂ´s my main doubt; IÂ´m not sure if itÂ´s convenient or relevant to mention my overstay when applying for a visa, considering after such a long time they may not have record of that; or do Customs keep records for that long, and could backfire me here at the Consulate, or upon arrival at the airport? \n\nI add additional information \nTo make things more interesting, I also have an italian passport. Since I am of italian descent I own the double citizenship. This passport grants me VWP, but that doesnÂ´t guarantee automatic entrance, thatÂ´s why I chose to go with the argentinian one which needs a visa.

Booked!  But I'll still check before arrival and report back for science.\n\nVery overdue final update: I didn't do a very thorough check because work, but a casual browse on Google Hotels did show a bunch of hotels offering rooms at less stratospheric prices (under $300).

Others say it is fine. Not sure what to trust.\n\nI don't have lots of time before I leave (13th of May) so will I have time to apply for one online?\n\nUPDATE AFTER MY TRIP: \n\nHere is the process that we went through whilst in Bali.\n\n\nWhen you land, before you get your luggage you will have to pass through Immigration. There will most likely be a massive queue for the FREE 30 Day Visa - you don't want this one - you want to pay for a 30 day visa so that you can extend it later. There will be little desks at which you can pay for it. The price is about $35. They give you a little piece of paper that says Visa on it and they point you to the immigration desk. A member of staff there will question your stay (standard procedure: where yourt hotel is, what you are doing here etc...). They will stamp your passport and let you though. \nTwo weeks into our stay we went to the Immigration Office located in Jimbaran. On your first day there you will need to bring with you the following:\n\n\n  2 copies of the ID page in your passport\n  \n  2 copies of the visa page in your passport\n  \n  Your passport\n  \n  Confirmations of hotels/flights (not 100% neccessary but good to have)\n\n\nAt the desk you first see, ask for a Visa Extension form. Fill it out.\n\nThere is a machine which hands out tickets. Ask a member of staff which button to press as the tickets vary depending on what you're there for and most of the options are coded with abbreviations that no-one understands.\n\nYou get your ticket and wait to be called up. They will take your documents and passport. They will then give you a day about A WEEK LATER to come back. KEEP THE DOCUMENTS GIVEN TO YOU SAFE! YOU ARE NOW PASSPORTLESS AND THIS PIECE OF PAPER IS ALL YOU GOT. \nYou come back on the given date. On this day they will ask for payment (355,000 IDR) and they will take your photo and fingerprints. You once again need a ticket and so on... You will be given some documents which get passed around the different officials you will encounter and they get stamped a couple of times. You will once again be given a return date about a week later.\nFinal day. You come to collect your passport. You go to a little side window (ask a member of staff: just say you are here to collect your passport and they will point you in the right direction). You give the forms you have. They just tell you to sit down. At this point you just need to wait and carefully listen out for your name; they are prone to mispronunciations! They will give you your passport and in the visa page you will see a new stamp that says your stay is valid until a much later date. Done!\n\n\nHere is blog post I found that explains a similar process\n",

I mean, can I arrive in NZ and ask for insurance there or won't I even be allowed out of the airport without one?\nDoes the insurance has to be for the length of my stay? I don't even have return tickets so I can't really give a date. Most insurance companies in Chile give and estimate for max of 60 days. Can I get and insurance in Chile for those 60 days and look for other insurance in NZ after those 60 days?\n\n\nI know those are a lot of questions and I'm supposed to post one question per... well, post, but they all relate to the exact same thing: what does \"comprehensive hospitalization\" means?

My question is: what are the possible ways of scam, if you agree on the price and destination in advance (e.g. by showing it on a map)?\n\nWell, I can imagine that taxi driver at the end says a higher price then agreed, but then what happens if you just give him the previously agreed price and walk away? In the answers of another related question it was mentioned that the taxi driver could deliberately \"misunderstand\" the location, but that would be covered by showing the map part.\n\nFor the sake of this question, let's consider only countries, where being kidnapped/robbed/killed by the taxi driver and such extreme outcomes are extremely rare. Say, Europe, US, and other countries considered \"safe\". (In other words, let's suppose you don't have to consider the risk that \"the taxi driver will kidnap you\".)\n\nAs answers I'm either expecting any theoretical possibility where you could be \nscammed, or even better concrete known instances of such scams (i.e. the tourist had to pay more, in spite of doing the above due diligence).\n\nOne particular example: I heard once (but not sure if it is true or not, since I can't find anything on Google about it), that a possible scam is agreeing on say \"30 dollars\" in advance. Then, at the end of the ride, it turns out that the taxist did not think about \"US dollars\", but \"some other kind of dollars\" (which of course are much more valuable then \"US dollars\"), and maybe he has even an accomplice to validate that (\"Yes, of course, in this country we always refer to XXX dollars, not US dollars.\") But as I said, I can't find anything about this, so maybe it does not exist at all.\n\nBackstory: I was in a Balkan country, waiting for the bus to the airport, together with two locals (or at least they were from some other Balkan countries). A taxi rolled up, and offered to take the three of us to the airport for an extremely low price (basically what the bus ticket per person would have cost). I double checked the price I would have to pay with the taxi driver, before getting in, but was still expecting some bad surprise when we arrived. In the end, everything went fine though, he just asked for the price we had agreed on (and besides that I willingly gave him a tip), but at this point I'm wondering what was in it for him? (The total the three of us payed was less than half of the regular fare it would have cost to get to the airport.)\nEven though I had luck this time, I still think it was foolish from me to just get into the cab, and I would like to know what else could have gone wrong. (Btw.: I used the term \"illegal taxi\" at the beginning, this one seemed pretty legal though - had the sign at the top, taximeter, etc.)\n",

I have found this website: Comboios De Portugal.\n\nA complication is that we are not exactly sure when we will get to Faro.  So, if we book ahead then we will need to play safe and book a fairly late train.  Alternatively, we could just turn up at the station and buy on the spot.  My experience with UK trains is that this is a poor strategy as the prices will be bad and we might not even get seats.  So, here is the question: which of these strategies?\n\n\nBook ahead as the prices will be better and we will certainly get seats.  Accept that we may need to hang around in Faro for a few hours.  \nJust turn up at the station.  The prices will be the same or similar and there will be little danger of no seats.  \nSomething else that I have missed.  \n\n\nThe prices on the website seem reasonable and first class is not much more so we will probably go first class.  \n\nUpdate.  I am on the train now.  It was at the platform 30 minutes before departure and it departed exactly on time.  Despite the booking site showing that it was nearly full, it is in fact almost empty.  I guess that more may get on at intermediate stops.  The carriage is nice: roomy, clean, and comfortable.  Storage for large bags is not great.  If it was actually full then it might have been a problem.  However, it is at least as good as trains in the UK.  \n\nOne minute late out of Loule and a few people got on.\n\n7 minutes late out of Tunes and it is close to full now.\n\nFinal update after quite a few trips.  Ticket buying is easy online for major routes and you do not need to print the tickets.  You will be asked for an ID number, e.g. passport, but we never had this checked.  Local trains may require old style paper tickets bought at the station. It is a good idea to book several days ahead in a busy season as the trains often sell out.  Punctuality is erratic. It seemed good at first with delays of at most 10 minutes but later we had some trains 30 or 40 minutes behind schedule.\n",

Twice to visit me (~five weeks in total); once to visit her friend (five days).\nWe've both lived in our respective countries all our lives.\nI've only stayed in Canada with her for a few days at a time.\n\nMy Knowledge\nFeel free to edit this information if any of it is misleading/incorrect.\n\nThe 180-day limitation mentioned in these threads [ 1 ][ 2 ] are for people who visit in one consecutive stay; not for totaling 180 days in the year.\nShe will be considered a resident alien of the US if she crosses the 183-day mathematical formula, as noted on this AmericanLaw website:\n\n\n  A foreign national will meet the Substantial Presence Test if he or she is present in the United States for 31 days in the current year and the sum of the following:  \n  \n  \nsum of the days present in the United States in the current year,  \none-third of the number of days present in the first preceding year,  \none sixth of the days present in the second preceding year equals or exceeds 183 days.\n\n  \n  If a Canadian meets the Substantial Presence Test but is ineligible to meet the Closer Connection Exception (i.e. since he or she is present in the United States for more than 183 days in the current year), he or she will be considered to be a resident alien of the United States. Resident aliens are taxed on worldwide income in the same manner as United States citizens.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nAre there any common limitations, mainly regarding stay durations or frequencies, that could make further visits throughout the year difficult or impossible?\n\n\nAlso, I fully understand that a visitation could be rejected for many reasons and that there's no guarantees regardless of how long of stay. I'm simply trying to avoid breaking any rules or missing any legal obligations that can come up from this international relationship. This is all foreign to meâ pun was most certainly intended.\n",

Both operate on a stored-value principle, but the fares are lower with CharlieCard than with CharlieTicket.\n\nSince I only have a few days, my instinct is that the paper CharlieTicket will be cheaper for me -- but on the other hand, during that time, I'm going to ride a lot more than the typical local, or even the typical tourist. So there's a possibility that the CharlieCard will break even for me.\n\nHowever, I can't for the life of me find anywhere on the MBTA website where it says what the price of a CharlieCard is. Without knowing that in advance it is hard to figure out where the break-even point is.\n\nDoes anyone here happen to know?\n\n(The card price may be disguised as a minimum non-refundable balance or something similar, like some other contractless transit payment card systems do, but I can't find anything about that either).\n\n\n\nBonus question: If I determine the card is advantageous for me, is there somewhere at Logan airport I can buy one at around 7pm on a Sunday?

After that, I did receive an email confirmation with all of the correct information.\n\nIt seems odd that I could reserve this room without providing a credit card, especially since their cancellation policy says they will charge for one night after a certain date. Should I be worried about the validity of this reservation, or is this practice fairly normal in Germany?\n",

Under the transit visa one is allowed to reside in a Schengen area for a maximum of 5 days.\n\n\nReference: Information about Schengen Visa\n\nI also read that If you have a valid US visa then you don't need to take an Airport Transit Visa (Same if your citizenship comes into the following cities).
