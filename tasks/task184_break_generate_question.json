    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a set of steps that are required to answer a specific question. Your job is to generate that question. Each given step refers to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.) Knowing those operations and how they appear in the input may help you generate more accurate questions.\n Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]\n Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]\n Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]\n Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].\n Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]\n Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]\n Comparative: A comparative step is used when we need to compare an attribute with a number to filter results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [comparator] [number] \n Union: A union step is used to return results of two steps together. template: Return [#step1] [or / ,] [#step2]\n Intersection: An intersection step returns the result that two steps have in common. template: Return [attribute] of both [#step1] and [#step2]\n Discard: A discard step returns result of a step and excludes result of another step from it. template: Return [#step1] besides [#step2]\n Sort: A sort returns result of another step in a specific order. template: Return [#step1] [ordered / sorted by] [#step2]\n Is true: An is true step checks a condition on another result and returns a true or false. template: Return [is / if] [condition]\n Arithmetic: An arithmatic step operates an arithmatic operation on one or more steps. template: Return the [arithmetic op.] of [#step1] [and] [#step2]."

            "explanation": "You should follow the steps in order to realize what is the asked question. In this example, the first returned entities are secretaries(based on step #1) who are born in Alabama(based on step #2). In the step #3 departments managed by step #2(which is secretaries born in Alabama. In the final steps the creation years of the departments is returned, so the question will be about the creation years of the departments. "

            "explanation": "One thing that can help you when there're lots of step references, is to follow the references in the reverse order. This example has an \"or\" operation in the final step, so the question should ask for two pieces of information. Following the steps that are referenced at the final step, you can find out what they are. For example, the #7 is #6 that arrive before noon. Following the steps like that, you will find out that the #7 is flights from denver to atlanta that arrive before noon. Then do the same for #7."
