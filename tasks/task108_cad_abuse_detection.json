An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) or Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) or Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) or Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.), indicate via \"yes\". Otherwise, response via \"no\".",

If a business becomes successful, and they can begin to afford to hire someone else to do some of the work, then they have earned the right to own their \"means of production\".

The fact that they are no longer physically labouring is irrelevant; it is a job that requires skill, experience and dedication- and one that most people are unable to fill.    The customer of the business pays money to the business owner to receive the desired product, and the worker receives a certain amount of money to operate the means of production that the business owner has worked to obtain.

            "input": "u/Elainepaige123 So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules.    My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job.    He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. He also said that I was his best friend, which is when I fell hard, because I've never had a best friend. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere.    He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better.    I asked for a better explanation, but he said, \" listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!\" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, \"alrighty.\". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood.    That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me?    or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all.    I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. He kept telling me I looked \"devastated\" the last time I saw him. I was not mentally well, because I felt like I was morally wrong. I used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person.    TL;DR guy that I fell in love with says he loves me, then dumps me after taking my virginity. Haven't heard from him since.",

When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons.    This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation.    With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding.    In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.",

Shakespeare is hard as hell for me to read and I can   only really understand what was going on by asking the people around me.     Even if you don't want to read there are some good TV shows out there that can do symbolism well. Legion on FX tells a lot of things through symbolism, it's one of my favorite shows.    If you like comics The Watchmen has great symbolism and framing. As does V for Vendetta. The Sandman comics are good, too. I also recommend Ichi the Killer if you are feeling adventurous. It is definitely NSFW/L depending on your views. Ichi is one piece of work I try to get other people to read because I still have some serious unanswered questions about things.

The emotional turmoil is strong, I'm well aware, but not being a virgin anymore doesn't make you a slut or whatever.    To me the emotional side of the story far, far outweighs the physiological slight change. A hymen maketh not the good woman.    Rape victims aren't debauched people. You've been abused, deceived, to me you're in a situation closer to having been raped than just dumped. Do not let this experience define you.    I suggest you read about the psychology of the raped person, you *weren't* raped but I think you may find info not completely irrelevant to what you're going through atm.     You take care girl, you'll be fine. Keep on going in your philosophical path, to me it's fine if you remain a believer as long as that doesn't make you hurt others or yourself.

(WRIC) \u2014 A Chesterfield family spoke with 8News Friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on South Twilight Lane the night before. The intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds.    The incident was a traumatic experience for the Lewis family's first night in their brand new home.      \"She was in to kill us,\" Melissa Lewis said. \"That was her almighty, to kill us. She attacked us and I held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as I possibly could.\"    The Lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over.    \"I said 'who are you?\" Lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. \"She said 'I need your help, please help me.' I said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'I'm the devil.'\"      The homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on July 4. The family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave.    \"She looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke,\" Lewis's husband told 8News.    Fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. With his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. None of the shots struck the suspect.    Lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength.    \"She was not stopping,\" he said. \"She had the strength of four grown men.\"    When he ran out of bullets, Lewis began throwing furniture at her. His wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. The intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the Lewis' 12-year-old son Logan, shoved a wrench into her neck.      Police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. The Lewis family left with bruises and bite marks.    \"I'm scared to go in there, I won't even go into any room by myself, I'm terrified,\" M. Lewis said.    Detectives told the family that the suspect lives nearby and will eventually be charged robbery, breaking and entering and attempted murder. She is currently in the ICU with severe head trauma.",

While I'm sure that there are trans women in \"trap\" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. In that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to \"trick\" men, so it's an accurate description. Finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.",

One reply:    > In  a communist system, there should be alternative ways for you to take  such an initiative. There should be institutions setup to make sure you  have the resources and labor power necessary to accomplish your  productive/distributive goals. This would massively increase innovation  and creativity within society and allow for the complete transition to  full communism. Until we setup these kinds of institutions, full  communism remains theoretical.    So hiring workers in a normal capitalist system isn't adequate enough; therefore government has to step in, and possibly force workers in there if necessary.     But having an \"adequate\" number of workers means that the owner no longer owns the means of production ...    That proposal is not only insanely inefficient and counterproductive, but it also provides an excuse for the government to steal the owner's stuff and enslave him or her some more.

He likes girl on top, anal, blowjobs, etc. But will not do those on hookups.    The problem I have with this is that he's saying he wants his girlfriend to put in more effort for him, than a random woman did.     Why should I do more for him, when a random woman got to fuck him with like zero effort on her part?!    I don't want to do more knowing we could've had sex without all the extras. I love oral as much as he does for example, but I don't like having different rules vs his hookups. I told him this, and he basically got angry. I'm not sure what to say next or if I'll even date him.     I like that he limits his STD risks, but I really don't like being held to a different standard than the hookups were.

I just want to go on a diet, but I promised myself I'd eat whatever I want until the end of this year, to let myself get used to this new body.

Sometimes, though, if you're unlucky enough to contribute after there's already been a huge load of responses, the OP might feel overwhelmed and unable to get to your post. So that's nothing to do with the quality of your content, and definitely nothing personal. I asked a question once that got a bunch of responses. I replied to as many as I could, being as gracious as possible, but finally just had to give up on it. I'd thought about posting a \"thank you for such a thoughtful reply!\" or something to each of the rest of them, but that almost seemed like it would be worse. Like some kind of soulless form letter bot response. Sometimes it's difficult to know what the best thing would be to do in that sort of situation, since different people will react differently to things, and you're guaranteed not to be able to please everyone no matter what you do.     Hope you keep fighting the good fight, though! You just never know when reaching out might truly help someone in need!",

My heart was so fucking crushed when I saw him the ICU, all pale, IVs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. That week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.     All in the months of May and June; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in July.    I had to re-home my lizard because I am moving and she means literally so much to me. I fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. Luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me.    I got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and I honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me.    My therapist from since I was 2 years old, has cancer. It rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance.    During this entire year, I think I've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. I want to get help, but I also don't want to necessarily stop altogether.    So basically that was my year (so far). I have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. I mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (The most being my father's near death experience).    Thank you for reading and I hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019",

He had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. It was broken. It was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. IT WAS BROKEN. IT WAS FUCKING BROKEN. His doctor stole him a new one (A DOCTOR HAD TO STEAL A MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICE IN ORDER TO TEND TO HIS PATIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT LONG AND HARD), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. And anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him.    He worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. Don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. HE CONTRIBUTED. HE CONTRIBUTED YOU FUCKING FUCK. You're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? If you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. It doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. THE FUCKING DEATH PANELS ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOUR CADILLAC PLAN WILL DENY YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED SOME DAY FOR SOME BULLSHIT REASON AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE YOU SELFISH SHORT-SIGHTED JACKASS, YOU WILL FUCKING DIE. I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish.    My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick \"support the troops\" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're \"okay\" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back.    I hate these people who act \"woke\" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as \"racist?\" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE.    I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \\*gasp\\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience.    But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge?    I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us.    There is no hope. There is no one coming to the rescue. Everything and everyone will die and rot.",

I can't link names anymore because I don't want to get suspended for mentioning this user *again*, but I had a very high karma thread here removed by the Anti-Evil team that posted a PM conversation between me and [highest karma user] where he outed himself (jocularly or not) as a paid advertiser for companies, etc., and well...    I got suspended for seven days for \"Harassment\".    Today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. My appeal was simple. There is no harassment if someone messages **YOU** and never ONCE indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. That very clearly means they WANT to keep talking to you.    Not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! In fact, the last PM I had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the Reddit admins) falsely suspend me.    Posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever.    tl;dr: Do **NOT** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. Reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. An appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said \"stop talking to me\" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.",

Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'?    It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.  I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide.    Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is \"Get help.\"?  What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced?  It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy.    I know how to fight this.  The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need.    When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked.  The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset.  Beside that, I'm just a blank face.  A mere statistic.    Believe me.  Seriously.  Believe me.  I'm not yanking your chain.  I know how bad suicide is.  You don't need to remind me of that.    I can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but I can state my opinion and so, I have.   ",

            "input": "There is nothing remotely racist about this post.     Blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... But, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of America. Also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. Therefore, I suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in North America, probably less than 1% of them are black.     Why bring this up? My point here is that Bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. This may provoke certain responses by a Sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as:    1. Confusion;  2. Fear;   3. Trepidation; and  4. Curiosity    I believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage.  All of these potential responses will cause a Bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not.     The fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. Chances are better than not that when a Squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. It may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare.    As a practical matter I think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. See how the Squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. I am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so I will be very interested to see the results.     There are all sorts of variations on this concept. The goal here is to throw a Bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. The idea is to create a weird scene in an area where Bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. At the same time, you want it to perplex the BF to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. While this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the Sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head.     Here are some other ideas I have to cause a Bigfoot to pause due to confusion:     1. Outdoors sex/orgy: Get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a Bigfoot hotspot. This will really pique a scratch's interest. At some point a Squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out!     2. Poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. It probably will take longer to attract a Squatch.     3. Strange looking people: these are people that Squatch are not used to seeing. For example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins.     4. Fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. The noise and weird scene will generate some Bigfoot interest.     Some believe that Sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. I think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. Confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. Therefore, we take the Squatch's advantage away from it. This will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.",

They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some \"forced diveristy\" issues that has [completely tanked their sales](https://youtu.be/9CnTDE2zZU0) (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.    More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh](https://youtu.be/ZA_DNrV6izw). Even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which [she has been accused of before](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/brie-larson-basmati-blues-white-saviour-role-attack-criticism-actress-india-cinema-a8057001.html). Gotta pay those bills though, I guess.    The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive \"incels are back to ruin CM\" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.    The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider \"woke\". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the  \"SJWing\" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels.

I don't think you are a loser :)    I think by making this post it shows you do want to change, and by having regret over not doing things at the end of the year it shows you want to change as well. That is important, if you don't really have the drive to grow, then you aren't going to.     I don't know where you live, but perhaps there is a community center, or a park? A place for you to walk? Going to a center or a park where there are people could help you make friends, and get exercise as well. If you don't know how to break the ice with someone, giving them a compliment might work, or asking them a question about something they have with them (like, \"oh that's a cool phone, what kind is it?\"). Take the conversation from there (if they seem comfortable with the confrontation). You can't make friends if you don't put yourself out there at least a little.     I also don't know your interests, but go to places where you can find people with similar ones. If you go to a store that has things that interest you, even talking to the employees could help. They probably have an interest in the thing too, and they have to be welcoming to customers, so it is good practice to try talking to them if you are still uncomfortable with the idea of making friends. Also, chatting with people online leads to more practice as well as online friends that can be there for you!    For losing weight, start simple. Don't tell yourself you are going to start going to the gym everyday if you don't think you will, and don't feel bad for knowing how much you can or can't handle. Again, I don't know how chubby you are, but you know yourself. Take a walk everyday, introduce one healthy food into your life (or take away one unhealthy food) every week if diet is a problem for you. And let yourself have a cheat day, it can help you in the long run. If you are scared to work out in public, buy some weights of your own and watch some Netflix while lifting them. Make it somewhat enjoyable so you stick with it, so ooh don't get discouraged for not wanting to follow through. I believe in you!     Good luck to you, friend :D",

About 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, I meet someone who seems to just click with me.    No name but a letter. Anime pic. Everything should have told me this is a catfish.    But I was so fucking lonely.    It comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on Runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier.    The catch? I had to give them the 7 bonds I had already, because \"It'll be a better gift if I give you all 20!\"    Of course I do so without thinking.    Trade complete.    B has left the clan. B has logged off.    I'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen.    This must be a prank, right? No one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right?    10 minutes pass. I haven't moved. One of my friends PM's me \"Why are you on that world?\"    All I could manage to say was \"I don't know.\"    I'd just gotten scammed because I was thinking with my dick.    I can't show my face to my clan anymore. They'll never let me live it down. I can't handle that. I'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. Not the completely broken mask that it actually is.    So I left. Never logged in again. On anything. Totally off the grid save my job.    A month goes by. My phone blares notifications at me... \"Naive we miss you.\" \"Naive, hope you're okay.\" \"Naive what happened?\" \"Naive we're really worried.\"    Lies. All lies.    About a month and a half ago, I finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. I just tell her right out I'm depressed. She prescribes me 200mg Bupropion, twice daily.    So now I'm on medication for depression. Doesn't feel like anything.    Until 3 weeks ago.    All of a sudden, I'm a completely different man. Garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. Came back to my clan ecstatic. Things are looking good for once.    Except when you didn't agree with me.    Then I was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. Because how DARE someone try to harsh my happiness?    So I treat them like I would any other asshole. I mocked them. I poked fun at all the words they say. And when they inevitably fight back, I get underhanded. Start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence.    Of course they respond in kind. And then I played the victim. Dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument.    Oh I won the arguments. But now the entire clan hates me. They don't even acknowledge me when I speak in the clan.    I've become *that* guy. The one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off.    I've become the crazy one.    I'm not fixed. Sure I'm no longer depressed.    But I've never felt more isolated than I do in this very moment.    They just wrote me off. I can't blame them. No one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked.    No one wants to hear out why I'm saying the things I say. No one is acknowledging that I said I need another break from Discord. No one cares.    So I left. Again.    I shouldn't be around people. I'm trash. Filth. The worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right.    Don't end up like me. If you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.    Don't be the reason your friends give up on you. You'll regret it so much, like I am now.",

Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or \"congenital eunuchs\". In 19th and 20th century medical literature, intersex was referred as true hermaphroditism, female pseudohermaphroditism, and male pseudohermaphroditism reflecting the first taxonomic efforts to classify intersex conditions. These terms are no longer used: terms including the word \"hermaphrodite\" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious.    ***    ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]  ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.       #**\u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5 (THE HYPERBOREANS COME AND BRING THEIR SHIT)**    Now we will be talking about the Hyperboreans, are the One's precious pet project to spite the Demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the One. The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen. But they didn't know that did they? They used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of Nazis, literal Nazis, the Nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course.    #**\u05dc\u05d6\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05d9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd (FUCK THE HYPERBOREANS)**    The Hyperborean Empire of theirs, their little Astro-Reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the Demiurge is victorious. They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.    #**\u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (THE HYPERBOREAN REMNANT)**    Oh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the Hyperborean Empire! They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.    #**\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)**    Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning.    #**\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)**    The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right?    #**\u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4\u05d9 (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)**    Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late.    #**\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05e0\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2 (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)**    I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right?    #**\u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)**    This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge.     #**\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)**    This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.    ________    #**\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 \u05e0\u05e6\u05d7\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc (LET IT BE SAID LET IT BE DONE FOREVER AND FOREVER FOR ALL THAT IS AND WILL BE PRAISE DEMIURGE PRAISE THE ARCHONS)**",

If risk of birth defects in children makes incest wrong, does that mean it's wrong for people with dwarfism to have sex?    Same thing goes for power dynamics and grooming.  These are problems independent of incest, and ones aren't inherent if you're talking about similarly aged cousins or siblings.

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

But capital doesn't even really give a shit about immigration, look at how quickly the billionaires lined up behind Trump. What is important to them is their ability to shift capital to tax havens, not increasing the net labor in the United States. They are just glad you are distracted.    But capital isn't interested in building factories in poor countries. It is only interested in stripping them of their resources to prop up the imperial core. Net flows of capital from the global south to the global north are over six trillion a year. Yes that includes the foreign aid, the small pittance that you begrudgingly hand out and expect oh so much gratitude for.

All anyone has by way of proof are 2 screenshots and OPs word. Supposedly the CEO (or whatever, unsure if his title) answered in the thread- sort by controversial and it's like 3-10 comments down- but he *seems to* talk quite similar to OP.     I'm not saying that it's 100% that the op is lying but this looks, sounds, and **feels** really off to me and I think it bears watching. Though it may not matter as they're review bombing the business ([and review bombing the wrong business location in some cases](https://imgur.com/a/bKLaVNP)).That's super important as these are franchises, they don't own all the businesses that have that name. They've also ran them off almost every single social media platform they're active on.    Fwiw I've reported to the mods and they got back to me quickly and told me they'd take care of it. (I sent a pm w my report) Im trying to message the admins but I'm on the Reddit app and I'm unsure how to do that, or if there's even a \"contact admins\" button. I can't really blame the mods if they didn't know it was going on and that thread if a mammoth, it's huge.       Thoughts? Feelings? Ideas? Am I way off?

I was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse.    Something clicked  a couple months ago. I think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. I figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. I decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away.    Back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. When i started, i absolutely hated it. But i kept going to the gym every day, and got stronger and stronger which led to today, i was finally able to do 2 full range of motion pull ups without any kind of resistance band or kip up!    Im really proud of myself for this. Im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve. Just a couple months ago, i was a fat stereotypical asian gamer lookin dude. But a couple days ago, i got complimented on my new (albeit chunky) muscle definition, and goddamn it feels good!    Its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. I still stress eat and sleep too little. I still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. But its baby steps, ya feel? Slowly but surely, im improving myself!    Its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. It really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. Its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal.      Sorry if this is braggadocious, im just really proud of how far ive come! :)        P.S. if anyone has any tips on eating clean then please help me out! Anything is appreciated :)",

            "input": "Many stupid people are using the misquoted and invalid 40% statistic, so here goes. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

Spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime.     >    > The first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. These actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the FBI uses called \"Crimes Against Society.\" Vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation. The aforementioned swastika spray paint is no more difficult to clean off than a person scrawling their name.     >    > Digging further, the increase in reported hate crimes is driven primarily by these non-criminal acts.     >    > The disparity between real crime where people are harmed or property is irreparably lost and simple misdemeanor activity is staggering.     >    > An indicator hate crime isn't a problem is the rise of the hate crime hoax.

One doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen. But one does need to raise awareness if they wish to have their 15 minutes of fame.     >    > [As I previously noted](https://mises.org/wire/combat-hate-make-government-weaker), the number of people who buy into hate ideology, regardless of motivation, is so trivial that they couldn't even fill a minor league baseball stadium. There are more people than this who think the Earth is flat, yet no one considers that a growing trend. It would be impossible to casually talk about Nazis being evil if they had any semblance of power or authority as people would tread more carefully. Being anti-Nazi is a safe and easy way to win social points since there is almost zero risk of reprisal. Just ask Wilfred Reilly, who is on actual enemies lists, just how dangerous they are (they aren't).

Instead of encouraging such behaviors, people should encourage them to get  the necessary medical help.    On top of that body positivity should be embracing your natural body type. Whether it be a pear, banana, apple, hourglass or etc. Fashion designers make different styles that cater to different body types. Its ridiculous when people get upset when an outfit doesn't look good on them, when its not for their body type to begin with. Embracing their body type is the best way to figure out what makes them look beautiful. Like wearing a size 4 when they're really a size 14. Not only do they make themselves look bad but it gives them a harder/very uncomfortable time forcing themselves in spanx and corsets. Do yourself a favor and wear clothes that work for you, don't wear it just bc its what so and so wore or its what society wants. Everyone is beautiful or handsome in their own unique ways.

Born in Atlanta, King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, tactics his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi helped inspire.    King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and in 1957 became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).    ***    **Civil rights movement**    The civil rights movement (also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms) in the United States was a decades-long struggle with the goal of enforcing constitutional and legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already enjoyed. With roots that dated back to the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, after years of direct actions and grassroots protests that were organized from the mid-1950s until 1968. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation, disenfranchisement, and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection for all Americans.    After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved.    ***    ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]  ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

She mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash.    Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin.    Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.     If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level.    **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from \"unconditional love\" to \"social contract\" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. If you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.",

In an urban environment, cover and concealment are everywhere, so the first shot may likely be the only clean shot you get. The ballistics of the 10mm Auto out of a 6.02\" barrel are almost unrivaled in semi-automatic pistols, and at 100 yards it's still going plenty fast to properly open the hollow-points I use, and it has a flat trajectory so I barely have to compensate for drop.

And then it turns out that whole narrative was false. In fact, Trump was paying more than Obama. Neato.    It didn't deter many of those in that sub, however. And the more radical they got, I'd still try my best to have a discussion, but before I knew it, I was being labeled a racist neo-Nazi Trump supporter. Got real fucking tired of it.    So I went over to T_D, outright stating I didn't care for Trump and voted Sanders. And you know what? They were cool with it. Why? Because I was chatting with them in *good faith*. I wasn't yet another asshole joining their subreddit to call them Nazis and whatever else. Surprise, surprise, they were all (well, mostly all) happy to have rational, level-headed discussions. We could disagree with each other and still be kind.    That was when I realized I had been blatantly lied to the whole fucking time. And it shouldn't be a surprise--they're people too.

Straight razors give the best shave, oldschool safety razors give the most economical one, and modern razors give both the worst and least economical shave, so what's even the point of such a thing? I used to use a Gillette Mach 3, and thought it was the bee's knees, but my single-bladed, double-edge 1901-style butterfly safety razor, the same style that my father and stepfather both first learned to shave with, the same style that my grandfather used up until he was no longer able to shave himself, the same style that my great-grandmother used to shave her legs (we found one in her house when she passed. We also found her medical anti-hysteria device. That was slightly traumatic).    Now, I'm not in the camp that says \"if it's older, it's clearly better,\" but I am of the camp that says \"don't always assume that newer means better,\" because sometimes changes are made for the better, and sometimes they're made for the sake of making changes.

If I'm not mistaken there are websites that people advertise their places to rent out rooms designed specifically for college students  not on campuses just random people advertising I've looked into it before for my country, so pretty much you would be sharing a place with other people but you have your own space ofc with people who r in college as well which could be a good thing to look into not just for the moving out aspect but you also could make some friends idk.     I'm glad to hear she did at least try and can see he went way way over the top. Maybe try talking with her 1 on 1 so maybe since she has experienced similar feelings in the past she would be more understanding of your perspective and how serious it is and that you do need support.     A few comments said that you need to cut ties the toxicity in your life but at the moment that is more or less impossible and would cause too much grief for you and they are a part of your support network and that's something that is important to have (a support network) and maintain. I think your dad is just confused and doesn't know how to handle just mental health on a whole maybe having a heart to hear with your mum could help her help him to learn more about this kinda stuff so he can help you because I'm sure all he wants is to help you but just doesn't know how to, and maybe he is struggling aswell and just doesn't know it properly sand doesn't currently have the mental capacity needed to take proper care of you. There are so many things that could have attributed to his his actions that have nothing to do with you and could be a case of poorly directed and understood emotions, Has he been under any stress or pressure at work?, Unexpected bills, a loss of a loved wrong?, problems at home or job security? , or maybe him seeing you at the age you are taking steps into college has him thinking of the past or whatever and that's gotten him down(like him not being where he'd like to be in life idk I'm not a councillor). Idk sorry you said like everything was lovely before so I'm trying to think about what could be the underling cause for why he reacted in such a horrible way, I'm sure he regrets what he said and feels bad for it. I hope he does. And I hope he will come around soon and acknowledge what he said and apologises to you. Sorry I hope you get what I'm trying to say.    But above all you need to look out for you and trying to protect your mental state is most important so if that means ASAP moving out work towards what you have to do to achieve that so you can at least get that space to become level headed which in turn will help you be able to feel better. And hopefully fix and build a healthy relationship with your dad if you do decide that it is something you want.       It will be hard, you will have feelings to end it all, you will want to give up and it will feel pointless. But I promise you that it won't be worth it. You will struggle your entire life. Everyone does in their own way that's just the sad 'shitty' fact of life. But as life goes on you build experience of dealing with the shit life throws at ya and get better at coping with your thoughts and feelings and someday in the future you will be faced with a problem and then think back and think to yourself \"wow if X was a problem 2 years ago that would have been enough to make me tie the rope there and then. But it's a problem now and I'm okay\". And that's something you will be happy to acknowledge that you have progressed in yourself and all the suffering we go through conditions us to who we are going to be in the future like for example if in the future you become a parent I have no doubt you will be a amazingly supportive and loving parent because you will understand what it's like to feel certain feelings.    Sorry I'm on phone so terrible formatting and what not I truly hope for the best for you OP please take care of yourself and I hope you can see what I'm trying to say please let me know if there is something I said that doesn't make sense or worded wrong. If you find yourself needing someone to talk to feel free to msg me I'm happy to talk.    Edit: fuck I typed a lot sorry",

Several historians consider the \"reign of terror\" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September, June or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place), but there is a consensus that it ended with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794.Between June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.    ***    ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]  ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

You had these huge families where everyone was related to at least one person, and that's ended up inescapably propagating down the line because most people are still living and marrying in the same part of the state their ancestors were. It's also why the LDS church keeps a huge geneology database - back when it was established they were trying to figure out who was related to who.    Anecdotally my brother married a distant cousin without realizing it (their kids are fine fortunately), and I've got some other cousins who are having a lot of children with cleft palates and hip dysplasia problems, and I suspect they're probably related on some level as well. 2-3% increase in birth defects doesn't seem like it's so bad until you see it happening to people you know and you see the pain and  the costs.    That said, they have every right to keep having kids as is the mormon wont, and they'll just keep paying for the surgeries on infants. I suppose it's similar for other people who find they're both at an increased risk for deformity even without the ancestral relations.        https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/31/us/by-accident-utah-is-proving-an-ideal-genetic-laboratory.html",

You say, \"no thanks\", and negotiate with another provider, who gives you a bill of $500, and you choose to pursue that treatment.    I'm assuming that there would be multiple \"healthcare providers\", i.e., those who procure actual healthcare products and services, not insurance companies (who I assume would be eliminated by Medicare-for-all).

I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home.    One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that.    He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him \"go home. You have a kid.\" He told me \"I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you.\" He said he didn't do all this for anyone.    Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens.     But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen.    Before I left, he told me \"the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music.\" Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself.     It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise.    I love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and I will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. It's more than that. He saved me.    Thank you. If you're out there somewhere.",

Some lines of code are more important or more complex than others, other times many lines of code can be nearly the same thing written over and over again.  Someone who checks over the code to fix any errors to be sure it compiles or just clean it up to make it easier to read for when other people will work with the code in the future may have zero lines of codes attributed directly to them, but is still an important part of the project.

Lots of stress from my job, lots of stuff coming up soon. I just don't feel secure anymore. How could I not have fun in a room with my closest friends?

I chose to leave because it made no sense that a post that didn't break the TOS and was well received by the majority of the community would earn a punishment. When certain forum members started sharing details that should've remained within the four mods...I bounced because it was clear that information was being shared with non-mods, but friends of mods.   In fact, I was happy to stay quiet and allow bygones to be bygones until I noted that the person who created the most drama was running her mouth in other places trying to bad mouth me.  Whatever ,it's reddit, but there's not enough time in the day to dedicate yourself to silencing someone because you want to be snarkier than everyone else.  I wish that forum nothing but good things and I'm disappointed it went down the way it did.",

The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pa.    This is what I had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, I hadn't seen the specific vote counts. That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that \"nobody supports them except those in the group\" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.     I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses \u2014 find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that \u2014 it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.    ^just to be clear, this is in a generic \"you\", I'm not accusing you of any of this    > hit in the head with a baton or bat    I hope it's clear that I don't condone this whatsoever. And this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation.    > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does.    But in order for this to be at all relevant \u2014 you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that I linked. Again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? Or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories I linked?    I'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions.    > The difference between supporting assholes.    Do you think all assholes are created equal or something? Would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child?        People don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. You can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. Just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral.

I think that's fair, but that seems like more of a pragmatic argument to put prohibitions on it than a moral argument against its practice.  It seems to me like at the end of the day the issue is still that by having sex two relatives increase the risk of health problems in future generations.  This effect is compounded by successive generations of incest in a way that could be *especially* harmful, but idk it seems to me like if you're going to argue that incest on the whole is immoral that need to apply to individual instances and not just multigenerational practices.    > Though on a related note: This movie is hilariously bad.

I've known her since sophomore year, and now we're both seniors. I'm graduating in 2.5 months, but she's staying for a 5th year. Most of my friends are juniors or staying for a 5th year, so it's going to be really tough for me to leave my friends behind. My college friends are like my family.    I've also helped C through a nasty breakup with one of her previous girlfriends. Because of this, I was happy for her when she got her new girlfriend last year, but now I think things have gotten weird.    She literally spends all her time with her girlfriend. Like always. Even though C lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and I know this pisses off C's actual roommate. C's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in.    C has just gradually stopped talking to me. She even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. Sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on Facebook and I'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read.    Sometimes, I'll see C's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if I've ever heard from C, because they haven't. Because of this I know this isn't something C's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends.    I'm happy that C is happy in her relationship, but I'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before I leave campus. I haven't seen her in months, and I'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, I may not see her again before I graduate    **Thanks for reading.

Theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. This is the same basic recruiting tactic that ISIS uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic.

This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \\*19 Kids and Counting\\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \\*Counting On\\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive.         This subreddit drama focuses on r/DuggarsSnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the Duggar family. However, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes \"leghumping.\" Leghumping is fawning over or praising the Duggars, which is not allowed on the sub.

Chal mann liya hui, to ek baat bata ki kitna mismanagement tha UPA me ki tum EVM nai save kar paye.    Aur sunn, law ki bhi baat kar lete h thodi si. Search karna bankruptcy code 2016, yaa 269st, sec80-IAC of income tax act. Invits and reits seach karna aur us se related tax laws bhi.    Thoda gyaan le le tu mere se. DDU-GKY, PMKVY search karna.

I was a teenager in the time before cell phones (my parents had a car phone) and the internet (I could use my 2400 bps modem to call into local BBS systems) and I hate to sound cliche but kids were a hell of a lot better adjusted.  If we wanted to talk to someone we actually had to talk to them and there was no drive to impress (or bully) our peers on social media.    A kid under the age of 16 doesn't need a cell phone, nor do they need unrestricted access to social media.  Sorry, they just don't.  At 16 you're much closer to being an adult than a kid and you gain the ability to drive so a cell phone isn't a terrible idea.      Sorry, but I think we're raising a generation of kids who will be damaged by the internet, OP is just one example of that and so is the related post talking about the kid who thinks they are trans.",

Reporting on police misbehavior drives clicks, reporting on police *good* behavior does not, so whatever you see on the news is always going to give a much more bleak view of the police than actual statistics will, even if there is variance between cities in terms of the percentage of police interactions that go poorly, which there *always* will be.  This is one area where 'equality of outcome' will never happen, no matter how hard you try.",

If there are dramatic happenings around the takeover, please make a self post and include links to drama that users can read.

I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect \u2014 and safe \u2014 release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15.    Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test \u2014 I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.     I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.     I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things \u2014 namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem.    Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn \u2014 streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.     A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing. The next time I see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes.     I'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like I'm done hiding from the world. I don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. My mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. Telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. Thanks for reading.    tl;dr: Masturbated daily for twenty two years, used it as a crutch to avoid my anxiety, ran my social life into the ground, but fuck both of those things now. I'm in therapy and I'm gonna go out there and get mine.",

The same way even the political and other more divisive subreddits were about the subject itself.    Even if /r/Socialism was run by a socialist and /r/Capitalism by a capitalist the purpose was not to create a community of socialists or capitalists but discuss the subjects, events and happenings concerning them.    Today almost no sub is about about discussing it **but being part of it, being supportive of it, being loyal to it.**  (Exceptions for like \"True, or Truetrue subs).    This is why TD bans even supporters of **Donald Trump** when critically analyzing the presidents actions in say his ever more hawkish appointments.     Or why various socialist subs ban outright **socialist members** for lifting the issue in Venezuela from a critical point of view.    Or even why the mods in /r/Food will ban you for criticizing someones food, or notion of food or beauty or taste of food.     The concept of what a sub is about has changed. Or rather what a sub is *for*. Subreddits are no longer divisions of topics but divided communities.     I remember on one of my older accounts one of my first banishments was in a subreddit for something literally called \"/r/soylent\" (from the movie Soylent Green) and rebranded as something positive. I was absolutely downvoted and then banished after a prolonged discussion (with little give and take) and I've seen this mannerism now spread to all sectors of Reddit.     We either need to change this very fundamental of perception in ourselves or we must accept that even completely benign and neutral subreddits like say /r/News or your local subreddit will be taken over by a particular group and that group will congregate around their definition of the subject and then proceed to isolate voices that do not adhere to that as it progresses to define itself, whether openly or subconsciously.       We must rethink what we use reddit for or concede that this is the future.          ____      A way to stop this would be to change a fundamental concept of Reddit. To forbid subreddits from having selective enforcing based on any stance on any one issue.     So you could talk as much shit about socialism as you wanted in a socialist sub as you could talk shit about capitalism in a capitalist sub as long as you followed the rest of the subs rules.     I honestly think that it's either this or we might as well shut up about it, because organic change might not come about as all the subs are now protecting themselves against brigading and \"concern trolling\" and other such things the same way an arms race in real life functions. So either make them all bend the knee or the struggle is pointless. But at least we can come to a common understanding of why it is happening, hence this thread. This way we can also stop acting out as victims of a particular ideology, religion, sex, location, interest or what ever when we get banned.  We are victims of one side of Reddit, nothing else, sadly.",

Functionality wise it's pretty cool though, like Reddit but more like a blog site, so you can have pictures and video in your post (think instead of image and self post it's the two combined kind of like a html document).    It's run on a cryptocurrency where the upvotes and karma actually add up to a payout. Naturally it is now 99% bot abuse and karma farming and the shittest shitposts you've ever seen, 1% actual users posting legitimately cool art stuff and of course circlejerking over this week's popular shitcoin.    The big draw of it, that is both also a huge disadvantage, is that no one can physically delete anything. It can be downvoted (\"flagged\") into oblivion and the frontend can be set up to expunge stuff below a score though, and there is no one there to intervene when someone does that. So that makes for a kind of shit culture where people are scared to upset the power users who can drop a -10 dollar flag on your post, or make a bot that auto flags everything. The idea of it is though that it's a monetisation model where the act of voting does a blockchain thing that makes more of that coin, and you get money from it (and the voter gets some as well called curation). In theory yeah that's great, in practice you need literally millions of upvotes from small steem power accounts to amount to anything, and there is nothing stopping some bully from running an account that does nothing but auto flag all submissions by someone.

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

It's not like Epic is providing a better service than Steam. In fact, if you look at their capabilities, they are providing a lesser service (with less functions). The game and the content is the same. All of the benefits are for the developer. I mean if we look at the situation with taxis and ride shares, it's clear where the consumer is getting a better deal. So realistically, it's just an unpleasant situation but no unexpected. It's a business first and they go where the money is.     That being said competition is healthy when it drives businesses towards improvements. But that's not what Epic is doing right now. They aren't even addressing the consumer, which is evident by their store being so unfinished. They are addressing the developers. Once they have amassed enough clout in the business, they might start offering benefits to customers but right now, it's not about the public. It's about the gaming development industry.    I'll freely admit I never buy a game at launch. It has nothing to do with it being buggy or something like that. I just don't have the money.

The issue is that is almost never how incest arises. Even between cousins/siblings, it's *at best* a result of social isolation, codependency, maladjusted social interactions, or shared trauma. This is why incest is so maligned - even when the incest itself isn't abuse, it is a huge indicator of a seriously troubled situation/people. Which isn't to say it's always \"morally wrong\" to *do* so much as it is the outcome of a morally wrong/unhealthy situation. So most people don't bother delving into the details of it and are fine with incest just continuing to be wrong.
