An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) or Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) or Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) or Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.), indicate via \"yes\". Otherwise, response via \"no\".",

I've always been friends with different types of people and it sounds like you have too.  There's the people I want to go out with, there's the people that make me laugh so hard I throw up (truestory), there's the people I go to when I feel like shit or need advice, the people I can have really deep conversations with, etc.!  Ofcourse some of these overlap, but in the end you have friends because they fill a certain role in your life, and I think that's beautiful. Sometimes you want to hang with the one person, and sometimes you don't, and that's okay :)   To me, it would be the worst to have one person you depend on the most. But that's pesonal.    The second point I want to make is that this could be an important moment in your life: the friends you have now, you won't want to have for the rest of your life either. You'll move away from each other, grow apart, or take a different path in life, and that's all okay! Maybe you and your current best friend will grow apart. But you'll find new friends, in the weirdest places, that you have the best connections with. It's okay to lose people, in a while you'll be happy for them that they've found their way in life.     And if you really want to be someone's best friend, someone with whom you share everything, someone that you trust completely, that won't ever backstab you: you will. If it's not right now, it's yet to come :) it has nothing to do with who you are, everyone is weird and you'll find the right level of weirdness to match yours.

Both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points.    The idea of Piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. Think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. The idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. Along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs.    Where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is \"a number of people\". As we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. They may not even be a large portion at all. For example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on Steam. They're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. And they're using the fact they don't want to support the Epic Games Store as a moral excuse.     Essentially, they are valid points, assuming the \"lost sale\" defense is based in reality which I can't comment on. But a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. Instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.",

I now know he doesn't care about me, but his still MY best friend. We used to talk everyday, now if he doesn't see me during school hours, he doesn't even send me a message. If I don't look up for him or talk to him, he just ignores me. I have come to think he grew tired of being my friend, as everyone I know. This always happens to me. Nevertheless, I still want his friendship and his approval, even when he has done me so many bad things. Some days it looks as if I'm really his best friend, but other days, he completely ignores my existence. It's just too much. I feel too much, and I always overthink too much.

But she always answers, so I guess she is at least a tiny bit interested in talking to me. Otherwise she'd already have ghosted me. However, I do recognise that I might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then.    I went to a therapist back when I was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. She ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. I'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one I went to during my life. I went to one when I was 5, another one when I was 12 and another one when I was 14. Neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue I faced at the time (I don't quite remember why I went when I was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).     Last year I thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (I got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but I couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so I couldn't do anything about it.    I don't know if I like anything about myself. I'm a good friend, I guess? Back when I had friends I always stood by their side and always listened to them when they had some sort of problem. But I don't know... I was always the one initiating conversations & when I decided to let them start one I never heard from them again.    And about my life... I don't know.

            "input": "There is nothing remotely racist about this post.     Blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... But, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of America. Also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. Therefore, I suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in North America, probably less than 1% of them are black.     Why bring this up? My point here is that Bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. This may provoke certain responses by a Sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as:    1. Confusion;  2. Fear;   3. Trepidation; and  4. Curiosity    I believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage.  All of these potential responses will cause a Bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not.     The fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. Chances are better than not that when a Squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. It may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare.    As a practical matter I think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. See how the Squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. I am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so I will be very interested to see the results.     There are all sorts of variations on this concept. The goal here is to throw a Bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. The idea is to create a weird scene in an area where Bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. At the same time, you want it to perplex the BF to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. While this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the Sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head.     Here are some other ideas I have to cause a Bigfoot to pause due to confusion:     1. Outdoors sex/orgy: Get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a Bigfoot hotspot. This will really pique a scratch's interest. At some point a Squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out!     2. Poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. It probably will take longer to attract a Squatch.     3. Strange looking people: these are people that Squatch are not used to seeing. For example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins.     4. Fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. The noise and weird scene will generate some Bigfoot interest.     Some believe that Sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. I think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. Confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. Therefore, we take the Squatch's advantage away from it. This will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.",

It's one thing if it's realism, but with anime styles you don't have to have realistic proportions ( nobody has huge anime eyes IRL lol). The colors look different on different types of screens and I know this because some of my old work looks very vibrant on my new laptop and kinda washed out on a phone screen. It would be cool if people stopped bitching and let artists enjoy creating art. Most fanart I do is usually unpaid work in my free time. With commissions I tell people to show me the exact color for skin, eyes and hair. I never had any complaints about how I draw poc. However, I don't like how artists are being treated. If you don't draw poc you are racist, if you do you are still racist because they are not dark enough. It's funny how it's perfectly ok to draw white chatacters as black, but if you make a black character a shade too light in a pastel style all hell breaks loose.",

Instead of encouraging such behaviors, people should encourage them to get  the necessary medical help.    On top of that body positivity should be embracing your natural body type. Whether it be a pear, banana, apple, hourglass or etc. Fashion designers make different styles that cater to different body types. Its ridiculous when people get upset when an outfit doesn't look good on them, when its not for their body type to begin with. Embracing their body type is the best way to figure out what makes them look beautiful. Like wearing a size 4 when they're really a size 14. Not only do they make themselves look bad but it gives them a harder/very uncomfortable time forcing themselves in spanx and corsets. Do yourself a favor and wear clothes that work for you, don't wear it just bc its what so and so wore or its what society wants. Everyone is beautiful or handsome in their own unique ways.

So that's nothing to do with the quality of your content, and definitely nothing personal. I asked a question once that got a bunch of responses. I replied to as many as I could, being as gracious as possible, but finally just had to give up on it. I'd thought about posting a \"thank you for such a thoughtful reply!\" or something to each of the rest of them, but that almost seemed like it would be worse. Like some kind of soulless form letter bot response. Sometimes it's difficult to know what the best thing would be to do in that sort of situation, since different people will react differently to things, and you're guaranteed not to be able to please everyone no matter what you do.

Theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. This is the same basic recruiting tactic that ISIS uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic.

I've been eating whatever I want because if I try and restrict what I eat, it just sends me down a really unhealthy guilty path that I'm not in the place to go down anymore.     The problem is I've gotten fat. My BMI is technically healthy (23) but we all know it doesn't mean anything. I'm in the middle of some serious exams and I can't excersize right now because I need to study all the time. All I can feel is my legs touching and my stomach rolling on itself and my flabby arms and the extra skin on my back and the flab on my waist and my fat neck. I don't know how much of this is dysmorphia and how much is me being fat, but I'm fine most of the time until it hits me in waves like it is now.     I tried to take some nudes and my body just seemed wrong. I tried to put on a pair of shorts but they've gotten so tight they barely fit. I bought all my clothes when I was BMI 16.5-19 and they're so tight and ill-fitting now, and I can't afford more.    I really just wish I could take a scissors and chop off all the fat. It's so unfair, because whenever I see someone who has told me they recovered from an eating disorder, they look normal. They haven't gained loads of weight like me. I just want to go on a diet, but I promised myself I'd eat whatever I want until the end of this year, to let myself get used to this new body. If I start dieting I'm scared I'll just hate myself more. I'm so annoyed I just wish I didn't feel like this.",

I don't think you are a loser :)    I think by making this post it shows you do want to change, and by having regret over not doing things at the end of the year it shows you want to change as well. That is important, if you don't really have the drive to grow, then you aren't going to.     I don't know where you live, but perhaps there is a community center, or a park? A place for you to walk? Going to a center or a park where there are people could help you make friends, and get exercise as well. If you don't know how to break the ice with someone, giving them a compliment might work, or asking them a question about something they have with them (like, \"oh that's a cool phone, what kind is it?\"). Take the conversation from there (if they seem comfortable with the confrontation). You can't make friends if you don't put yourself out there at least a little.     I also don't know your interests, but go to places where you can find people with similar ones. If you go to a store that has things that interest you, even talking to the employees could help. They probably have an interest in the thing too, and they have to be welcoming to customers, so it is good practice to try talking to them if you are still uncomfortable with the idea of making friends. Also, chatting with people online leads to more practice as well as online friends that can be there for you!    For losing weight, start simple. Don't tell yourself you are going to start going to the gym everyday if you don't think you will, and don't feel bad for knowing how much you can or can't handle. Again, I don't know how chubby you are, but you know yourself. Take a walk everyday, introduce one healthy food into your life (or take away one unhealthy food) every week if diet is a problem for you. And let yourself have a cheat day, it can help you in the long run. If you are scared to work out in public, buy some weights of your own and watch some Netflix while lifting them. Make it somewhat enjoyable so you stick with it, so ooh don't get discouraged for not wanting to follow through. I believe in you!     Good luck to you, friend :D",

Luo Guanzhong might have been putting the names Liu Bei,Cao Cao and Sun Quan on paper, but it was really expos\u00e9 on current or recently historical political events.     The southern Ming saw themselves as fighting an illegitimate foreign Dynasty to reestablish a dynasty ruled by the ethnically Han people's, in the same vein as Liu Bei trying to reestablish the venerable Han Empire in Shu-Han from Wei usurpers.    So Liu Bei became an allegory for the southern Ming patriots and Cao Cao for the evil northern led Yuan \"usurpers\".

Both authors have very little credibility to be frank.    That having been said ... articles like this never acknowledge the good, they always zero in on what the author perceives as bad. They never seem to consider the father who (they claim) failed to do the things they are whining about had his own issues to deal with.     Case in point:    >Sexton, 37, grew up in Linton, a dirt-poor, factory-family town in southern Indiana, just southeast of Terre Haute.    Given that fact, and the fact there is a photo of Sexton and his (now crucified in public after his death) father at the Daytona 500 in 2007, and given that Nascar enjoys most of it's popularity amongst blue collar workers we can reasonably infer that Sexton's father was working in a factory in a struggling town.    Most likely working long hours, in a difficult job.    Yet these regressives never acknowledge that in their haste to virtue signal. They never acknowledge the burdens their fathers endured *for their children's sake* in their pursuit of a narrative which bears little relation to reality.",

            "input": "A little story time. Who's up for some context?!    This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way.    One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her \"Jill.\" We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman.    Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started.    Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke.    The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other.    She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. \"I missed talking to you,\" \"It feels like it's been so long since we talked,\" et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. \"I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck.\" Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just \"No you're not\" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that.    I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* \"You know I have a life outside of you, right?\", but then again... maybe I should've?    Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation (\"I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that\") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago.    Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net), blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on.    Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while.    Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social.    Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her \"Claire\") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net). Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say \"hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon.\"    She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, \"Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year.\"    So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating.    TL;DR: Extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that I needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.",

Nobody has a problem with girl power. What people don't like is having girl power - or any agenda - shoved down their throats when they go to watch a movie about aliens and exploding spaceships. When some people dared to say so, they were - predictablty - attacked as misogynists and racists and incels and Nazis and whatever etc etc. So that blew the whole thing up before the movie was even released.

It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules.    My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job.    He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. He also said that I was his best friend, which is when I fell hard, because I've never had a best friend. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere.    He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better.    I asked for a better explanation, but he said, \" listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!\" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, \"alrighty.\". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood.    That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me?    or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all.    I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. He kept telling me I looked \"devastated\" the last time I saw him. I was not mentally well, because I felt like I was morally wrong. I used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person.    TL;DR guy that I fell in love with says he loves me, then dumps me after taking my virginity. Haven't heard from him since.",

The soviet population wasn't very fond of Stalin, and had the Germans not been as harsh as they were, they likely could have turned the soviet population on Stalin.    Stalin actually thought the war was over.    > At 3.30 a.m. on 22 June 1941 the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, Georgi Zhukov, telephoned Stalin's dacha to rouse the Soviet leader from his sleep. The Germans, he told him, had begun shelling Red Army positions along the frontier. Stalin refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was under way. Surely, he told a small gathering of civilian and military leaders in Moscow later in the morning, Hitler did not know about it. There must be a conspiracy among the leaders of the German armed forces. It was only when the German Ambassador, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, met Foreign Minister Molotov in the Kremlin to hand over the German declaration of war that Stalin recognized he had been duped by Hitler. Initially shocked, embarrassed and disoriented, Stalin soon pulled himself together. On 23 June 1941 he worked at his desk in the Kremlin from 3.20 in the morning to 6.25 in the evening, gathering information and making the necessary arrangements for the creation of a Supreme Command to take charge of operations. As the days went by, he became increasingly dispirited by the scale and speed of the German advance. At the end of June, he left for his dacha, saying, in his inimitably coarse way, 'Everything's lost. I give up. Lenin founded our state and we've fucked it up.' He made no address to the Soviet people, he did not talk to his subordinates, he did not even answer the phone. German planes, indeed, dropped leaflets over the Red Army lines claiming that he was dead. When a delegation from the Politburo arrived at the dacha, they found Stalin slumped in an armchair. 'Why have you come?' he asked. With a thrill of terror, two members of the delegation, Mikoyan and Beria, realized he thought they had come to arrest him.    And gave the famous speech, rallying the soviet population behind him.    > Within a few days of retreating to his dacha in despair, Stalin recovered his nerve, if indeed he had really lost it. Some thought he had retreated into temporary isolation like Ivan the Terrible centuries before, to demonstrate his indispensability. A State Defence Committee was set up, with Stalin himself in the chair. His retreat had given him the chance to rethink his role. On 3 July 1941, the same day that Franz Halder confided to his diary his belief that victory had already been achieved by the German forces, Stalin spoke to the Soviet people over the radio, for the first time not as Communist dictator but as patriotic leader. 'Brothers and sisters,' he said, 'friends!' This was an entirely new note. He went so far as to admit that the Red Army had been unprepared for the attack. The Germans, he said, were 'wicked and perfidious . . . heavily armed with tanks and artillery'. But they would not prevail. The Soviet people had to organize civil defence and mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat the enemy. It was necessary to form partisan groups behind the lines to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. Silence, lies and evasion, people felt, had at last been replaced with some kind of truth. Communist Party propaganda began to emphasize the defence not of the revolution but of the motherland. The party newspaper, Pravda ('Truth'), dropped the slogan 'Workers of the World, Unite!' from its masthead and replaced it with 'Death to the German Invaders!' Nikolai Moskvin noted on 30 September 1941 that 'the mood of the local population has changed sharply'. From constantly threatening to betray him to the Germans, they came round to the patriotic cause after learning that the occupation authorities were keeping the collective farms going because it made it easier to collect the grain for transporting back to Germany.    > The speech's patriotic appeal was all the more powerful because people were already beginning to learn the bitter realities of German occupation. Stories of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps mingled with eyewitness reports of the mass shooting of civilians and the burning of villages by German troops to produce in the still-retreating ranks of the Red Army a determination to fight the enemy that had been almost entirely absent in the first chaotic days of the war. When the city of Kursk fell, the Germans arrested all the healthy male inhabitants, penned them into open barbed-wire enclosures without food or water, and then put them to work, guarded by Germans wielding rubber truncheons. 'The streets are empty,' noted a Soviet intelligence report. 'The shops have been looted. There is no mains water and no electricity. Kursk has collapsed.'",

The same way even the political and other more divisive subreddits were about the subject itself.    Even if /r/Socialism was run by a socialist and /r/Capitalism by a capitalist the purpose was not to create a community of socialists or capitalists but discuss the subjects, events and happenings concerning them.    Today almost no sub is about about discussing it **but being part of it, being supportive of it, being loyal to it.**  (Exceptions for like \"True, or Truetrue subs).    This is why TD bans even supporters of **Donald Trump** when critically analyzing the presidents actions in say his ever more hawkish appointments.     Or why various socialist subs ban outright **socialist members** for lifting the issue in Venezuela from a critical point of view.    Or even why the mods in /r/Food will ban you for criticizing someones food, or notion of food or beauty or taste of food.     The concept of what a sub is about has changed. Or rather what a sub is *for*. Subreddits are no longer divisions of topics but divided communities.     I remember on one of my older accounts one of my first banishments was in a subreddit for something literally called \"/r/soylent\" (from the movie Soylent Green) and rebranded as something positive. I was absolutely downvoted and then banished after a prolonged discussion (with little give and take) and I've seen this mannerism now spread to all sectors of Reddit.     We either need to change this very fundamental of perception in ourselves or we must accept that even completely benign and neutral subreddits like say /r/News or your local subreddit will be taken over by a particular group and that group will congregate around their definition of the subject and then proceed to isolate voices that do not adhere to that as it progresses to define itself, whether openly or subconsciously.       We must rethink what we use reddit for or concede that this is the future.          ____      A way to stop this would be to change a fundamental concept of Reddit. To forbid subreddits from having selective enforcing based on any stance on any one issue.     So you could talk as much shit about socialism as you wanted in a socialist sub as you could talk shit about capitalism in a capitalist sub as long as you followed the rest of the subs rules.     I honestly think that it's either this or we might as well shut up about it, because organic change might not come about as all the subs are now protecting themselves against brigading and \"concern trolling\" and other such things the same way an arms race in real life functions. So either make them all bend the knee or the struggle is pointless. But at least we can come to a common understanding of why it is happening, hence this thread. This way we can also stop acting out as victims of a particular ideology, religion, sex, location, interest or what ever when we get banned.

But literacy tests applied without racial discrimination have always [been upheld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassiter_v._Northampton_County_Board_of_Elections).    It was a law, specifically the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that banned literacy tests, not some Supreme Court ruling. And really, that national ban is probably on shakier constitutional grounds than any neutrally applied literacy test.     So yeah, I still don't think it's a good idea because people would immediately abuse their power to write the test questions, but it would only take a change in legislation to bring the tests back.",

She mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash.    Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin.    Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.     If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level.    **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from \"unconditional love\" to \"social contract\" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. If you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.",

I learned to cut down tall trees and turn them into small logs for her.  I learned to repair cars for her.  I took her wherever she wanted go.  Plays, vacations, concerts, art shows, festivals.  Some days I would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky I was.    Then my wife suffered an aneurysm.  I spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids.  Whatever she wanted I brought to her.  Whatever the kids needed, they got.  The balls stayed in the air.    In the months following her release,  I took care of her like a nanny.  Whatever she wanted she got.  She wanted a new car.  We got her the top of the line package.  She wanted a new TV.  She wanted a new laptop.  She wanted new clothes and a new kitchen.  Done and done and done and done and done.    She entered peri-menopause.  Everything that she could not control became Enemy.  She became paranoid.  She obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when I got home.  She obsessed over my daily mileage.  An extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that I was fucking the neighbor.  She claimed that I tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak.  We did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation.     The kids began to suffer.  She became increasingly volatile and violent.  Many times I came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall.  If I was home I had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat.  He rmother pleaded with her to get professional help.  Our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help.  I agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a PhD level neuropsychologist.      Eventually the kids moved out of the house.  She demanded that I remove them from my will.  She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way.  I was to stop their annual gifts.  i was to stop paying for their health insurance.  She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits.  She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies.  My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money.    Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her.  I moved out and filed for divorce.    I have offered to give her everything.  The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced.  The cars that are paid off.  Every single piece of movable property.  All I want in return is my retirement.  I just want to be shut of her.  She refuses to respond to my offer.    She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support.  She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied.  Denied but costly to the defendant.  If one stuck I would probably lose my job.    She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too.    Her death would make everyone sad but our lives would improve immensely.",

We rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me.      I can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but I honestly don't see her doing so. She smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. She has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. Because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and I feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. She is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. She is insistent on having children in the future, but I can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. She does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but I don't believe her because I have seen how low her depression can pull her down.      As for some background on myself, I'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, I occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. I also have a lot of creative art hobbies that I do from time to time. My view on recreational drugs is quite lax, I am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. What I am willing to say is that I also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but I'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity.       Since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. There is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. This will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which I'm not the greatest fan of.       I have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when I try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress.      I honestly love my girlfriend, and I can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. I would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself,  I feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger.      I really don't know how to approach the matter, and I have been thinking about this for the longest time. I can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. I can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but I would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out.      I just wanted this off my chest, I didn't come here for advice, but suggestions or comments about my/her lifestyle will be read. Thanks for reading.",

Born in Atlanta, King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, tactics his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi helped inspire.    King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and in 1957 became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).    ***    **Civil rights movement**    The civil rights movement (also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms) in the United States was a decades-long struggle with the goal of enforcing constitutional and legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already enjoyed. With roots that dated back to the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s, after years of direct actions and grassroots protests that were organized from the mid-1950s until 1968. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation, disenfranchisement, and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection for all Americans.    After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution granted emancipation and constitutional rights of citizenship to all African Americans, most of whom had recently been enslaved.    ***    ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]  ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

We were only there together for an hour before everyone disappeared saying they all had things to do.

All of the people who we \"busy\" were all hanging out in the city.    All our \"friends\" left my best mates 17th to go hang out by themselves. After seeing this we both realised that they had been hiding their plans from us all week. Hiding their phones when in group chats just not talking to us about the party. They basically turned up for free paintball (which is expensive!!) And left for themselves.

Quote me one person in this thread or in the entirety of this comment section who said something along those lines. I seriously want to know.    I don't know anyone who says that. It's basically impossible to find most jokes funny. Not everyone can appreciate light humour like Piano Cat while still enjoying Holocaust jokes. But hey, if you can, then you're probably insane.    That being said, if you really hate certain jokes that much, ignore them. Anyone who tells speeches or does stand-up knows that the worst feeling you could have after saying something is not a unanimous reaction or a food execution, but just complete silence as everyone transitions to whatever else they were doing.     >I feel like the people who get bent out of shape when someone doesn't agree with them are the ones who are way too sensitive...    Yes. Again, yes. No one disagrees with you there, especially the aforementioned maniac.

Your dad is a sorry excuse for a man saying that to his suicidal child. Disgusting. I can set a standard that makes him an irrelevant worm in comparison too. But that isn't fair, is it?        If I were you: \"Oh alright. Well then, with that, our \"relationship\" has actually just ended. I will no longer speak to you again nor ask you for help. Since you seem nonchalant about my existence in this world, goodbye. Don't speak unless it is in an apologetic manner for the absolute filth you just hurled at me. As for the financial matter, thank you for stating the terms of business. I'll work out a way to sustain myself, since you both have made yourselves abundantly clear. I do not and will not expect monetary aid from you. Thank you.\"        I'm in a similar place as you. Both of my parents are acting insane, though one of them actually is a sociopath. And yes I've had suicidal thoughts on and off almost my whole life. My sociopath parent has plenty of money, houses, etc. We've never had a relationship except when I was a baby(doesn't count). I've literally told this parent to not put me in their will. It was to send a message. What's that message?        Money isn't love, and I don't need that from you. I never needed it. I needed a parent, but now it's too late and I'm indifferent(or more accurately don't WANT a relationship). Just like you've been my entire life. If you don't have an innate desire out of your own heart to help your own child, then I absolutely do NOT want anything at all from you. I don't accept blood money. Period.        Leave your parents house ASAP. I'm telling you. I waited too long, don't be like me. Do it NOW. You won't heal/grow properly unless you do. They're probably the ones making you suicidal. Leave and rely on yourself if you have to. That's what I'm doing right now and it feels awesome. If you have to wait and save up money for college I say it's worth it. The satisfaction of not taking a dime from your parent that doesn't care if you exist is priceless. Be independent ASAP. You have innate worth and dignity just by virtue of being a human being. You need to respect yourself too, and know that you have worth. Just because they are your parents, that does not give them impunity to hurl crap at you without consequences. Stand up for yourself, respectfully. Be confident you're in the right and don't let anger consume you. You have value, and are valued, and nobody can take that away. Work however much it takes to get out. Once you're independent and floating your own boat, reexamine your suicidal thoughts if they're there still. I know it sounds kinda dumb but literally tell your suicide to take a back seat and do this task first. I can guarantee you will AT LEAST feel better, and maybe not suicidal anymore. Process of elimination, eliminate the two glaring suspects. Don't keep debating within yourself like \"Oh maybe I can stay longer and they will treat me better\" etc. In your heart of hearts you know whether or not your living environment is toxic to your mental health.

It's really that easy to control what you see on the forum.  It's taking responsibility of what you want to see.  The reality is that, if someone isn't getting any responses, they'll eventually leave and you don't even have to know they were there in the first place.

My happiness was mine.   Anyway, I'm sorry you're feeling this pain.  I hope your chapters are full of more love and happiness.

This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex.    It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice.    For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying \"you've never successfully performed this challenge\", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail.

            "input": "We first got the internet in our house in 1998; I was 12. The first website I visited was TheForce.Net; the second was a porn site. I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect \u2014 and safe \u2014 release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15.    Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test \u2014 I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.     I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.     I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things \u2014 namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem.    Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn \u2014 streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.     A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing. The next time I see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes.     I'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like I'm done hiding from the world. I don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. My mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. Telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. Thanks for reading.    tl;dr: Masturbated daily for twenty two years, used it as a crutch to avoid my anxiety, ran my social life into the ground, but fuck both of those things now. I'm in therapy and I'm gonna go out there and get mine.",

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

The theory is that since \"everyone is sad and lonely\", they've been brainwashed into loving Pikachu because Pikachu is portrayed as being an eternal friend.    Further, they're arguing that this is similar to the way conspiracy-style communities recruit people. As that [flat-earther documentary on Netflix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8132700/) showed, a major recruiting point for 'crazy' groups is the companionship of a community. Lonely people often gravitate towards these kinds of groups because they're more willing to accept outsiders, and are more tolerant of deviant behaviour.    That in itself is accurate, but using it to describe why people like Pikachu is pretty crazy. People like Pikachu because it's a cute critter, which is brave, fun to watch, and (usually) reminds us of our childhoods.",

I eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (Artella.com). This was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. At this point I was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.     Getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, I really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most VFX houses). Someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/VFX.    You tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. I was fully aware of that when I was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. But I wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. Sure there are people that grow out it, but I've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.

If you like comics The Watchmen has great symbolism and framing. As does V for Vendetta. The Sandman comics are good, too. I also recommend Ichi the Killer if you are feeling adventurous. It is definitely NSFW/L depending on your views. Ichi is one piece of work I try to get other people to read because I still have some serious unanswered questions about things.

They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass.

They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.    #**\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)**    Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning.    #**\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)**    The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right?    #**\u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4\u05d9 (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)**    Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late.    #**\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05e0\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2 (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)**    I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right?    #**\u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)**    This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge.     #**\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)**    This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.    ________    #**\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 \u05e0\u05e6\u05d7\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc (LET IT BE SAID LET IT BE DONE FOREVER AND FOREVER FOR ALL THAT IS AND WILL BE PRAISE DEMIURGE PRAISE THE ARCHONS)**",

Writing it in a journal doesn't work because there's this desperate feeling for someone to know that you're suffering, while also such an intense shame and guilt about it that you can't tell your family or friends. So /r/offmychest gets a post.     At least in my experience, advice or sympathy don't really help and just make me feel worse. I feel the need to argue against it and say \"well I've tried that and it didn't work\" or shit like that, but feel like such a dick arguing against wellmeaning people that I just don't respond and end up deleting the post a few hours later anyway.     So just don't take it personally. A lot of times folks (or at least me) don't have an outlet and will spew their guts out to the internet because it's better than keeping it in. We aren't looking for advice or sympathy, there's just a depression/anxiety demon whispering in your ear and it often gets so loud that you just need to uncork your feelings to relieve a little pressure.

The game and the content is the same. All of the benefits are for the developer. I mean if we look at the situation with taxis and ride shares, it's clear where the consumer is getting a better deal. So realistically, it's just an unpleasant situation but no unexpected. It's a business first and they go where the money is.     That being said competition is healthy when it drives businesses towards improvements. But that's not what Epic is doing right now. They aren't even addressing the consumer, which is evident by their store being so unfinished. They are addressing the developers. Once they have amassed enough clout in the business, they might start offering benefits to customers but right now, it's not about the public. It's about the gaming development industry.    I'll freely admit I never buy a game at launch. It has nothing to do with it being buggy or something like that. I just don't have the money. I have to wait until everything is released and on sale (even if it's an OK sale and not a great 75% sale). I've waited for Borderlands 3 for this long. I can wait some more.",

We (I am one as well) are a real thing, it's determined by your nervous system, which in HSPs is more developed than average. Almost 20% of people are HSP's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. It serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. Highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. It used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. Anyway, I consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility.  I'm not implying that you are HSP, but doing some research on that topic might be really helpful, because HSPs and Ausies share a lot in characteristics. I hope I helped at least a little",

I think that's fair, but that seems like more of a pragmatic argument to put prohibitions on it than a moral argument against its practice.

Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or \"congenital eunuchs\". In 19th and 20th century medical literature, intersex was referred as true hermaphroditism, female pseudohermaphroditism, and male pseudohermaphroditism reflecting the first taxonomic efforts to classify intersex conditions. These terms are no longer used: terms including the word \"hermaphrodite\" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious.    ***    ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]  ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Those types of posts hit critical mass a long time ago. This post was just terrible. If it ties into a post on another subreddit, then it should have been posted there.    People used to point out the sub is for interesting pictures as a complaint and the mods removed \"interesting\" from the sidebar. When progress pics were overwhelming the sub people started posting selfies with their gym pass when they bought one. Then there was a post that hit the top that was just a selfie of an overweight dude that said he was planning to buy a gym membership.     Devoid of any context this photos aren't interesting in the least. Voters seem to prefer these uninteresting backstory posts while people who actively comment do not. Since the mods have made it clear they care more about the voting group than the commenting group, frustration is going to build.

Over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to ESA laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places.  *Especially* for large animals.  I lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit.  We were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted.  And by the time I left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting \"pet rent,\" an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees.      ESA certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties.  Especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most.    On the other side, not everyone can handle ESA's.  I love dogs, I've had some amazing dogs.  But I was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust.  I still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it.  My husband is allergic.  I am too, mildly though.  If the dog has been bathed in a week, I'm usually fine.    We were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an [afghan dog](https://images.app.goo.gl/3FCkPSTc1Wooe39D6).  They allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer.  My husband started to have an allergic reaction.  The couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside.  As he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and I were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left.    Husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction.  My husband, the man I call Snow White incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him.  So, we left.  The emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband.    I've utilized the ESA privileges (for housing), as I do have qualifying conditions.  I've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however.  I still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge.  I still see it every time I see a cocker spaniel.  I see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking.  I also remember how lucky I felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so I could get my girl, and the amazing life I had with her.      It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules.  We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it.  The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.  (Seriously, one couple force bred their Pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night.  We had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). If you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house.  Why are they worth less than people who need ESA's?    Edit: fix words",

It wasn't a happy parade with rainbows and dance music. It was a bunch or angry gays finally saying \"we've had enough\" and standing up to police brutality and raids on gay spaces.     Since then, the movement has endured the AIDS Crisis, and we only had each other when the government did nothing.     We created new spaces to welcome in the people who never fit into society.     And for the decades, LGBTQ+ youth have been the targets of hate crimes. They face hate speech and the fear of death in some places. Gay-youth have some of the highest rates of suicide in North America.     We have had to rally and throw our sexuality \"in your face\" just to fucking marry the person we love.     Gay people have been denied jobs, or fired because of their sexuality.     For many people, pride isn't \"just\" about celebrating being gay, its about celebrating that DESPITE being gay, we have survived the harassment, the violence, the depression and anxiety. Its about remembering those who did the hardest of the work to get us to where we are today. So yes, we absolutely should be proud of being gay and all the baggage that has come with it. Straight people aren't attacked for being straight. You have never been denied a job for being straight. You have had the privilege of being in the majority. To marry who you love.     Now, that being said there is a lot about pride that even I have issues with. But Pride reminds us of where we were and how far we've come.      And please, for the love of God, don't come at me with \"But no one cares about you being gay in 2019\" because that's bullshit. The Orlando shooting happened 3 years ago.

And the only difference with a transgender person is they're constantly pumping their body with hormone replacement and have gone through surgery to look like the other gender. Biologically, they're still the gender they were born as.

Yet it's \"transphobic\" to point out the natural observation that their mindset isn't a healthy one.      Being an angry little man is not the same thing as doing ideological criticism, lol.

That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that \"nobody supports them except those in the group\" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.     I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses \u2014 find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that \u2014 it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.    ^just to be clear, this is in a generic \"you\", I'm not accusing you of any of this    > hit in the head with a baton or bat    I hope it's clear that I don't condone this whatsoever. And this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation.    > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does.    But in order for this to be at all relevant \u2014 you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that I linked. Again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? Or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories I linked?    I'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions.    > The difference between supporting assholes.    Do you think all assholes are created equal or something? Would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child?        People don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. You can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. Just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral.      The hoax stuff is interesting and probably worth exploring but not sure how it relates to this stuff.",

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

In an urban environment, cover and concealment are everywhere, so the first shot may likely be the only clean shot you get. The ballistics of the 10mm Auto out of a 6.02\" barrel are almost unrivaled in semi-automatic pistols, and at 100 yards it's still going plenty fast to properly open the hollow-points I use, and it has a flat trajectory so I barely have to compensate for drop.

It made me question my own art. I know I'm not that good but I know I'm not that bad either.     Overall, I have faith in mother nature and there must be a good reason behind why this happened.

Pretty sure *knowing how to read* was illegal for black people for awhile, and voting? Haha... no. I think I was still 3/5ths of a person back then.    These people piss me off because they're denigrating the actual racism my grandparents actually lived through. The Klan walked the streets while sweeping Democratic gun laws stopped my grandparents from owning firearms to protect themselves and their children (my father) and they got poll taxes and literacy tests at the polls removed *in their lifetime*- to say nothing of desegregation.    Like what the fuck? Where do these people live that they think anywhere South of the Mason-Dixon is somehow some backwater redneck hick town? Atlanta is in the South- the headquarters of their beloved CNN. So is Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Miami, Knoxville, Charleston, Savannah and a dozen other major metro areas.    The worst part of it all is that these people remind me more of slaveowners than 'progressives'- every slave master thought they were doing black people a favor: we were godless heathens so they put us to work, gave us a place to sleep and food to eat, and \"civilized the negro\". Hey guys, guess what? If I was being subjected to anything resembling systemic civil war-era racism in the South, I'd pick my black ass up and get the fuck out.

In addition to this, private messages from a chat group got leaked that involved multiple high profile people in the music industry chatting and talking about actually going out and raping girls (directly using the korean word for rape) and one was sharing secret videos of his sexcapades (which is a WHOLE other issue in Korea since they ban real porn sites so people share illegally filmed spy camera porn and such) including prefacing some of them saying that he was only filming because she was passed out because he knew she would say no.

Maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. Maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting.     In a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting depression. Maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. Maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time.     In a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. Maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. Sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying \"thanks for the advice!\" feels fake. Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like \"Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all\". Or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea.     All of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying \"Thanks!\". Maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. Maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. Maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority.     In short, it's probably not personal. Just relax.

But it's hard to take any of these criticisms of Epic beyond anything other than \"Fortnite bad.\"",

I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home.    One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that.    He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him \"go home. You have a kid.\" He told me \"I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you.\" He said he didn't do all this for anyone.    Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens.     But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen.    Before I left, he told me \"the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music.\" Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself.     It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise.    I love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and I will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. It's more than that. He saved me.    Thank you. If you're out there somewhere.",

We've turned sex into a commodity, with the 'haves' and 'have nots'. It breeds jealousy and hatred, hence the incel community.    The attitude about not having it is hypocritical too. People will go out and say: \"There's nothing wrong with being a virgin!\" and then turn around and go \"Wow this guy isn't getting laid lol.\"     Shit like this is why people feel pressured to go out and fuck just because they feel like they have to in order to be 'living'.    You would think, that as a whole, with as advanced as a society we've become, we would put our more primal desires behind us and put our efforts into other things, but no. We focus on sex sex sex.     In school, sport, Reddit, TV, movies, sex is almost always a topic, maybe thinly veiled as 'romance', maybe not.

I'm not happy, I can't remember the last time I was, and I'm not sure I even know what I need to be happy with my life. I don't know what to do. I've been on antidepressants, and I still feel this way. Sometimes I have good days or good weeks, but I usually end up completely melting down and losing it again over something. I don't know how to make it better or if I even can.    I can't afford to move out. I can't afford to rent where I live, I certainly can't afford to buy a house or a flat, and I don't see a way out. Every time I'm reminded of the lifestyle my parents had at the same age as me, it upsets me because I know I'll never have that, it's going to pass me by. I don't even know why I want to emulate them in that way because they're divorced now. I'm scared that down the line I'm going to feel like I've missed a whole chapter of my own life.    My girlfriend broke up with me a year ago. She did the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me, I don't forgive her and I never will. I find it hard to meet people and I thought she was going to be it for me. I still miss her and I think I'm probably going to carry this for the rest of my life. She didn't just take away the relationship, she took away all the hopes and dreams I had for being a proper functioning adult and being happy. What's really bothering me about it right now is that I ruined things - before they even started - with another girl who liked me and who I liked too, to be with her. This absolutely is my fault and even if it probably wouldn't have worked out with her I spend far too much time thinking about if I blew my chance at being happy with someone.    I hate my job. If you told me tomorrow that it was gone and I could never go back, I wouldn't care. Wouldn't give one single solitary fuck. I hate the building, I hate the place it's in, I hate the noise, I hate the customers, I hate all of it. I could just find a new job and leave, but I feel so completely ground down and I don't think I would find anything better so I can't motivate myself to. I could go back to university and learn to do something else but not without getting myself into a lot of debt I'll never be able to pay off.    I've never wanted to have a real job, because I can't handle the real world. As a kid I dreamed of being an athlete, although it became clear pretty early on that I was never going to be. I love sports but I'm just not good enough to even play at a recreational level, and that kills me and I don't enjoy them as much as I would like because of that. Then I started to pursue music, and I was OK at that, but I just can't do it. I can't meet other people who share the same musical aspirations as me, I can't write a song because nothing comes out when I try to, I just can't get it right.    I can't stop obsessing over things that I can't change. I can't stop obsessing over perfection and trying to obtain it. I can't stop obsessing over how all kinds of small details in my life are wrong. I can't feel part of anything. I can't even build a set of fucking shelves. I can't have all the time back that I've wasted. I can't cope.    And I feel like an entitled little prick for being bothered by these things as much as I am.",
