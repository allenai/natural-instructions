An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) or Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) or Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) or Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.), indicate via \"yes\". Otherwise, response via \"no\".",

Since then, the movement has endured the AIDS Crisis, and we only had each other when the government did nothing.     We created new spaces to welcome in the people who never fit into society.     And for the decades, LGBTQ+ youth have been the targets of hate crimes. They face hate speech and the fear of death in some places. Gay-youth have some of the highest rates of suicide in North America.     We have had to rally and throw our sexuality \"in your face\" just to fucking marry the person we love.     Gay people have been denied jobs, or fired because of their sexuality.     For many people, pride isn't \"just\" about celebrating being gay, its about celebrating that DESPITE being gay, we have survived the harassment, the violence, the depression and anxiety. Its about remembering those who did the hardest of the work to get us to where we are today. So yes, we absolutely should be proud of being gay and all the baggage that has come with it. Straight people aren't attacked for being straight. You have never been denied a job for being straight. You have had the privilege of being in the majority. To marry who you love.     Now, that being said there is a lot about pride that even I have issues with. But Pride reminds us of where we were and how far we've come.      And please, for the love of God, don't come at me with \"But no one cares about you being gay in 2019\" because that's bullshit. The Orlando shooting happened 3 years ago. A gay man in my town was stabbed - for being gay - just last summer. There are still countries where homosexuality is illegal.     ....and thats the end of my rant.",

If I were you: \"Oh alright. Well then, with that, our \"relationship\" has actually just ended. I will no longer speak to you again nor ask you for help. Since you seem nonchalant about my existence in this world, goodbye. Don't speak unless it is in an apologetic manner for the absolute filth you just hurled at me. As for the financial matter, thank you for stating the terms of business. I'll work out a way to sustain myself, since you both have made yourselves abundantly clear. I do not and will not expect monetary aid from you. Thank you.\"        I'm in a similar place as you. Both of my parents are acting insane, though one of them actually is a sociopath. And yes I've had suicidal thoughts on and off almost my whole life. My sociopath parent has plenty of money, houses, etc. We've never had a relationship except when I was a baby(doesn't count). I've literally told this parent to not put me in their will. It was to send a message. What's that message?        Money isn't love, and I don't need that from you. I never needed it. I needed a parent, but now it's too late and I'm indifferent(or more accurately don't WANT a relationship). Just like you've been my entire life. If you don't have an innate desire out of your own heart to help your own child, then I absolutely do NOT want anything at all from you. I don't accept blood money. Period.        Leave your parents house ASAP. I'm telling you. I waited too long, don't be like me. Do it NOW. You won't heal/grow properly unless you do. They're probably the ones making you suicidal. Leave and rely on yourself if you have to. That's what I'm doing right now and it feels awesome. If you have to wait and save up money for college I say it's worth it. The satisfaction of not taking a dime from your parent that doesn't care if you exist is priceless. Be independent ASAP. You have innate worth and dignity just by virtue of being a human being. You need to respect yourself too, and know that you have worth. Just because they are your parents, that does not give them impunity to hurl crap at you without consequences. Stand up for yourself, respectfully. Be confident you're in the right and don't let anger consume you. You have value, and are valued, and nobody can take that away. Work however much it takes to get out. Once you're independent and floating your own boat, reexamine your suicidal thoughts if they're there still. I know it sounds kinda dumb but literally tell your suicide to take a back seat and do this task first. I can guarantee you will AT LEAST feel better, and maybe not suicidal anymore. Process of elimination, eliminate the two glaring suspects. Don't keep debating within yourself like \"Oh maybe I can stay longer and they will treat me better\" etc. In your heart of hearts you know whether or not your living environment is toxic to your mental health.

But, I came back to find a mod queue with almost 100 reports needing attention.  I went through about forty of them and noted they were all leg humping related and user-on-user drama...so, I quickly typed up that post telling people how they could be their own superhero and mute people that pissed them off.     In my opinion and experience, we were pretty hands off and used to only get involved if the report was blatantly in violation of the rules.  Because, frankly, the rules were pretty subjective.  Personally, I only ever removed six comments in my tenure as mod.  Most of the time, I just wrote a quick note to the person who was reported and the reporter to say \"hey, guys...as a reminder, please...fill in the blank\".  That worked for months!  Then,  there was this sort of gang mentality that arose and the reports got petty and no one wanted to discuss anything. They just wanted to name and shame and started attacking each other. It was stupid. But, as I said, good luck to anyone modding that forum and I wish them well because it's quite a task.",

When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons.    This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation.    With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding.    In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.",

So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted.    And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women.    And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy.    Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most.    In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around.    So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.     Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people.    Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it.      And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine. Everyone is an individual.",

People used to point out the sub is for interesting pictures as a complaint and the mods removed \"interesting\" from the sidebar.

In red ans blue, we're told the reason we keep beating Blue is because we treat our pokemon as our friends, while hes only concerned with having the strongest team. He looses because his pokemon dont actually care aboit him because he doesnt show them kindness, while our pokemon go above and beyond because they genuinely dont want to let us down - this is a theme continued in nearly every game in the franchise.      Now, heres the sad part. They say this is \"the same way the alt right recruits incels\" which is partially true.  Kind of. Theres a grain of truth in it in that its easy to radicalize groups that have been oppressed, mistreated, etc. This is the same basic recruiting tactic that ISIS uses; they find vulnerable people and promise them that they can be apart of something bigger, something greater, somewhere that they can finally belong. - cults have also been known to use this tactic.    But, instead of looking at that and going \"maybe we should treat people better, show them basic human kindness and respect.

Anyways, ALL YOU NEED to know is that change starts when you start loving yourself again. Throw everything you heard about yourself away and start to think positively about yourself. Even if it's just looking at a mirror and thinking \"yea I'm good looking\" or anything that's up bringing DO THAT, it may feel super weird and so promise it's gonna b me weird for a while cuz it still is for me and all that but it does change. I'm a completely different person from what I was around 4 months ago. I have confidence now and it's amazing. I can walk up to people and actually talk. Every change starts with yourself. It may be cringe in the beginning to compliment yourself but doing this is something amazing that everyone feeling low should acquire.

            "input": "A little story time. Who's up for some context?!    This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way.    One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her \"Jill.\" We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman.    Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started.    Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke.    The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other.    She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. \"I missed talking to you,\" \"It feels like it's been so long since we talked,\" et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. \"I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck.\" Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just \"No you're not\" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that.    I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* \"You know I have a life outside of you, right?\", but then again... maybe I should've?    Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation (\"I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that\") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago.    Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net), blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on.    Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while.    Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social.    Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her \"Claire\") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net). Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say \"hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon.\"    She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, \"Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year.\"    So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating.    TL;DR: Extremely clingy and codependent friend drove me off because she didn't respect that I needed space, and she's still clinging to me over a year after we stopped talking.",

This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex.    It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice.    For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying \"you've never successfully performed this challenge\", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail.

I eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (Artella.com). This was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. At this point I was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.     Getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, I really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most VFX houses). Someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/VFX.    You tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. I was fully aware of that when I was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. But I wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. Sure there are people that grow out it, but I've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.

            "input": "Background: 21 years old, chubby, friendless, haven't kissed a girl or even held her hand yet. I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things I should've had experienced by now & that it's probably too late to catch up.    Every day is as boring as the previous one. If someone was looking at me all day, all they would see would be some fat guy sitting in front of a gigantic screen with a poker face.    It's sad, man. Every year I feel like it's too late to change, only to regret not having tried one year later. I wish I could go back in time and tell 17 years old me that no, it's not too late to get in shape, as you'll still wish to be ripped when you're 21. Or go back and tell 18 years old me that it is too early to give up any hopes of ever kissing a girl or having a social life. The list goes on. But sadly, I can't change my past.    What's even more depressing is that it is pretty much entirely my fault. Yes, I do have overprotective parents, but I should have done something. If only I had told them to fuck off whenever they asked where I was going, with who, and that endless amount of questions they asked (and still ask) me every time I opened the door, my life could have been a lot more different.    Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed.    Right after waking up, I saw her reply. She answered 10 minutes after I knocked myself out. Said she was at some club and told me to drop by if I wanted. A few minutes later, she mentioned that she was going to the beach later if I wanted to go. And that she was leaving the town we both were at at a certain hour.    What did I do? I saw the message an hour before she said she would leave (in the notification panel with my phone in flight mode so she wouldn't know I saw it) and answered an hour after she left with some crappy excuse as to why I couldn't answer earlier. Even though I really wanted to see her.    My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all.    It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal. And I'd love to go to nightclubs, but I don't have the social skills to really enjoy it.    I've recently tried to lose weight again, successfully. Lost 6% bodyfat but I 'gave up' again two weeks ago. I'm struggling once again with the false belief that it's too late to improve. That the door has already closed. The same dumb questions arise: \"Why would I want to be ripped at 22? Will I even be able to catch up with social skills? Will it even be worth it?\".    Any advice is welcome.",

We (I am one as well) are a real thing, it's determined by your nervous system, which in HSPs is more developed than average. Almost 20% of people are HSP's and also there happen to be highly sensitive ones among animals. It serves a purpose, because they are more sensitive not only emotionally, but also sensually, so they are more likely to notice if something is wrong. Highly sensitive animals are the guards because of that. It used be so with humans before we could depend on technology to be safe and sound. Anyway, I consider high sensibility as some super power and with great power comes great responsibility.  I'm not implying that you are HSP, but doing some research on that topic might be really helpful, because HSPs and Ausies share a lot in characteristics. I hope I helped at least a little",

Personally, I'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite AAP gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential AGP/AAP behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.",

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

Dysphoria is the will to be the opposite gender and transgender is the will to be the opposite gender. You might notice that it is the same thing. It is like calling the size of paper a \"non-ledger tabloid\" (don't get me started about paper sizes)    3. It makes dysphoria meaningless. Thousands of people are dysphoric and suffer from it. Even the broad dysphoria definition proposed ontop can cause psychological problems. Why make the word meaningless?    4. (mostly a counter to point 6) most transphobic people's argument is \"you gender is unrelated to how you feel\". The word Dysphoria helps people understand that it is a quantifiable studied phenomenon. What do you think will generate more transphobia, saying gender is a feeling or saying gender is a mental state.    5. I don't believe in cultural appropriation but I assume the Tumblr person does.

She mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash.    Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin.    Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.     If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level.    **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from \"unconditional love\" to \"social contract\" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. If you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.",

A lot of more sympathetic posts appeared and instead of hiding them or whatever people started badgering the mods and arguing with each other. There are four other subs to discuss the Duggars and yet people insist on going on r/duggarssnark. I don't get it.  One of the mods was harassed so much they left. There is now constant trolling for absolutely no reason.     I do think a big issue is that people don't get how reddit works. You can hide posts and block people, downvotes and upvotes mean nothing.  I get downvoted all the time, I don't agree with some of the posts so I hide them. Am I neutral? No because there once again 4 other subs on reddit, facebook groups, instagram accounts, forums etc. that are neutral. It is just one sub and people can't let it be.",

The OBGYN that delivered most of my kids was pregnant twice when my wife was.  Yet there is a fallacy in pointing to her.  Everyone knows that the world would be better with more women like her.  Yet making it easier to accomplish what she did doesn't make more women like her, it just lowers the bar.  It's like pointing to a remarkable immigrant to justify more immigration.  It neglects the way selection works.        > huge daycare costs and minimal maternal and no paternal leave. I think improving the childcare system in this country would help a lot more women be able to be both a parent and a doctor. Can we at least agree on that?        No.  It would be better for women to stay home and raise their own children.  There is no need for half of doctors to be women.  That is just a silly, pointless objective.  Instead, we should just focus on relaxing the regulations that make cost of living high.  The only reason daycare is expensive in some places is that there are absurd levels of regulation.  Every time a child gets hurt, the state rushes in to impose laws to ensure it never happens again.  That might sound nice, and that's why it happens, but another way of stating that series of events is outlawing low cost child care.  Instead, we should let the market offer a variety of products and let parents choose.  Daycare has low startup costs and therefore can be very competitive.  There are already plenty of incentives to provide safe care without the intervention of regulators who don't pay the costs they impose.  The same goes for vehicles, homes, medicine, and many other products/services.  People should be allowed to choose the quality of product that they want or offer.

I am now currently a sophomore year going into junior year.    I grew up with engineering drilled into my brain. My dad is an engineer, and as a little kid I always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. I excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when I moved into a bit more average.    I then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. I quickly realized how much I hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a D in both Calculus 3 (Taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry II, got into academic probation. I then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my GPA up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing Statics with a F. I honestly feel very annoyed.    I'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking Engineering isn't right for me. I literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. I hate going back to school, rather irritated each time I have to go back. I hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. I hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. The thing I hate most? Tests. Why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? I don't know which other major I can be interested at.    Most people I'm around with are rather shitty, or I just don't fit in with them. I am losing multiple friends back in home, and I'm not making any true friends in college. I'm always open to hanging out, but it's always like this: \"I'm busy, sorry.\" Or some version of that. Or they just don't respond at all. I always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. I also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that I bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least I have a freaking car to use, right?    Why do I have to be that kid who peaked in high school? Back then when I had a girlfriend, was a sports team captain, always have fun stuff to do. Now I'm just sitting here with a low GPA and have not exercised in so long because of engineering work.    I'm fucking irritated. I've been noticing I got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all I want to do is to yell \"FUCK ENGINEERING\" in my brain. Why can't I just get my shit together? I hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but I loathe almost every single math and science courses I take. I loathe calculus and linear analysis. I loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did I let GPA dictate my happiness? And otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 GPA minimum required? It's a very stupid requirement to have, just seeing all those people who cheated their way being eligible for that job.    Feel free to ask me any more questions.",

Things don't go as planned. And I have to rely on an aide. But its just part of being in a relationship with me. I don't want to be a responsibility. I want to be a boyfriend.",

So he risked his life and fraught through a whole army single handed to get his lord's son back. Liu bei was so touched by his action that he felt nothing could be worth risking such a loyal man of talent. Him throwing his son to the ground is an outburst of emotion over how grateful he is to the general. He didn't actually throw him, he got stopped in time (or Zhao Yun caught the baby). Either way, a baby wasn't hurt    Literary analysis of the scene is actually pretty interesting, since there is a school of thought that presumes Liu bei to be a master manipulator.

            "input": "u/Elainepaige123 So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules.    My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job.    He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. He also said that I was his best friend, which is when I fell hard, because I've never had a best friend. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere.    He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better.    I asked for a better explanation, but he said, \" listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!\" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, \"alrighty.\". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood.    That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me?    or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all.    I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. He kept telling me I looked \"devastated\" the last time I saw him. I was not mentally well, because I felt like I was morally wrong. I used to send him long messages every so often explaining my emotions and then regret it later, but he said he was okay with it. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person.    TL;DR guy that I fell in love with says he loves me, then dumps me after taking my virginity. Haven't heard from him since.",

One reply:    > In  a communist system, there should be alternative ways for you to take  such an initiative. There should be institutions setup to make sure you  have the resources and labor power necessary to accomplish your  productive/distributive goals. This would massively increase innovation  and creativity within society and allow for the complete transition to  full communism. Until we setup these kinds of institutions, full  communism remains theoretical.    So hiring workers in a normal capitalist system isn't adequate enough; therefore government has to step in, and possibly force workers in there if necessary.     But having an \"adequate\" number of workers means that the owner no longer owns the means of production ...    That proposal is not only insanely inefficient and counterproductive, but it also provides an excuse for the government to steal the owner's stuff and enslave him or her some more.

That number is increasing yearly. 2015 was the first year when the number of elephants being killed was more than those being born. If this disparity continues, African elephants could face extinction within our lifetime. In Asia, though poaching for ivory is a serious problem as well, elephants are also being killed for their skin. Whereas in Africa only elephants with ivory are killed, every Asian elephant is a target for their skin which means that they could face extinction sooner than African elephants. Additionally, in Asia, many elephants are facing an unnatural and cruel life by also being kept in captivity for a variety of purposes: logging, tourism, cultural and religious activities, and transportation.",

They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some \"forced diveristy\" issues that has [completely tanked their sales](https://youtu.be/9CnTDE2zZU0) (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.    More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh](https://youtu.be/ZA_DNrV6izw). Even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which [she has been accused of before](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/brie-larson-basmati-blues-white-saviour-role-attack-criticism-actress-india-cinema-a8057001.html). Gotta pay those bills though, I guess.    The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive \"incels are back to ruin CM\" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.    The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider \"woke\". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the  \"SJWing\" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels. The fact that the film has moments that would even make the recent Gillette commercial blush isn't helping lol",

[https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bxesqn/babies\\_born\\_with\\_severe\\_mental\\_disabilities/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bxesqn/babies_born_with_severe_mental_disabilities/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)         I have a sister who passed away a few years ago in her mid 50's...never married, never having children. She was physically disabled with a birth defect, although she had a college degree and was mostly independent. But she never dated, never had relationships. She was extremely lonely and isolated. She was in so much physical pain as well, and was completely addicted to pain medication. (oxycontin, etc) This is after a lifetime of surgeries (over 75-80 of them) and hospital stays. Unlike most with severe mental disabilities, my sister KNEW how screwed up her life was. She HATED it. She contemplated suicide several times. She had to be on antidepressants, go through therapy. I can't even imagine what would have happened to her if she had been born to a family who couldn't have afforded the best for her.           The point of all of this is this. As a sister of a loved one who had to call life and death....literally...3 times for my sister's life and watch her go through hell and back, there is no way in hell I would ever NOT abort a fetus if I found out my baby had the same disability. And yes, we had to screen carefully when I was pregnant as I have 2 siblings with this disability. (the other sibling died as an infant) I live in a state passing a heartbeat law, and it pisses me off to no end that these religious political zealots put no value on the quality of life. I would never want any loved one of mine going through what my sister went through.          I have family members who post shit on Facebook every day, praising these new laws. I want to smack them, or call them out. These are the same damn family members who didn't visit my sister ever when she needed them most.          I miss her every, single day.

Basically, it's a toss-up over whether you go for pure damage and some risk over guaranteed solid damage and no risk. There is no right or wrong answer to this. Just how willing are you to play the odds on 85% accuracy is all.",

To be honest the worst issues I've had come from the more... vocal, steadfast members of the community in general - That's where you'll find 'militant' gays as I like to term them - ones who think bisexuals and transgender people are cheating and aren't included. Which is folly; the one thing we all have in common is discrimination based on a circumstance of birth, it's so sad to see some people in the community act like 'people have to accept me but you cannot be any lower than this or you're scum'.

They even have a book dedicated to the symbology they use that I think is posted online. They make *heavy* use of symbolism and are just great to listen to.     The Catcher in the Rye is a fun book. It uses symbolism and it has story elements you may not pick up on until you experience them yourself. Also it's short.    Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, The Metamorphosis, Heart of Darkness, Othello are all some examples of books I've personally enjoyed and know there are a lot of resources into their symbolism. I tried to think of varied examples that don't carry on too long.    Edit- Forgot to add. A lot of the time I don't know what symbols mean right away, either. I just happen to notice \"oh hey that's the third time we've seen a white bird\" and *then* do some reading or research to see if it means something in the context of the story or what.

The theory is that since \"everyone is sad and lonely\", they've been brainwashed into loving Pikachu because Pikachu is portrayed as being an eternal friend.    Further, they're arguing that this is similar to the way conspiracy-style communities recruit people. As that [flat-earther documentary on Netflix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8132700/) showed, a major recruiting point for 'crazy' groups is the companionship of a community. Lonely people often gravitate towards these kinds of groups because they're more willing to accept outsiders, and are more tolerant of deviant behaviour.    That in itself is accurate, but using it to describe why people like Pikachu is pretty crazy. People like Pikachu because it's a cute critter, which is brave, fun to watch, and (usually) reminds us of our childhoods.",

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

About 5 months ago after spreading myself incredibly thin trying to solve everyone else's problems in my clan, I meet someone who seems to just click with me.    No name but a letter. Anime pic. Everything should have told me this is a catfish.    But I was so fucking lonely.    It comes to be this person happens to be extremely rich on Runescape, and offered to give me 20 bonds for gold premier.    The catch? I had to give them the 7 bonds I had already, because \"It'll be a better gift if I give you all 20!\"    Of course I do so without thinking.    Trade complete.    B has left the clan. B has logged off.    I'm just sitting there staring at those words on my screen.    This must be a prank, right? No one would do that, be nice to someone then backstab them as soon as they get something, right?    10 minutes pass. I haven't moved. One of my friends PM's me \"Why are you on that world?\"    All I could manage to say was \"I don't know.\"    I'd just gotten scammed because I was thinking with my dick.    I can't show my face to my clan anymore. They'll never let me live it down. I can't handle that. I'm supposed to be the clan mediator who helps everyone resolve issues. Not the completely broken mask that it actually is.    So I left. Never logged in again. On anything. Totally off the grid save my job.    A month goes by. My phone blares notifications at me... \"Naive we miss you.\" \"Naive, hope you're okay.\" \"Naive what happened?\" \"Naive we're really worried.\"    Lies. All lies.    About a month and a half ago, I finally summon the energy to go to the doctor. I just tell her right out I'm depressed. She prescribes me 200mg Bupropion, twice daily.    So now I'm on medication for depression. Doesn't feel like anything.    Until 3 weeks ago.    All of a sudden, I'm a completely different man. Garulous, entertaining, genuinely fun to talk to. Came back to my clan ecstatic. Things are looking good for once.    Except when you didn't agree with me.    Then I was the absolute hugest asshole in existence. Because how DARE someone try to harsh my happiness?    So I treat them like I would any other asshole. I mocked them. I poked fun at all the words they say. And when they inevitably fight back, I get underhanded. Start slinging shit that was told to me in confidence.    Of course they respond in kind. And then I played the victim. Dissected their words and arguments, completely contradicting myself at times just to win the argument.    Oh I won the arguments. But now the entire clan hates me. They don't even acknowledge me when I speak in the clan.    I've become *that* guy. The one you have to tip toe around on eggshells because he might snap and bite your head off.    I've become the crazy one.    I'm not fixed. Sure I'm no longer depressed.    But I've never felt more isolated than I do in this very moment.    They just wrote me off. I can't blame them. No one wants to deal with someone whose perception of reality is this fucked.    No one wants to hear out why I'm saying the things I say. No one is acknowledging that I said I need another break from Discord. No one cares.    So I left. Again.    I shouldn't be around people. I'm trash. Filth. The worst kind of asshole, the one that *has* to be right.    Don't end up like me. If you were depressed and now feel almost insanely good, see your doctor.

(WRIC) \u2014 A Chesterfield family spoke with 8News Friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on South Twilight Lane the night before. The intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds.    The incident was a traumatic experience for the Lewis family's first night in their brand new home.      \"She was in to kill us,\" Melissa Lewis said. \"That was her almighty, to kill us. She attacked us and I held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as I possibly could.\"    The Lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over.    \"I said 'who are you?\" Lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. \"She said 'I need your help, please help me.' I said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'I'm the devil.'\"      The homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on July 4. The family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave.    \"She looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke,\" Lewis's husband told 8News.    Fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. With his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. None of the shots struck the suspect.    Lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength.    \"She was not stopping,\" he said. \"She had the strength of four grown men.\"    When he ran out of bullets, Lewis began throwing furniture at her. His wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. The intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the Lewis' 12-year-old son Logan, shoved a wrench into her neck.      Police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. The Lewis family left with bruises and bite marks.    \"I'm scared to go in there, I won't even go into any room by myself, I'm terrified,\" M. Lewis said.    Detectives told the family that the suspect lives nearby and will eventually be charged robbery, breaking and entering and attempted murder. She is currently in the ICU with severe head trauma.",

While I'm sure that there are trans women in \"trap\" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. In that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to \"trick\" men, so it's an accurate description. Finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.",

Fucker sunbathes on the patio in direct sun when it's over 100F and comes in all hot like he's a coal you put in the fire.    Seriously though. People love to complain about the heat here, but it's not that bad. You adjust your schedule and clothing with the weather, much like people do when they live someplace that it snows.",

Neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue I faced at the time (I don't quite remember why I went when I was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).

That's probably not enough, so whatever party gets elected in future will have to raise corporate taxes again to keep the national debt under control. But that's not my problem because I'll be out of office by then.    Is this a good deal for corporations?",

Of course the first response of liberal idiots after this is to seek to find a leftist scalp to make everything 'fair'. Literally a moment cannot pass without us being stabbed in the back by liberals so that they can do some moralistic both sides garbage. And afterwards the right just literally spits at them in the face, like it never once in history has satisfied the right. The appeasement doesn't make them any happier or more grateful to the idiot liberals, it just becomes another tool in their box they can use in their attempt to destroy humanity. And then of course they stick their nose down to their ass and sniff deeply and boast about how 'fair they were' when though they're 'a progressive too'.     Do the idiot liberals care? No. Because they are fucking cucks incapable of anything. If there were five rightists and a billion liberals, the nation would inevitably become the successor to nazi Germany. Liberalism is the ideology of weakness, it knows no strategy but appeasement.    Unlike the rightists though, we will not run to our billionaires and massive propaganda machine and whine and cry endlessly. We will continue on unphased, we will organize. Until victory, always.

It is hard to find a man that really seems to want a serious relationship which guarantees marriage, you must know yourself how MUCH HARDER it is when half the boys don't even give you a chance.       You said that life is fleeting, enjoy every opportunity instead of chasing a prince on a horse, because whatever you might believe of yourself, you can make no good judgement on which unlikely relationship will turn into *that one*. Nobody likes incertainty, nobody likes to talk of serious shit when they don't even know the person well, even less so if they don't know the person well and the person is also someone in your case. Give every improbable relationship a chance of knowing you AND put NO pressure on it. No obe wants to hear the stranger they've been dated for 3 weeks is dead-serious about long-term commitment and has more string attached than a corset.        And in case you might start with 'You don't understand'... well, you might not actually understand it either. It is easy to be isolated, refused, frail, and to think you have had all the time in the world to know how things work. It is easy to let the hatred or spite that grows from the feeling of injustice get the better of you. It is also easy to let yourself down. The world is not as naked when you don't have the full picture, even less when you think you had it because of overthinking and over-analysing stuff.       Good things will come for you once you let yourself open. But to let yourself open you need not to let yourself down, not to think you understand the world, relationships and partners as well as you might do, and especially, you need to take the risk of losing time and offering yourself a chance with people that might not appear as commited as you wish, even if it is not what you think you want.",

            "input": "We first got the internet in our house in 1998; I was 12. The first website I visited was TheForce.Net; the second was a porn site. I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect \u2014 and safe \u2014 release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15.    Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test \u2014 I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.     I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.     I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things \u2014 namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem.    Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn \u2014 streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.     A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing. The next time I see a naked woman is gonna be when she's standing right in front of me, however long it takes.     I'm done jerking myself into a coma, just like I'm done hiding from the world. I don't deserve to be treated this way *by my own self*, let alone anybody else. My mission to improve my life has gained a new facet and an extra shot in the arm. Telling my story on a public forum such as this is my way of owing it and drawing the dividing line between the past and the future. Thanks for reading.    tl;dr: Masturbated daily for twenty two years, used it as a crutch to avoid my anxiety, ran my social life into the ground, but fuck both of those things now. I'm in therapy and I'm gonna go out there and get mine.",

My last dog wasn't an ESA but he was a trained therapy dog. I say \"trained\" but he was a 3 pound long-hair chihuahua who already loved cuddles so it was mostly I who was trained.

Agreed as well. Everyone's health concerns deserve to be taken into account and I do not envy the people who have to figure those things out.     But like you said, clearer rules are needed.

This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \\*19 Kids and Counting\\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \\*Counting On\\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive.         This subreddit drama focuses on r/DuggarsSnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the Duggar family. However, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes \"leghumping.\" Leghumping is fawning over or praising the Duggars, which is not allowed on the sub. Some people believe positive observations (ex: Her hair looks better than usual) or explaining behavior (ex: Is it normal to eat casserole all the time? Yes, that is normal in some regions) are forms of leghumping, while other people do not believe so.         **Original Post**    [A regular user posted a meme aimed at leghumpers, people in the comments don't like being characterized as leghumpers, there is a fight about what constitutes leghumping](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/atypz2/the_leghumping_pests_infesting_this_sub/eh4f65x)         [The user then decides to leave the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au31u8/im_ready_to_move_on/)         [A different user creates a discussion themed subreddit to supplement the snark subreddit, snark fans tell him to leave](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au3ifq/rduggardiscourse/eh6knwl)         [The two main mods (one now deleted) attempt to clarify \"leghumping\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au5h9h/message_from_the_mods/eh5rlrg)         [A less active mod makes their own post (now deleted) to clarify \"leghumping,\" using a definition that allows positive comments and explaining to be posted.

The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pa.    This is what I had read initially and had thought all 1014 answered each question, I hadn't seen the specific vote counts. That's my mistake, though I don't think an n of that size necessarily renders a poll worthless, and I still stand by my view that \"nobody supports them except those in the group\" is an exaggeration, and a potentially dangerous one at that.     I also want to point out that the concern isn't so much the people that some people may currently support neonazism or white supremacy, it's those who aren't necessarily in that world but are susceptible to brainwashing and propaganda. Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses \u2014 find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that \u2014 it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.    ^just to be clear, this is in a generic \"you\", I'm not accusing you of any of this    > hit in the head with a baton or bat    I hope it's clear that I don't condone this whatsoever. And this isn't okay regardless of the victims political affiliation.    > majority of people agree it's bad, which is not the case with the things antifa does.    But in order for this to be at all relevant \u2014 you would have to believe that antifa is exactly as bad as all the white supremacists and neonazis that I linked. Again, can you point to any political assassinations or murders by antifa? Or any things that are directly parallel to *any* of the stories I linked?    I'm also *very* doubtful that most people don't disagree with antifa in general, let alone specifically the violent actions.    > The difference between supporting assholes.    Do you think all assholes are created equal or something? Would a guy who gets road rage and brake checks you be as much of an asshole as a guy who leaves his 2 year old child in the car while he gets smashed at the club, crashes head on and kills 5 people including his child?        People don't have to think about these things in a completely black and white way. You can agree with a particular groups intentions and motivations without condoning all of their actions. Just because two groups do bad things does not by nature of that make them equally immoral.      The hoax stuff is interesting and probably worth exploring but not sure how it relates to this stuff.",

            "input": "For background, I (25M) have been with my current girlfriend (21F) for nearly 2 years, and we have been going pretty well in terms of everything major. We rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me.      I can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but I honestly don't see her doing so. She smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. She has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. Because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and I feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. She is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. She is insistent on having children in the future, but I can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. She does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but I don't believe her because I have seen how low her depression can pull her down.      As for some background on myself, I'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, I occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. I also have a lot of creative art hobbies that I do from time to time. My view on recreational drugs is quite lax, I am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. What I am willing to say is that I also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but I'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity.       Since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. There is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. This will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which I'm not the greatest fan of.       I have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when I try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress.      I honestly love my girlfriend, and I can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. I would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself,  I feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger.      I really don't know how to approach the matter, and I have been thinking about this for the longest time. I can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. I can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but I would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out.      I just wanted this off my chest, I didn't come here for advice, but suggestions or comments about my/her lifestyle will be read. Thanks for reading.",

I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home.    One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that.    He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him \"go home. You have a kid.\" He told me \"I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you.\" He said he didn't do all this for anyone.    Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens.     But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen.    Before I left, he told me \"the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music.\" Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself.     It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise.    I love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and I will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. It's more than that. He saved me.    Thank you. If you're out there somewhere.",

Chicago does appear to have more corruption than other cities, but it's also quite possible they're just really shitty at cover ups.  Reporting on police misbehavior drives clicks, reporting on police *good* behavior does not, so whatever you see on the news is always going to give a much more bleak view of the police than actual statistics will, even if there is variance between cities in terms of the percentage of police interactions that go poorly, which there *always* will be.

            "input": "There is nothing remotely racist about this post.     Blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... But, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of America. Also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. Therefore, I suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in North America, probably less than 1% of them are black.     Why bring this up? My point here is that Bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. This may provoke certain responses by a Sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as:    1. Confusion;  2. Fear;   3. Trepidation; and  4. Curiosity    I believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage.  All of these potential responses will cause a Bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not.     The fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. Chances are better than not that when a Squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. It may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare.    As a practical matter I think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. See how the Squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. I am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so I will be very interested to see the results.     There are all sorts of variations on this concept. The goal here is to throw a Bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. The idea is to create a weird scene in an area where Bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. At the same time, you want it to perplex the BF to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. While this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the Sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head.     Here are some other ideas I have to cause a Bigfoot to pause due to confusion:     1. Outdoors sex/orgy: Get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a Bigfoot hotspot. This will really pique a scratch's interest. At some point a Squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out!     2. Poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. It probably will take longer to attract a Squatch.     3. Strange looking people: these are people that Squatch are not used to seeing. For example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins.     4. Fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. The noise and weird scene will generate some Bigfoot interest.     Some believe that Sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. I think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. Confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. Therefore, we take the Squatch's advantage away from it. This will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.",

Spray painting a swastika on the side of a building is a hate crime.     >    > The first major problem we run into, then, is that the vast majority of recorded hate crimes fall into a number of activities that normally fall under misdemeanor or even civil categories. These actions include vandalism, simple assault and a vague category the FBI uses called \"Crimes Against Society.\" Vandalism alone makes up a third of all events. It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation. The aforementioned swastika spray paint is no more difficult to clean off than a person scrawling their name.     >    > Digging further, the increase in reported hate crimes is driven primarily by these non-criminal acts.     >    > The disparity between real crime where people are harmed or property is irreparably lost and simple misdemeanor activity is staggering.     >    > An indicator hate crime isn't a problem is the rise of the hate crime hoax. According to researcher Wilfred Reilly, a Kentucky State professor of political science, there has been a [notable rise in hate crime hoaxes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hate-crime-hoaxes-are-more-common-than-you-think-11561503352).     >    > In today's United States, there is immense value in becoming a victim of a hate crime.

One doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen. But one does need to raise awareness if they wish to have their 15 minutes of fame.     >    > [As I previously noted](https://mises.org/wire/combat-hate-make-government-weaker), the number of people who buy into hate ideology, regardless of motivation, is so trivial that they couldn't even fill a minor league baseball stadium. There are more people than this who think the Earth is flat, yet no one considers that a growing trend. It would be impossible to casually talk about Nazis being evil if they had any semblance of power or authority as people would tread more carefully. Being anti-Nazi is a safe and easy way to win social points since there is almost zero risk of reprisal. Just ask Wilfred Reilly, who is on actual enemies lists, just how dangerous they are (they aren't).

My grandparents owned a large chunk of and island with 4 cabins in Georgian Bay. This was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. And we did. My grandparents loved having everyone up, and everyone loved being up there. The big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven. When it was my grandparents cottage, their 3 kids were equal in how many times you could go up, the rules were the same, and everyone was welcome whenever they wanted.     Everything changed when my grandparents passed away.    My grandfather had cancer which took over his body quickly. So while he was still alive he put the cottage on sale, and we all went up one more time. It was nice closure. We all said our goodbyes to this place that held so many memories in our hearts. And then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. They promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. But that wasn't realistic. Their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. If their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. If my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies. I don't have an issue with this, because it's their cottage. What I have an issue with is the constant stream of Instagram stories and posts every weekend of them renovating cabins, photos of the sunsets, or photos of them relaxing on the dock. Recently they posted a photo of them driving around in a boat that was so sentimental to my grandfather he never let any drive it. And there they were in bikinis and drinks sitting on the back driving it around. Seeing all of this makes me upset. They have every right to enjoy their own cottage, but it's just insensitive of them to constantly post about their great weekends up there when the other 2 families who used to enjoy the same things only get to see it through a smartphone.    I just wish they would be able to enjoy their new cottage without having to show all of us how much fun they're having. Without showing us how each cabin is now one child's mini house. How a cottage which could hold over 20 people can now only fit 8. I want to forget about this place, but I can't. I'm constantly being reminded of my grandparents and feeling huge waves of nostalgia.",

I've known her since sophomore year, and now we're both seniors. I'm graduating in 2.5 months, but she's staying for a 5th year. Most of my friends are juniors or staying for a 5th year, so it's going to be really tough for me to leave my friends behind. My college friends are like my family.    I've also helped C through a nasty breakup with one of her previous girlfriends. Because of this, I was happy for her when she got her new girlfriend last year, but now I think things have gotten weird.    She literally spends all her time with her girlfriend. Like always. Even though C lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and I know this pisses off C's actual roommate. C's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in.    C has just gradually stopped talking to me. She even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. Sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on Facebook and I'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read.    Sometimes, I'll see C's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if I've ever heard from C, because they haven't. Because of this I know this isn't something C's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends.    I'm happy that C is happy in her relationship, but I'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before I leave campus. I haven't seen her in months, and I'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, I may not see her again before I graduate    **Thanks for reading.

If people can sit back and label goddamn golf, which is the boringest fucking sport in the world, a goddamn sport, if you can label that shit as a sport, and if you can label goddamn fishing as a sport, I know damn well you can label jacking off a sport. Think about it, what the fuck athletically are you really doing in golf, my guy? All you doing is hitting a goddamn golf club, \"Oh my God man, that's a long ass birdie man, nice birdie, nice putt, man it went 250 yards.\" Get the fuck outta here, nobody care about that boring ass shit. Who the fuck really watches golf, my dude? Nobody gives a fuck, it makes everybody fall asleep. Fishing on the other hand, what the fuck are you really doing athletically, my guy, in fishing? All you're doing is that you're sitting your bitch ass up in a boat, usually it's old ass snagger-teeth motherfuckers that ain't got no goddamn teeth up in they fucking grill, or up in they mouth. They're just sitting up the goddamn boat, you know what I'm saying. Throwing a goddamn rod. It can be any kind of goddamn bait up on the end of the rod. It can be a worm, it can be a caterpillar, it can be a centipede, it can be a dead ass butterfly, it can be a fucking beak of a damn bird, it can be a fucking, it can be anything, you know what I'm saying? \"Oh my God! We caught a big ass salmon, reel that fat bitch in, yeah.\" Motherfucker, what are you doing athletically? How the fuck is that working up a sweat, my dude? What, you're working out your arms, because you have to reel that motherfucker in? Man, that's not a sport, dawg. Well, fuck it. You know what, it is a sport. Fuck it. You guys want to consider that shit to be a sport? Jacking off is a fucking sport to me. Jacking off and beating your motherfucking dick to porn is a sport. There's two damn things that you have to do. A. You build up a sweat. Well actually, you don't have to do shit. There's basically two things that goes down, that's what I meant to say. A. You're building up a sweat. I don't give a fuck man, if you are building up a sweat, goddamn it, that's shit is considered a sport. You're building up a sweat. Number 2, and the most important part of that shit, is that your hand is getting a workout. Your hand is getting a workout, man, you are building up your arm strength, and you are building up your hand strength, okay. I don't know about you, dude, but when I'm beating my shit, man, my fucking hand muscles get fucking tight, you know what I'm saying? And that shit wears the fuck out of my entire left arm. I used to be able to do it with my right hand, can't do that shit, so I do it with my left hand. So, in my personal opinion, do you guys consider jacking off a sport? Man, in my opinion, I believe it is. So I know with some of you trolling ass fuckin bitches are gonna say \"Oh, man, you must not get no pussy, motherfucker, if you jack off.\" Motherfucker, let's be real, okay? Everybody has jacked off once in they goddamn life. If you gonna sit back, and you gonna come on my video, and troll my shit, say \"Oh, Jimmy, I never jacked off once in my life.\" Bitch, stop lying. Everybody does this shit, okay? So please miss me with that bullshit, dude, and go preach that shit to somebody who fucking is actually gonna listen to you, okay? Number 2, \"Oh my God, this comment was stupid. It was pointless.\" Couldn't've been that stupid, bitch, you still read it! You know what I'm saying? All the motherfuckers that's reading this, man, you saw the first sentence of the fucking comment before you read this shit. So it couldn't've been that damn stupid if you still proceeded to click on the motherfucker. So, jacking off. The shit's a sport, fuck it. ?",

He was providing prostitutes for potential investors (this is a bit political theater because everyone knows Korea is rampant with prostitution even though its illegal and the government doesn't do anything about it)    But also the security at his club was apparently helping VIPs drug girls and bring them back to the VIP rooms for sex/rape.    In addition to this, private messages from a chat group got leaked that involved multiple high profile people in the music industry chatting and talking about actually going out and raping girls (directly using the korean word for rape) and one was sharing secret videos of his sexcapades (which is a WHOLE other issue in Korea since they ban real porn sites so people share illegally filmed spy camera porn and such) including prefacing some of them saying that he was only filming because she was passed out because he knew she would say no. One of the girls involved is in Twice.    So with this, everything associated with Seungri and the others is fairly barren. His label owns some restaurants that feature some YG branding and they are totally empty, and the ramen shops franchised under his Aori Ramen brand are also virtually empty all the time.    Shits wild. Like, when you see crazy western feminists call America a rape culture, on so many of those points, Korea LEGITIMATELY is a rape culture in so many ways.",
