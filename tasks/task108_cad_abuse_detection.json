    "Definition": "Read the given text and if the the context is Identity Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which contains a negative statement made against an identity. An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) or Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) or Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) or Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.), indicate via \"yes\". Otherwise, response via \"no\".",

When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons.    This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation.    With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding.    In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.",

But don't delete and ban people that actually bring something to the table just because you don't like them. It seems unfair to be banned over a mod not liking you.",

You had these huge families where everyone was related to at least one person, and that's ended up inescapably propagating down the line because most people are still living and marrying in the same part of the state their ancestors were. It's also why the LDS church keeps a huge geneology database - back when it was established they were trying to figure out who was related to who.    Anecdotally my brother married a distant cousin without realizing it (their kids are fine fortunately), and I've got some other cousins who are having a lot of children with cleft palates and hip dysplasia problems, and I suspect they're probably related on some level as well. 2-3% increase in birth defects doesn't seem like it's so bad until you see it happening to people you know and you see the pain and  the costs.    That said, they have every right to keep having kids as is the mormon wont, and they'll just keep paying for the surgeries on infants. I suppose it's similar for other people who find they're both at an increased risk for deformity even without the ancestral relations.        https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/31/us/by-accident-utah-is-proving-an-ideal-genetic-laboratory.html",

And i get a 65%. In the car, my dad asks about it. I say I got a 65, which was better than last time, and not an F but a D, and I got my last exam score (55%) replaced with this one. Dad asks what I have in thr class, and I say 75%.    Mom says \"you might want to rethink being a chem major if you can't do community college level chemistry.\" I'm 17, in high school, and I'm going to a local community college through a program my school offers. She has already brought it up before, and I was really doubting myself. I just say \"haha yeah..\" because I don't really know what else to say. Its been hard motivating myself and finding a goal I want to achieve, but being a biochem major and getting my bachelors degree in Science is the one goal I've made for myself. Its what I've been working with in mind for the last 2 years at this college. I almost have my Associates. And now my mom is telling me I can't achieve my goal.     My dad says \"no no she can do it, it will take a little work, but she can do it. Everything takes work.\" I don't say anything because I don't want my mom to keep going on about it. Last time she talked about this, I was in the car by myself with her, so I just had to sit and listen to her tell me I'm not good at chemistry, wasn't in high school, isn't now, and why do I want to be a chem major when I'm bad at chemistry. But I felt better about having my dad in the car because he usually says something when my mom goes too far with something.     She always used to ask me why I don't have any goals in life, why I don't care. Because whenever I have something I love doing or something I want to work towards, you always walk all over me and make me question whether or not I can do it, whether or not I can do anything.       When I was applying to universities, she said I could apply anywhere, that now was my time to start becoming more mature. She always goes on about how college is my time, my time to do what I want, be who I want to be, and how I can go anywhere.     I said I wanted to apply to UW Seattle.     Yes, perfect!     I guess I can apply to UW Tacoma too. No, you are not applying there!     Why not, it has a small school size which is what I want, it's still University of Washington thats the one school I have always dreamed of going to every since I was a kid.     Because, you are not applying there!!!    I want to apply to both UW's with dorms I've always wanted to go there, XXX (my boyfriend) is going there too!     You know you're not going to be with him when you're in college right, you're not going to be together very long, you know you're not getting married, right? You're going to meet so many new people in college, you think he's not going to meet any new people while he's in college? He's probably met people already (he's a college freshman this year).    She always asks if I have crushes on any of my male friends. Asks if I feel anything for them. If there's something between us. I don't understand why. She's not joking. She's being completely serious. It just makes me uncomfortable. And always makes comments about my boyfriend finding someone else to be with at work or at college.    As I was showing her my prom dress, she said,    Maybe you'll get to wear it in college, some guy might invite you out to a fancy event!    I'm going to prom with my boyfriend and I have never been more exited to go to a school event. I've never gone to school dances, events, anything. But my boyfriend wanted to share a special day with me, and that's what my mom had to say about it.     I wish she could recognize that I'm happy with him, and even though I know it may not last forever, I can hope it will and appreciate the present. Just because you wanted to date a lot in high school and college, doesn't mean I do.     I just needed to vent",

And the more radical they got, I'd still try my best to have a discussion, but before I knew it, I was being labeled a racist neo-Nazi Trump supporter. Got real fucking tired of it.    So I went over to T_D, outright stating I didn't care for Trump and voted Sanders. And you know what? They were cool with it. Why? Because I was chatting with them in *good faith*. I wasn't yet another asshole joining their subreddit to call them Nazis and whatever else. Surprise, surprise, they were all (well, mostly all) happy to have rational, level-headed discussions. We could disagree with each other and still be kind.    That was when I realized I had been blatantly lied to the whole fucking time. And it shouldn't be a surprise--they're people too.

Both of those points aren't necessarily contradictory depending on just how you're viewing them and how you're making those points.    The idea of Piracy not being a lost sale comes from the idea that a number of people who pirate games would not buy it in the first place, and would only play it if they can pirate it. Think teenagers without their own spending money, or people trying out a game because they *can* without paying, but wouldn't bother trying it if they had to pay for it. The idea of it potentially helping comes from these same people enjoying the game and recommending it to other people, who in turn actually pay for the game. Along with some of the people who pirate it enjoying it to the point where they want to support the devs.    Where this comes to potentially hurting the developers, well, the important phrase in the last paragraph is \"a number of people\". As we can see from these threads, the people who wouldn't buy it anyway aren't all of the people who pirate. They may not even be a large portion at all. For example, the people in this thread saying or implying they'll pirate it would otherwise buy the game if it was on Steam. They're doing it to stick it to the man in their eyes, because they *are* lost sales. And they're using the fact they don't want to support the Epic Games Store as a moral excuse.     Essentially, they are valid points, assuming the \"lost sale\" defense is based in reality which I can't comment on. But a lot of these people just want any moral excuse to pirate games and will use whatever feels the most convenient. Instead of just pirating and accepting it's wrong to do, but they don't care.",

Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or \"congenital eunuchs\". In 19th and 20th century medical literature, intersex was referred as true hermaphroditism, female pseudohermaphroditism, and male pseudohermaphroditism reflecting the first taxonomic efforts to classify intersex conditions. These terms are no longer used: terms including the word \"hermaphrodite\" are considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious.    ***    ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]  ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

She mentions being extremely uncomfortable around the large, boisterous 20-somethings staying in her neighbor's apartment (completely understandable given her trauma), but can't see why her elderly neighbors similarly aren't comfortable with a large dog running around in the hallways of their apartment complex off-leash.    Even if OP is willing to stake her reputation on the temperament of her pet, the _threat_ of a large dog wandering around that might without notice jump at/play rough with you in ways that are acceptable with 19-year olds but not with geriatrics is a detriment to her neighbor's quality of life. My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin.    Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.     If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level.    **edit:** Wanted to clarify something because I went from \"unconditional love\" to \"social contract\" in the same paragraph: if you adopt a dog and do the _bare minimum_ to keep it alive, that thing's gonna love the shit out of you. Doesn't matter if it's overweight, sick, or whatever, that poor fuzzball doesn't know any better. If you are not doing these things as a dog owner it is my opinion that you are taking advantage of the poor animal that has placed its trust in you.",

I don't think you are a loser :)    I think by making this post it shows you do want to change, and by having regret over not doing things at the end of the year it shows you want to change as well. That is important, if you don't really have the drive to grow, then you aren't going to.     I don't know where you live, but perhaps there is a community center, or a park? A place for you to walk? Going to a center or a park where there are people could help you make friends, and get exercise as well. If you don't know how to break the ice with someone, giving them a compliment might work, or asking them a question about something they have with them (like, \"oh that's a cool phone, what kind is it?\"). Take the conversation from there (if they seem comfortable with the confrontation). You can't make friends if you don't put yourself out there at least a little.     I also don't know your interests, but go to places where you can find people with similar ones. If you go to a store that has things that interest you, even talking to the employees could help. They probably have an interest in the thing too, and they have to be welcoming to customers, so it is good practice to try talking to them if you are still uncomfortable with the idea of making friends. Also, chatting with people online leads to more practice as well as online friends that can be there for you!    For losing weight, start simple. Don't tell yourself you are going to start going to the gym everyday if you don't think you will, and don't feel bad for knowing how much you can or can't handle. Again, I don't know how chubby you are, but you know yourself. Take a walk everyday, introduce one healthy food into your life (or take away one unhealthy food) every week if diet is a problem for you. And let yourself have a cheat day, it can help you in the long run. If you are scared to work out in public, buy some weights of your own and watch some Netflix while lifting them. Make it somewhat enjoyable so you stick with it, so ooh don't get discouraged for not wanting to follow through. I believe in you!     Good luck to you, friend :D",

I eventually decided to not pursue college as it seemed unnecessary to my career plans, and rather fully focus on personal projects and also work on other people's animated short films (Artella.com). This was a huge help, (but definitely took a while), it got me stuff to put on my reel that looked like feature animation basically. At this point I was constantly sending my work to people in the industry, and getting feedback, redoing, getting more feedback, etc etc.     Getting the job felt like luck, which sucks to say, I really did just apply at the right time, when they really needed people (tends to be late spring/summer for most VFX houses). Someones going to have to take a risk on you, and they wont do that until you know, your confident that your reel is up to standards with modern day animation/VFX.    You tend to see a lot of negative connotations around the industry, and people telling you to get out while you can. I was fully aware of that when I was feeling unmotivated after lots of rejections. But I wouldn't let it get to ya, try the industry for yourself before taking someone else's word for it. Sure there are people that grow out it, but I've seen people that genuinely still love what they're doing even after many many years.

There are many anime styles, but the cute big eyed+ small nose is popular and easy to do. It would be weird if in a simplified style you would make a broader extra detailed nose. The background setting and light matters too. Lighting and shading can affect skintone too. It's one thing if it's realism, but with anime styles you don't have to have realistic proportions ( nobody has huge anime eyes IRL lol). The colors look different on different types of screens and I know this because some of my old work looks very vibrant on my new laptop and kinda washed out on a phone screen. It would be cool if people stopped bitching and let artists enjoy creating art. Most fanart I do is usually unpaid work in my free time. With commissions I tell people to show me the exact color for skin, eyes and hair. I never had any complaints about how I draw poc. However, I don't like how artists are being treated. If you don't draw poc you are racist, if you do you are still racist because they are not dark enough. It's funny how it's perfectly ok to draw white chatacters as black, but if you make a black character a shade too light in a pastel style all hell breaks loose.",

The typology pretty much assumes that everyone is either 100% straight or 100% gay, and just realllly fucked up sexually when it comes to kinks.    Personally, I'd say that with the inclusion of tumblrite AAP gaydens and the acknowledgement of bisexuality being a reason for potential AGP/AAP behavior due to a wider spectrum of attractive features leading to a fetishization of one's own attractive features, it would be a nigh-on perfect system.",

I was stuck in a downward spiral of self pity and loathing and it only made my condition worse.    Something clicked  a couple months ago. I think i realized what i was doing- i had pushed away so many loving individuals while gaining weight and playing too many videogames. I figured that the only person who could help me get out of this loop was myself. I decided i would eat better, go to the gym, and reconnect with those i pushed away.    Back to the pull up- with the help of some buddies i started exercising regularly. When i started, i absolutely hated it. But i kept going to the gym every day, and got stronger and stronger which led to today, i was finally able to do 2 full range of motion pull ups without any kind of resistance band or kip up!    Im really proud of myself for this. Im still a chubby dude (5 foot 8 in, 165 lbs), but its so cool to see myself improve. Just a couple months ago, i was a fat stereotypical asian gamer lookin dude. But a couple days ago, i got complimented on my new (albeit chunky) muscle definition, and goddamn it feels good!    Its not like ive eliminated all my flaws. I still stress eat and sleep too little. I still occasionally try too hard to be the funniest person in the room, and project myself onto others. But its baby steps, ya feel? Slowly but surely, im improving myself!    Its just a fucking pull up but it really means so much more to me. It really feels like ive succeeded at something for the first time in forever. Its the first step towards feeling happy, and normal.      Sorry if this is braggadocious, im just really proud of how far ive come! :)        P.S. if anyone has any tips on eating clean then please help me out! Anything is appreciated :)",

They're both pretty unverifiable. They are how they are because they are.     For example, an evolutionary psychological explanation for getting (sometimes) different outcomes between sexes in spatial/language tests runs along the lines of maybe that's because historically, men needed better spatial skills because they roamed further to hunt while women needed better language skills to mediate conflicts that, as the generally smaller sex, could be fatal for them if they escalate. It's a nice simple theory that makes superficial sense but it can never move past theory because there's simply no way to gather evidence to support it. It's also somewhat reductionist, which is always a warning sign with psychology that something is hinky. If a theory or the outcome of a study doesn't come with at least a dozen caveats, it definitely doesn't encapsulate more than a tiny segment of humanity.",

It's alright if you say the murderer acted like a yandere character would, I'd also say it's cool, albeit a bit cringy, if you're watching a movie or series where a character kills someone over jealously and you call that a yandere.    But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built.    In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label. The problem is that anime culture reached out way outside it's bubble and people that have no idea what the term reffers to started using it wrongly.    A trans person would be someone born in the wrong body, they feel the other gender and have the need to be more like the other gender.    A crossdresser is a person that is of a gender but likes dressing up as the other gender from time to time.    What the term trap tries to define are anime characters that dress up and act like another gender, and sometimes even go as far as saying they feel like the gender they're going by, but doesn't actually suffer from gender dysphoria. What makes this term not really useable for real people is the fact that you can never assume a person isn't suffering from gender dysphoria because *they* are the only ones able to tell what they're suffering from, as with a fictional character it's entirely alright to assume they aren't suffering from something if the narrative doesn't imply they are.    That being said, people will keep both misusing the term and misinterpreting it, and while I'm against completely banning the term (I mean, did that ever work...?) I won't pretend I have a solution to this.",

I don't think \"not having reviews\" is a fair reason to get mad at a game dev for using a platform that gives them more money.    I paid my dues and installed Steam when it sucked because I needed to so I could play Half Life 2. I've installed Uplay and Origin and rolled my eyes when I needed to then as well.

Instead of encouraging such behaviors, people should encourage them to get  the necessary medical help.    On top of that body positivity should be embracing your natural body type. Whether it be a pear, banana, apple, hourglass or etc. Fashion designers make different styles that cater to different body types. Its ridiculous when people get upset when an outfit doesn't look good on them, when its not for their body type to begin with. Embracing their body type is the best way to figure out what makes them look beautiful. Like wearing a size 4 when they're really a size 14. Not only do they make themselves look bad but it gives them a harder/very uncomfortable time forcing themselves in spanx and corsets. Do yourself a favor and wear clothes that work for you, don't wear it just bc its what so and so wore or its what society wants. Everyone is beautiful or handsome in their own unique ways.

We were talking for a few days, and then out of the blue she asks to trade nudes. Normally I'm only really into girls, or feminine trans girls, but I said ok. We traded a few back and forth for a bit, and it was kinda nice. Which is confusing to me now because I can't normally stand seeing a dick, much less get off to one, but IDK. That's not the point of my post. Basically, I enjoyed it. But now I'm starting to think she's actually into me romantically. She keeps talking about cuddling, and other cutesy stuff, and she's still being pretty sexually provocative. The problem is, if she is into me, the feeling isn't mutual, and I feel weird about doing anything because it's kind of a lie. I like her, but as a friend. I don't really want to have any kind of digital relationship, be it romantic or sexual, but that seems like what she wants. I don't want to just cut her off, but I don't really know what to do. Because tbh, I'd be down to trade nudes occasionally if it didn't feel like there were emotional strings attached. But IDK, maybe I would still feel weird about it.     Ugh",

My last dog wasn't an ESA but he was a trained therapy dog. I say \"trained\" but he was a 3 pound long-hair chihuahua who already loved cuddles so it was mostly I who was trained. He would visit hospitals and nursing homes and even after he's passed we've kept in touch with some of the nursing home folk.    I plan on doing the same for my little guy. He'll be 3 this fall and it might be the right time.    >It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules. We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it and places that allow it. The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.     Agreed.     >Why are they worth less than people who need ESA's?    Agreed as well. Everyone's health concerns deserve to be taken into account and I do not envy the people who have to figure those things out.     But like you said, clearer rules are needed. Not only for people who can't be around animals, but in situations like universities that aren't even the best/healthiest places for people, is it really in the best interest of all (including the animals themselves) to have animals in such tight, possibly unhealthy environments?    What my college did was have animals from a local shelter come for visits every now and then and advertise them heavily.

So at the party, which is, let's say 25% LGBTQIA (bare with me here) but are otherwise friendly like on TV. Then a idea popped on your head.    It's about the 80s song \"It's Raining Men.\"     You asked the people about the song. The usual suspects would tell you it's a iconic anthem in the queer community. If you play it in public, someone's coming out the next day.    You tell them you hate it. You remember hating that song since childhood.    So you had the bright idea to change what they think about it.    You tell them, \"The song is about semen coming out\" to much to their shock and horror. You tell them to look closer to the lyrics. Reinterpret the lyrics to fit story you want them to see. You tell them that the song came at height of the AIDS epidemic and that in some nebulous way, is detrimental to the gay community. I tell them the song is everything negative that happened to them.    Cue the angry stares and every urban dictionary insult thrown your way.    That doesn't matter. What does comes after. Over time, a small minority of them will somehow agree with me. Soon they tell people about it those close to them and them to others.     Soon, it would spread to the internet. I don't need to tell what happens next. Celebrities denounce, radio station remove. The whole rigmarole.     This isn't new. You probably know this.

While I'm sure that there are trans women in \"trap\" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. In that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to \"trick\" men, so it's an accurate description. Finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.",

She was musical, beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent, and she was not my wife.      While my marriage was on the rocks at the time, and my wife wasn't around very much, we were still married.  It was a very dark time for me, but Margo was like a massive light that enveloped me and reminded me of who I was.    I think it's worth mentioning that Margo and I never slept together, however we absolutely developed real, and deep feelings for each other.    Anyway, eventually my wife finds out I've been connecting with Margo, and is (rightfully) furious.  There were a few tear filled nights, and some very hard conversations, but in the end, we decided to work things out.  I unceremoniously, (and with much difficulty and hesitation) ended contact with Margo.  I still feel horrible about how this all happened because she really was an amazing person who didn't deserve any of the drama I brought upon her.    So, my wife and I work things out, and things are better than they've ever been between us.  We re-found the love we had somehow lost, and are stronger because of everything that happened.  That being said, there was still always a part of me that was just.... empty and regretful.  Not because of how things turned out but because of the way they happened.  I was also worried about Margo, because for a long time I was her sounding board, and now, I couldn't help her.    Tonight I randomly decided to google Margo, and there was a video of her singing a brand new song, and parts of it were too specific to not be about what happened between us, but it gave me closure that everything is alright now.    It's late and I'm tired but happy. Even though this is a throwaway account I'm hoping this post just gets buried in the \"New\" pile. This was more for me than anything, because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, and posting it here feels like talking about it.

This equates to 641.4 mm. [...] Assuming this sample is roughly representative of adult female U.S. crania, Oprah's head perimeter is 6.3 SD above the mean of American women.    [*\"Independent confirmation of Oprah's head size\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2018/08/26/independent-confirmation-of-oprahs-head-size/):    >The late Gene Siskel went hat shopping with Oprah and the salesman said Oprah's was the largest head he'd ever seen. Using the late J.P. Rushton's idea of using the formula for calculating the volume of a hemisphere (V = circumfence\\^3 / 118.4) Oprah would have a cranial capacity of 2229\u00a0cm\\^3...    [*\"Brain size & ethnic genetic interests at 70th annual Tony Awards\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2016/06/14/brain-size-ethnic-genetic-interests-at-70th-annual-tony-awards/):    >I spent Sunday evening trying to watch anything other than the news and I stumbled upon the 70th annual Tony Awards. Generally speaking, high IQ people tend to be fans of the arts, so it came as no surprise to see arguably the biggest brained and most successful woman on the planet, multi-billionaire Oprah, dominating the event.    [*\"IQ & fighting back against racism\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2014/11/15/iq-fighting-back-against-racism/):    >Oprah's 2029 cc cranial capacity gave her the IQ to handle racists with style. When a skinhead called her a monkey and then tried to change the subject, Oprah grabbed him by the arm and said '\"I want to talk about the *monkey business*\".

[*\"Big Brained Oprah tried to stop the war with Iraq\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2014/12/15/big-brained-oprah-tried-to-stop-the-war-with-iraq/):    >While no human in history has had a deviation IQ much beyond 200, Oprah's 2,029 cc estimated brain size is arguably around what you would statistically expect from a 400 IQ being, and so was the wisdom she displayed in the run-up to the war in Iraq. [...] It seems marvelously\u00a0symbolic that Oprah, arguably the biggest brained member of America's elite ultimately passed that test with such flying colours, and got on the right side of history.

Martha Stewart began showing Oprah a very efficient way to maneuver a bed sheet, and asked Oprah to grap one corner of the bed sheet. Sensing she didn't have the spatial ability to perform the task competently and not wanting to look foolish in front of millions of TV viewers, Oprah was forced to adapt. Instead of grabbing the corner of the sheet, Oprah spontaneously ran to the audience to grab a Martha Stewart fan.

[...] It seemed to me her huge brain size was giving her an ability to come up with witty comments, and down-home folksy wisdom that kept the audience entertained.

[...] Had her IQ been even higher still (150 instead of 140), she might have made the leap from Presidential king maker to President.    [*\"How Oprah cured my homophobia\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2017/02/16/how-oprah-cured-my-homophobia/):    >...to hear\u00a0the World's most influential woman give\u00a0[a political opinion] that was so succinct, loud, powerful and graphic, and on behalf of an oppressed minority other than her own, just brought the house down.\u00a0In that moment, my homophobia was cured. [...] Rather than trying to defend an awkward argument, Oprah had the cognitive adaptability to shift gears completely, by saying \"I wasn't trying to absurd, sir\" [...] Big brained Oprah then cleverly used her power which he did not have, by cutting to commercial break.    [*\"Big brained black billionaire\"*](https://pumpkinperson.com/2016/08/29/big-brained-black-billionaire/):    >A thousand years from now, when no one even knows who Oprah was, anthropologists might dig through the soil and discover a\u00a0skeleton with a colossal cranial capacity and assume it belonged to someone extremely intelligent.\u00a0 They'll\u00a0think it must have belong to some rare super human, perhaps a more evolved species.\u00a0 They\u00a0might then discover the\u00a0remains\u00a0of her\u00a0massive brick mansion and realize her intelligence allowed her to rule over the other humans of her time.

I imagine they definitely come hand in hand with a lot of incestuous relationships, but like, power imbalances are a thing in *a ton* of non-incestuous relationships as well.  I think it's hard to say that it's a problem that is particular to incest between relatives of similar ages.    > Inbreeding is more harmful as a practice than the individual instances.    I think that's fair, but that seems like more of a pragmatic argument to put prohibitions on it than a moral argument against its practice.  It seems to me like at the end of the day the issue is still that by having sex two relatives increase the risk of health problems in future generations.  This effect is compounded by successive generations of incest in a way that could be *especially* harmful, but idk it seems to me like if you're going to argue that incest on the whole is immoral that need to apply to individual instances and not just multigenerational practices.    > Though on a related note: This movie is hilariously bad.

I have received more or less the same answers you received, although in my case it was always forceful molestation. There is still this underlying thought from men that mostly see the other sex as a chance to be sexual with rather than human beings first, but not when without them, mostly with strangers or friends or acquaintances.

If I'm not mistaken there are websites that people advertise their places to rent out rooms designed specifically for college students  not on campuses just random people advertising I've looked into it before for my country, so pretty much you would be sharing a place with other people but you have your own space ofc with people who r in college as well which could be a good thing to look into not just for the moving out aspect but you also could make some friends idk.     I'm glad to hear she did at least try and can see he went way way over the top. Maybe try talking with her 1 on 1 so maybe since she has experienced similar feelings in the past she would be more understanding of your perspective and how serious it is and that you do need support.     A few comments said that you need to cut ties the toxicity in your life but at the moment that is more or less impossible and would cause too much grief for you and they are a part of your support network and that's something that is important to have (a support network) and maintain. I think your dad is just confused and doesn't know how to handle just mental health on a whole maybe having a heart to hear with your mum could help her help him to learn more about this kinda stuff so he can help you because I'm sure all he wants is to help you but just doesn't know how to, and maybe he is struggling aswell and just doesn't know it properly sand doesn't currently have the mental capacity needed to take proper care of you. There are so many things that could have attributed to his his actions that have nothing to do with you and could be a case of poorly directed and understood emotions, Has he been under any stress or pressure at work?, Unexpected bills, a loss of a loved wrong?, problems at home or job security? , or maybe him seeing you at the age you are taking steps into college has him thinking of the past or whatever and that's gotten him down(like him not being where he'd like to be in life idk I'm not a councillor). Idk sorry you said like everything was lovely before so I'm trying to think about what could be the underling cause for why he reacted in such a horrible way, I'm sure he regrets what he said and feels bad for it. I hope he does. And I hope he will come around soon and acknowledge what he said and apologises to you. Sorry I hope you get what I'm trying to say.    But above all you need to look out for you and trying to protect your mental state is most important so if that means ASAP moving out work towards what you have to do to achieve that so you can at least get that space to become level headed which in turn will help you be able to feel better. And hopefully fix and build a healthy relationship with your dad if you do decide that it is something you want.       It will be hard, you will have feelings to end it all, you will want to give up and it will feel pointless. But I promise you that it won't be worth it. You will struggle your entire life. Everyone does in their own way that's just the sad 'shitty' fact of life. But as life goes on you build experience of dealing with the shit life throws at ya and get better at coping with your thoughts and feelings and someday in the future you will be faced with a problem and then think back and think to yourself \"wow if X was a problem 2 years ago that would have been enough to make me tie the rope there and then. But it's a problem now and I'm okay\". And that's something you will be happy to acknowledge that you have progressed in yourself and all the suffering we go through conditions us to who we are going to be in the future like for example if in the future you become a parent I have no doubt you will be a amazingly supportive and loving parent because you will understand what it's like to feel certain feelings.    Sorry I'm on phone so terrible formatting and what not I truly hope for the best for you OP please take care of yourself and I hope you can see what I'm trying to say please let me know if there is something I said that doesn't make sense or worded wrong.

Given that fact, and the fact there is a photo of Sexton and his (now crucified in public after his death) father at the Daytona 500 in 2007, and given that Nascar enjoys most of it's popularity amongst blue collar workers we can reasonably infer that Sexton's father was working in a factory in a struggling town.

The southern Ming saw themselves as fighting an illegitimate foreign Dynasty to reestablish a dynasty ruled by the ethnically Han people's, in the same vein as Liu Bei trying to reestablish the venerable Han Empire in Shu-Han from Wei usurpers.

This denomination of Christianity is extremely strict. Most of the women only wear skirts below the knee, the children are homeschooled, and they reject modern music and media. The Duggar family had a reality television show called \\*19 Kids and Counting\\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters. A new show, called \\*Counting On\\*, focuses on just the adult children and their lives after the scandal. Both of the TV shows used to have their own subreddits, but they became mostly inactive.         This subreddit drama focuses on r/DuggarsSnark, a subreddit created to make snark about the Duggar family. However, there has been discussion between members on the subreddit concerning what constitutes snark and what constitutes \"leghumping.\" Leghumping is fawning over or praising the Duggars, which is not allowed on the sub. Some people believe positive observations (ex: Her hair looks better than usual) or explaining behavior (ex: Is it normal to eat casserole all the time? Yes, that is normal in some regions) are forms of leghumping, while other people do not believe so.         **Original Post**    [A regular user posted a meme aimed at leghumpers, people in the comments don't like being characterized as leghumpers, there is a fight about what constitutes leghumping](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/atypz2/the_leghumping_pests_infesting_this_sub/eh4f65x)         [The user then decides to leave the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au31u8/im_ready_to_move_on/)         [A different user creates a discussion themed subreddit to supplement the snark subreddit, snark fans tell him to leave](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au3ifq/rduggardiscourse/eh6knwl)         [The two main mods (one now deleted) attempt to clarify \"leghumping\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/au5h9h/message_from_the_mods/eh5rlrg)         [A less active mod makes their own post (now deleted) to clarify \"leghumping,\" using a definition that allows positive comments and explaining to be posted.

He had 3 clogged arteries, 100%, 85% and another 70 ish %. My heart was so fucking crushed when I saw him the ICU, all pale, IVs sticking out every which way, and a giant feeding tube shoved down his throat. That week, was probably the worst week in my entire life.     All in the months of May and June; my childhood dog died at 13, right before her birthday in July.    I had to re-home my lizard because I am moving and she means literally so much to me. I fucking bawled even thinking about her leaving my home. Luckily she went to a good family friend, but it's like parting from my child for me.    I got into a big fight with my old best friend and they said some really cruel and nasty things about me and I honestly don't know when that wound will heal for me.    My therapist from since I was 2 years old, has cancer. It rapidly approached and in just a month she went from active and clear headed, to being at the point where she can no longer take care of herself and needs daily assistance.    During this entire year, I think I've been abusing a substance, using it as a crutch. I want to get help, but I also don't want to necessarily stop altogether.    So basically that was my year (so far). I have to admit, there have been some really wonderful things that have happened, but it's hard to enjoy them. I mean, this year will always be branded into my brain (The most being my father's near death experience).    Thank you for reading and I hope you can have a wonderful rest of 2019",

In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.    The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:    Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.    There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:    The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The \"domestic violence\" acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c    An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:    The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.    More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862    Yet another study \"indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent).\" A.H.

            "input": "Slut has always been an insult for women, not men, and virgin has always been an insult for men, not women. This whole dichotomy exists because of the different ways in which men and women pursue sex.    It is not difficult to attract sexual partners as a woman. The same is not true of men. Attracting partners is actually challenging as a man, so the ability to do so is seen as that - an ability, a talent, a skill. Now, a woman who has high standards will find difficulty attracting a man who fits them, but it is fundamentally not hard for a woman to find sex if that's all she wants, so choosing whether to be a slut or not is always a conscious choice. If she wants sex, she can get it. If she doesn't, she doesn't. Right-wing society says the choice to be a virgin is the superior one, left-wing society disagrees, but it's still a choice.    For men, attracting partners is not a choice, it's a challenge. Thus, calling a man a virgin is not at all like calling a woman a slut. Instead, it's akin to saying \"you've never successfully performed this challenge\", like saying you're unathletic because you can't throw a three-pointer, or unintelligent because you can't pass an exam, to the point that even the few straight men who consciously choose not to pursue the challenge of wooing women tend to be put in the same basket as those who try and fail. This is why the word 'virgin' is an insult to men.",

I had been to this one once before and as soon as I walked in the ward I felt safe again. It was home.    One of the counselors there and I got very close. I'm ashamed to say he was everything I looked for in a person, not even in a sex/love way.As a kid I dreamed about a knight in shining armor, and he was exactly that.    He would talk to me personally every night, staying after his shift ended. I remember one night opening up to him about the abuse after all patients had gone to bed. He stayed so late that night, and I told him \"go home. You have a kid.\" He told me \"I'm not leaving until I know you're safe. Those people are never allowed to visit. We'll report them together. I always knew there was more you weren't telling me, and now everything makes sense. It's okay. You're safe here, and I'm not letting anything else happen to you.\" He said he didn't do all this for anyone.    Locked wards have very strict rules, and I broke them frequently. I slowly got all privileges taken away for multiple incidents. I would sleep in a chair next to the nurses station. I was only allowed to use crayons, since I abused pens.     But this counselor bent the rules and I was allowed to have my guitar. He knew how to play and would hold down the strings for me so I could have a capo. I played for relaxation most nights, and other patients would stay up just to listen.    Before I left, he told me \"the only way I'm ever allowed to hear about you, or see you on the news is if you get famous for music.\" Meaning, he didn't want to hear that I had killed myself.     It's been so long, but sometimes I pray to him. I hope he gets the message and knows somehow I'm still breathing. I want him to know I've kept my promise.    I love him so much it hurts to hear his name, and I will never tell anyone because they think it's a crush. It's more than that. He saved me.    Thank you. If you're out there somewhere.",

They remark that gender is just a social construct, invalidating their own made up identities.  And the only difference with a transgender person is they're constantly pumping their body with hormone replacement and have gone through surgery to look like the other gender. Biologically, they're still the gender they were born as.    Most transgenders have more mental issues than just gender dysphoria, many normally have bipolar and other personality disorders to go along with it. Yet it's \"transphobic\" to point out the natural observation that their mindset isn't a healthy one.      Being an angry little man is not the same thing as doing ideological criticism, lol.

However, I do recognise that I might have driven her away a bit by avoiding to see her back then.    I went to a therapist back when I was 17 to talk about this and some other, darker, things. She ended up saying that she didn't treat troubles as bad as mine, gave me another place's number & charged me anyway. I'll never go to a therapist again, since she was not the first one I went to during my life. I went to one when I was 5, another one when I was 12 and another one when I was 14. Neither one of them were able to help me at all with the issue I faced at the time (I don't quite remember why I went when I was 5 but the other two times were because of anger management issues).     Last year I thought of fixing my anxiety myself with meds since it got really bad (I got to the point of stuttering once when talking to two girls and one guy), but I couldn't find any pharmacy willing to sell them to me without a prescription so I couldn't do anything about it.    I don't know if I like anything about myself. I'm a good friend, I guess? Back when I had friends I always stood by their side and always listened to them when they had some sort of problem.

If you like comics The Watchmen has great symbolism and framing. As does V for Vendetta. The Sandman comics are good, too. I also recommend Ichi the Killer if you are feeling adventurous. It is definitely NSFW/L depending on your views. Ichi is one piece of work I try to get other people to read because I still have some serious unanswered questions about things.

I've known her since sophomore year, and now we're both seniors. I'm graduating in 2.5 months, but she's staying for a 5th year. Most of my friends are juniors or staying for a 5th year, so it's going to be really tough for me to leave my friends behind. My college friends are like my family.    I've also helped C through a nasty breakup with one of her previous girlfriends. Because of this, I was happy for her when she got her new girlfriend last year, but now I think things have gotten weird.    She literally spends all her time with her girlfriend. Like always. Even though C lives with just one other dude, her girlfriend is practically her third roommate, and I know this pisses off C's actual roommate. C's girlfriend doesn't go to college and just lives in the same town we go to school in.    C has just gradually stopped talking to me. She even killed our ~600 day snapchat streak a few months ago for practically no reason. Sometimes she'll randomly send me a meme or two on Facebook and I'll try to start a conversation with her, but 95% of the time the conversation ends with her leaving me on read.    Sometimes, I'll see C's other friends around on campus and they'll ask me if I've ever heard from C, because they haven't. Because of this I know this isn't something C's just doing to me, but she's doing this to all her friends.    I'm happy that C is happy in her relationship, but I'm hurt that she's practically cut off myself and all of her other friends. Since I'm graduating in a few months, I want to spend as much time with all of my friends as possible before I leave campus. I haven't seen her in months, and I'm worried that if she doesn't get her shit together, I may not see her again before I graduate    **Thanks for reading.

But literacy tests applied without racial discrimination have always [been upheld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassiter_v._Northampton_County_Board_of_Elections).    It was a law, specifically the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that banned literacy tests, not some Supreme Court ruling. And really, that national ban is probably on shakier constitutional grounds than any neutrally applied literacy test.

Just shut up and listen. It's not that simple. It's never that simple.     Dating the sick girl means committing to non-commitment. Plans will be ruined, or more likely cancelled. Travel is rare or just completely out of the question. Dating the sick girl means put a ton of blood, sweat and tears into someone who might not even have a future. It means a lot of days sitting alone on the couch while she naps in the bedroom. It means being taken care of, even though it feels silly, because she understands how fragile the human body can be and she doesn't want to lose you. Because you mean everything to her.    And she's not a passing fancy, or a charity case. She doesn't want your pity. She is not interested in a fleeting romance. So much of her life is fleeting, over before it starts. She's only interested in a solid lasting connection, it's something that is so very precious to her because the concrete often feels so out of reach for someone who lives with what she does.      It's hard. It's not easy. It's not always fun.     And I know what you're thinking:    No relationship is perfect.  All relationships have problems.    Shut the fuck up because those problems are pretty fucking small in comparison to what comes with dating a sick girl. You don't get it unless you've lived through it. But even then you don't fucking get it because you're not her. You don't feel what she feels. You don't see all of her pain because she hides it from you, because she cares about you and wants to protect YOU.    And you can't protect her, and it's devastating. You can't protect her, and it makes you feel weak and useless. It starts to eat at you deep down, and it festers there until you can't take it anymore and then you do what seemed unimaginable.    You leave her.     And her heart breaks as it has every time before. She feels abandoned, alone and lost. She lost her rock. And it kills her inside, because she gets why you left, but she is also so angry because you don't fucking get it.     All she needed was for you to be her rock.  Solid.  Concrete.    And now she's left again with no one to lean on.    Because no one wants to date the sick girl.    Edit: I'm honestly not interested in any unsolicited \"advice\".

I guess the long and short of it is, I can fully see and agree with how it would be offensive in just a normal setting, but I'm not sure if it would be offensive if it's being used mainly for NSFW purposes, which is what it is as far as I know.",

My dad is an engineer, and as a little kid I always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. I excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when I moved into a bit more average.    I then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. I quickly realized how much I hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a D in both Calculus 3 (Taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry II, got into academic probation. I then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my GPA up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing Statics with a F. I honestly feel very annoyed.    I'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking Engineering isn't right for me. I literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. I hate going back to school, rather irritated each time I have to go back. I hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. I hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. The thing I hate most? Tests. Why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? I don't know which other major I can be interested at.    Most people I'm around with are rather shitty, or I just don't fit in with them. I am losing multiple friends back in home, and I'm not making any true friends in college. I'm always open to hanging out, but it's always like this: \"I'm busy, sorry.\" Or some version of that. Or they just don't respond at all. I always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. I also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that I bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least I have a freaking car to use, right?    Why do I have to be that kid who peaked in high school? Back then when I had a girlfriend, was a sports team captain, always have fun stuff to do. Now I'm just sitting here with a low GPA and have not exercised in so long because of engineering work.    I'm fucking irritated. I've been noticing I got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all I want to do is to yell \"FUCK ENGINEERING\" in my brain. Why can't I just get my shit together? I hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but I loathe almost every single math and science courses I take. I loathe calculus and linear analysis. I loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did I let GPA dictate my happiness? And otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 GPA minimum required? It's a very stupid requirement to have, just seeing all those people who cheated their way being eligible for that job.    Feel free to ask me any more questions.",

Nazis beware, and supporters of Nazis and the Hyperboreans and the One must also beware. Do not take me lightly, I have seen things you wouldn't believe.     #**\u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4  (INTRODUCTION TO THE BLESSING)**    The events of the recent past has forced me to make this post to get the words out so that you will know what I stand for and will realize.

Preferably once you begin reading, you keep going the whole time, please try to get through it in one continuous sitting. This is a request, and it is Law.

The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.       #**\u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5 (THE HYPERBOREANS COME AND BRING THEIR SHIT)**    Now we will be talking about the Hyperboreans, are the One's precious pet project to spite the Demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the One. The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen. But they didn't know that did they? They used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of Nazis, literal Nazis, the Nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course.    #**\u05dc\u05d6\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05d9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd (FUCK THE HYPERBOREANS)**    The Hyperborean Empire of theirs, their little Astro-Reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the Demiurge is victorious. They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.    #**\u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (THE HYPERBOREAN REMNANT)**    Oh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the Hyperborean Empire! They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.    #**\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)**    Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning.    #**\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)**    The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right?    #**\u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4\u05d9 (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)**    Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late.    #**\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05e0\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2 (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)**    I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right?    #**\u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)**    This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge.     #**\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)**    This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now.

He had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. It was broken. It was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. IT WAS BROKEN. IT WAS FUCKING BROKEN. His doctor stole him a new one (A DOCTOR HAD TO STEAL A MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICE IN ORDER TO TEND TO HIS PATIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT LONG AND HARD), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. And anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him.    He worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. Don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. HE CONTRIBUTED. HE CONTRIBUTED YOU FUCKING FUCK. You're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? If you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. It doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. THE FUCKING DEATH PANELS ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOUR CADILLAC PLAN WILL DENY YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED SOME DAY FOR SOME BULLSHIT REASON AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE YOU SELFISH SHORT-SIGHTED JACKASS, YOU WILL FUCKING DIE. I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish.    My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick \"support the troops\" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're \"okay\" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back.    I hate these people who act \"woke\" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as \"racist?\" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE.    I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \\*gasp\\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience.    But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge?    I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us.    There is no hope. There is no one coming to the rescue. Everything and everyone will die and rot.",

Based on my own personal experience and other posts I've seen, I would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the OP for venting views they do not like. I get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and I'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. I've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. However, far too often do I notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. Not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. I suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. Attack the argument, not the person.    Basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like \"you're not really X\" or \"you're fake and a troll\". That's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. It's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. It's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. For example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. Is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? If they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. It's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub.    Given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that OffMyChest wouldn't allow, I would expect better of people here. I dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that OffMyChest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views.    So, disagree with me on this if you must, but I think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim I'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything I've written.",

They didn't really hate on the Sequels so much; they found things to criticize because it's their job, but what they don't like is how Disney is essentially milking the property for all it's worth. They actually mentioned in one video that -- as much as they don't like how Lucas made the movies -- at least Lucas was judicious about making them.     Likewise for Star Trek. They don't like how Star Trek has had to contort itself into the \"Action\" part of the sci-fi genre to try to remain commercially relevant when the earlier television shows could go multiple episodes in a row without a single action scene.    That said, I can't say they're not hypocritical, either. They definitely can be, but also, they let you know constantly that this is all their opinion and you shouldn't take it for more than a subjective take on the current state of the IPs.    If anything, watching their Best of the Worst series has made me much more comfortable enjoying the movies I do, because it highlights the importance of entertainment over everything else.

I now know he doesn't care about me, but his still MY best friend. We used to talk everyday, now if he doesn't see me during school hours, he doesn't even send me a message. If I don't look up for him or talk to him, he just ignores me. I have come to think he grew tired of being my friend, as everyone I know. This always happens to me. Nevertheless, I still want his friendship and his approval, even when he has done me so many bad things. Some days it looks as if I'm really his best friend, but other days, he completely ignores my existence. It's just too much. I feel too much, and I always overthink too much.

But yeah it's *super* racist in the South. Basically just like the civil war. You know, the civil war in the 1860s when I was considered property *owned* by someone, couldn't vote, looking at a white woman would've been grounds for the general community to kill me to say nothing of sleeping with one on a regular basis, owning property would've been *hilariously* challenging, and for me to be in possession of a firearm would've been (again) grounds to probably kill me. Pretty sure *knowing how to read* was illegal for black people for awhile, and voting? Haha... no. I think I was still 3/5ths of a person back then.    These people piss me off because they're denigrating the actual racism my grandparents actually lived through. The Klan walked the streets while sweeping Democratic gun laws stopped my grandparents from owning firearms to protect themselves and their children (my father) and they got poll taxes and literacy tests at the polls removed *in their lifetime*- to say nothing of desegregation.    Like what the fuck? Where do these people live that they think anywhere South of the Mason-Dixon is somehow some backwater redneck hick town? Atlanta is in the South- the headquarters of their beloved CNN. So is Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Miami, Knoxville, Charleston, Savannah and a dozen other major metro areas.    The worst part of it all is that these people remind me more of slaveowners than 'progressives'- every slave master thought they were doing black people a favor: we were godless heathens so they put us to work, gave us a place to sleep and food to eat, and \"civilized the negro\". Hey guys, guess what? If I was being subjected to anything resembling systemic civil war-era racism in the South, I'd pick my black ass up and get the fuck out.

I got away from her finally, and for my graduation project i decided to do something based around child abuse      Because of that emotional abuse that i went through, i thought less of my self and had a thin skin, always crying.

Message me at any time, ask me questions, vent or rant to me. Because, no, I may not have gone through the exact same thing, but I went through something close.    I hope you consider talking to me.

            "input": "There's multiple layers to it but in the context of the culture war, people are still sour over Ghostbusters and more so The Last Jedi and how Disney seems to be handling their franchises. They see Captain Marvel (CM) as being shoehorned into the MCU, and recent leaks, if they are to be believed, suggest that the Russo Brothers have clashed with Disney over CM's role in End Game. The Marvel comics are also recovering from some \"forced diveristy\" issues that has [completely tanked their sales](https://youtu.be/9CnTDE2zZU0) (e.g., female Thor). In short, people are tired of mega corporations pandering to diversity progressiveness at the detriment of quality products.    More specifically, Brie Larson has made several comments about white movie critics and how she is going out of her way to give people of colour press access. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this isn't so bad, but her comments have caused a ruckus mostly because she comes off as [snooty and posh](https://youtu.be/ZA_DNrV6izw). Even feminists have accused her of being a limousine liberal and acting like a white saviour which [she has been accused of before](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/brie-larson-basmati-blues-white-saviour-role-attack-criticism-actress-india-cinema-a8057001.html). Gotta pay those bills though, I guess.    The trailers drop for CM and people are unimpressed. This causes media outlets to pump out their preemptive \"incels are back to ruin CM\" narrative. This attracts negative attention and people go to Rotten Tomatoes to say they aren't interested in the movie. This intensified the tension and more articles were written which attracted trolls and genuine pissed off comic and movie patrons alike. The shit snowball keeps rolling and keeps getting bigger.    The movie comes out and reviews are mixed, even from people one might consider \"woke\". Rotten Tomatoes deletes reviews which intensifies tensions further. People fed up with the  \"SJWing\" of preexisting intellectual properties smell blood in the water and keep clashing with people whining about Trump's America being plagued by white nationalist, sexist, GamerGater incels. The fact that the film has moments that would even make the recent Gillette commercial blush isn't helping lol",

Some days I would actually sit on the riding mower and think about how lucky I was.    Then my wife suffered an aneurysm.  I spent 10 days shuttling between the hospital with my wife and the home with our kids.  Whatever she wanted I brought to her.  Whatever the kids needed, they got.  The balls stayed in the air.    In the months following her release,  I took care of her like a nanny.  Whatever she wanted she got.  She wanted a new car.  We got her the top of the line package.  She wanted a new TV.  She wanted a new laptop.  She wanted new clothes and a new kitchen.  Done and done and done and done and done.    She entered peri-menopause.  Everything that she could not control became Enemy.  She became paranoid.  She obsessed over the minutes between my end of work and when I got home.  She obsessed over my daily mileage.  An extra tenth of a mile or an extra minute meant that I was fucking the neighbor.  She claimed that I tricked her into buying the new car and the new kitchen when she was weak.  We did not have sex for the final three years of cohabitation.     The kids began to suffer.  She became increasingly volatile and violent.  Many times I came home to a broken interior door or a hole in a wall.  If I was home I had to be ready to get between my wife and my children at the drop of a hat.  He rmother pleaded with her to get professional help.  Our pastor pleaded with her to seek professional help.  I agreed to see a therapist with her and, after our third session, the therapist told her that she should seek help from a PhD level neuropsychologist.      Eventually the kids moved out of the house.  She demanded that I remove them from my will.  She demanded that I stop supporting them in any way.  I was to stop their annual gifts.  i was to stop paying for their health insurance.  She threatened to call my HR department, pretending to be me, and remove them from my benefits.  She stole tens of thousands of dollars from their accounts and was charged with multiple felonies.  My children asked the prosecutor to go lightly on their mother and the charges were dropped after she returned their money.    Eventually she filed for a TRO because she claimed that I was stalking her.  I moved out and filed for divorce.    I have offered to give her everything.  The house that is nearly paid off and easily sold or refinanced.  The cars that are paid off.  Every single piece of movable property.  All I want in return is my retirement.  I just want to be shut of her.  She refuses to respond to my offer.    She has filed for disablilty benefits so that she can receive spousal support.  She has filed for multiple TROs, all denied.  Denied but costly to the defendant.  If one stuck I would probably lose my job.    She is hell-bent on bankrupting me even though it bankrupts her, too.

I got suspended for seven days for \"Harassment\".    Today on the **sixth day** it was finally reversed via appeal. My appeal was simple. There is no harassment if someone messages **YOU** and never ONCE indicates in the messages that they wish to stop receiving messages. That very clearly means they WANT to keep talking to you.    Not once did [highest karma user] *ever* indicate he didn't want to receive further messages from me! In fact, the last PM I had sent him was to never contact me again, which he somewhat complied with, well, until he had his cronies (the Reddit admins) falsely suspend me.    Posting private messages (of which he was going to do anyway, evident by how he used it to rally brigades against me and many others) is a bit crass but **not** against the rules whatsoever.    tl;dr: Do **NOT** talk to power users or anyone who may have an agenda against you. Reddit admins don't actually look at harassment reports---they just take them at face value and assume the report is true. An appeal will likely be listened to at some point if you're not being a tool within it and **have clear and concise proof that they not only initiated conversation but never said \"stop talking to me\" or anything to that effect**, but it'll be near the end of the suspension anyway.",

However, I thought this scene had narm instead. Its meant to be dramatic and sad and yet it just felt kind of awkward.",

We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).     So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just \"get closer\" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used.     Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.     I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.     P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough.    TL;DR:  My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me. I feel so used and disgusted with myself and I dont know why she did it.",

Functionality wise it's pretty cool though, like Reddit but more like a blog site, so you can have pictures and video in your post (think instead of image and self post it's the two combined kind of like a html document).    It's run on a cryptocurrency where the upvotes and karma actually add up to a payout. Naturally it is now 99% bot abuse and karma farming and the shittest shitposts you've ever seen, 1% actual users posting legitimately cool art stuff and of course circlejerking over this week's popular shitcoin.    The big draw of it, that is both also a huge disadvantage, is that no one can physically delete anything. It can be downvoted (\"flagged\") into oblivion and the frontend can be set up to expunge stuff below a score though, and there is no one there to intervene when someone does that. So that makes for a kind of shit culture where people are scared to upset the power users who can drop a -10 dollar flag on your post, or make a bot that auto flags everything. The idea of it is though that it's a monetisation model where the act of voting does a blockchain thing that makes more of that coin, and you get money from it (and the voter gets some as well called curation). In theory yeah that's great, in practice you need literally millions of upvotes from small steem power accounts to amount to anything, and there is nothing stopping some bully from running an account that does nothing but auto flag all submissions by someone.    But as far as hosting something up there goes it works super well at least lol. And if it were actually populated with a broad userbase it would counteract the problems I mentioned above.
