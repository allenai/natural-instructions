            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich√©) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",

            "input": "Stick with the original . When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?    I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.    But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.    Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?    I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.    by Tom Knapp, Rambles edito",

We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be.    Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.    I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention.     The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.    Cute movie, with a good heart.

If you are looking for a brief overview of wedding planning, then this would be a very well-done general reference guide. It will give you an overview of wedding day idea's and will be most helpful.     You get a little bit of flowers, dresses, cakes, atmosphere, etc. so this is an informative, but basic, tool to help you in your plans. The quality of film, sound, and color is superb, as always. She gives her lessons slow enough to take notes, but still with enough information that you feel you have a good hold of the subject.

I had read both this novel and a predecessor, 'A Certain Justice,' and came across this film as it was presented over a two-night episode of PBS 'Mystery!.'  I am, as it bears mentioning, completely unfamiliar with the work of Roy Marsden in this role, and so approach this presentation with relatively fresh eyes. (Although, I doubt I would have enjoyed his performance having been completely captivated by 'The Sandbaggers.')  Shaw's presentation of Dalgliesh is understated, and most definitely contemplative.  Those looking for melodrama will be deeply disappointed.  The film retains all the essential elements of the novel, and most of the subtext usually lost in novel to film translations is pleasantly preserved in this rendition.  Certain motivations of the secondary characters are truncated, but this is a necessary convention of the form, and is not done capriciously or in disservice to the overall narrative.  My only complaint is the presentation of the actual physical church building.  Given its importance in the overall story, more effort could have been made to create a more imposing, reverant, and solemn atmosphere of this crucial location.  As this is but a minor quibble, I hardily recommend this production, and give it four stars",

If you are looking for and need special features and clips that are as slick as any music video being produced in 2007, then I'm sorry to say you will be disappointed with The Mothership Connection Live From Houston.    For everyone else, what the DVD chronicles is P Funk the way it sounded and was performed each night in the mid-1970s; you just never knew who may show up to make the concert just a bit more funkier. By the end of the show, the opening act - Sly and The Family Stone - along with Bootsy Collins and members of his Rubber Band are in on the funkified jam.    Recorded in 1976, it was at a time when concerts weren't being chronicled on a nightly basis for possible future use. I would wager that a member of the stage crew decided to capture the gig on tape and it was gathering dust in a vault somewhere before the audio was enhanced about as well as it could have been for release.     What makes this a special gem is the \"rough\" nature of the video. The band and guest performers were not on stage knowingly making a movie; this is a tour date with all the power, energy & surprises that George Clinton delivered each night to the audience.

Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash...    Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.     First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it.    MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!     I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off.  What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film.    If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book.    Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one",

Ash is at his weakest in this version of the series, but this is how he gets started. The cast is much different than that of Evil Dead 2, and by far, this film is MUCH gorier, as preferred.

            "input": "Walt Disney Would Never Have Put His Name on This. . \"The Wild\" is under the \"Walt Disney Pictures\" banner, and even rated G, so I expected it to be a picture for the whole family, of which the studio is proud. I hoped it would put me in the Disney mood prior to our family trip to Walt Disney World.    Disappointed am I. It's mediocre and has just about nothing in common with the Walt Disney legacy. To be sure, it is not unusually offensive (the way the usually superb Ron Howard offended me with his witless and crude destruction of \"Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas\"). It is just irritating and amateurish in its writing and direction. For those of you who know something about animation, has no one informed the director \"Spaz\" (his self-chosen moniker) or any of the animators the concept of the \"hold\"? A \"hold\" in animation is when the movement stops for a moment to emphasize an expression or an attitude or a gesture. It is priceless when used well (and gives the animator a few frames worth of a break, besides). Perhaps the all time masters of the hold in animation are Chuck Jones (think of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner), Tex Avery, and Bob Clampett during the golden age of Warner Brothers cartoons.    \"The Wild\" has a total of zero holds. Everyone and everything is moving twenty-four times every second from movie's beginning to end. Who can watch that? My eyes just couldn't take it. The attitudes and gestures were all there. They were just there ten times more often than any human mind could process.    But that could be forgiven if the story was clever, conveyed a meaningful theme and was told with clarity, drama, and humor.    Instead of clarity, every sentence of dialogue was written to sound ironic or sarcastic or \"funny\" or \"witty,\" never actually achieving real humor or wit. It's hard to know what any character really wants if they never express themselves clearly and simply. (I suppose once in a while they did, but that was the exception.) There is no attempt to make the squirrel's romantic crush remotely believable, and the father-son theme is trite as can be. Finally, there is so much slapstick violence (characters get hurt a lot) that I almost question the G rating. It's a valid rating but the film is definitely too full of scares (like the far superior \"The Incredibles\") for anyone under age 7. (This is not new in the Disney tradition, as \"Snow White\", \"Bambi\", \"Sleeping Beauty\" and maybe \"Peter Pan\" are also too intense for the very young).    There is no less artistry required to make a kid's comedy animation than any adult movie. In fact, more awareness of one's all-ages audience is required to make it entertaining and meaningful rather than irritating, boring or traumatizing. The theme of \"The Wild\", trite as it is, has potential value but it's ineffectively communicated.    I think \"Spaz\" and his crew believed they had a film so full of roll-on-the-floor belly-laughs it would excuse the flimsiness of the story. Unfortunately they were mistaken. This was not a Pixar movie if you didn't figure that out yet. The good news is, Pixar is back in business with Disney and we can look forward to their consistently superior material, which has already started with \"Cars\"",

Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie, the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new. I went to high school with kids like this and I've bought the Eminem CD. And there's a little more to them than the stupidity. But let's discuss the movie.    Anne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. (??). Seeing her boyfriend beat down, she's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating. Then she goes to parties, gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer-inspired ghetto talk. The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner, but well he's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner. Actually, he's coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat. Yes, it's ironic that she's trying to dress ghetto while he's trying (not very hard) to dress suburban (wife beater is suburban?)    The movie's climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their \"crew\" and if the gang didn't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked, they sure have it then (and really, who doesn't know that that's gang initiation standard - started by the Hell's Angels in 1965). After that disaster (both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid. There's a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people, but it's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie.    The one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls' character from Hustle & Flow (and Hustle & Flow in and of itself) since that's a white character in a black world that doesn't fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser. He's just himself whereever he goes. He's someone the morons of this movie could learn from (but really wouldn't you rather just see them all shot dead?",

            "input": "deep focus . I've taught this film in colleges for thirty-plus years.  Even back at the earliest screenings, traditional-aged freshmen had trouble with it (a) because it was in b&w, and (b) because the dimensional characters didn't telegraph plot advancement but instead used irony, wit, or assumptions that would later be proven wrong by subsequent events.    The first of these objections stunned me when they couldn't appreciate Gene Tierney descending the stairs to seduce \"Larry\" in a gown relegated to grays.  The second objection (young auduence confusion) just made me sad about the impact of television ... but you already know that story.  As with Hollywood's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, released in during the same general period, I personally appreciate the \"epic scope\" of the narrative, enhanced by remarkable set direction detail.  And I appreciate even more the depth-of-focus photography in both of these films, which enriches viewing by sharp images at several planes of action within the frame.  It's a story well-told at the visual level.  I've read complaints about Tyrone Power's \"dated\" acting in this performance, NIGHTMARE ALLEY, etc.  But again, I suspect this is from a generation more comfortable with MTV editing than with theatre as an entertainment criterion.  Power is given a series of difficult monologues to recite about uncinematic spiritual/ philosophical themes, and he pulls each off brilliantly.  As with Olivier's opening scene in RICHARD III, it's interesting to watch how these monologues have been directed to use a pacing movement of the actor within the frame as a \"paragraphing\" punctuation.  The lengthy, uninterrupted takes and consequent fluidity of camera movement within these shots not only enhances the impact of the monologues but also makes sly commentary on characters/ themes as continuous camera includes other characters in medium close-ups.  Herbert Marshall's Maugham is interesting and underplayed almost as masterfully as Cedrick Hardwicke's performance of \"goodness personified\" in ROPE.  The close-ups of \"Maugham's\" eyes to communicate ironic plot points may seem obtrusive, but they're true to Maugham's voice in the novel.    Further, they emphasize the ill-advised decision to omit this narrator's perspective in Murray's hapless remake.  That later film fails in no small part because the female characters are virtually indistinguishable visually, and because the studio (which only made the film to entice Murray to make GHOSTBUSTERS II) invested no interest in producing a good movie script.  Pity, since Murray could have done okay.  Two less successful scenes in the 40s version are the \"Baby!\" hospital melodrama and the ashram Jehovah sequences (not including the remarkably visual spiritual moment in the mountains).  But the supporting cast remains superb throughout--especially the bracing comedy of Webb and Lancaster, and the moving subtlety of John Payne and Lucille Watson.    Tierney's richest moments are linked to the plot:  \"That's all right, Larry.  It might be less than a year\"; the wedding announcement over the phone; the camera-narrated scene where Isabel \"seduces\" Larry's fiancee; and, of course, the climax with Larry at the end.  And, by the way, she's as gorgeous as Tyrone Power!    How much more value can one expect from an entertainment that succeeds so well with complex, mature themes of spiritual redemption in a society of capitalist myopia?",

After reading Queen Bees & Wannabees, I can't help but despair whenever I look over the precipice and get a glimpse into teen girl world.      In Barbie's envisioning of this world the central theme is to \"be yourself\", but in the end they only seek themselves in a banal existence of dress shopping, chasing each others' boyfriends, inventing lip gloss disguised as a highlighter, deciding what to wear to an afternoon of watching cute boys practice football, and halfheartedly pursuing a career as a rock star.  While I realize that this is teenage girl reality, is this what needs to be held up to pre-teens as a personality blueprint?    The popular girls look exactly like the unpopular girls, so it's not like the criteria for who gets to set foot on the \"popular lawn\" is really clear, other than you have to be mean-spirited and backstabbing.  But at least they somewhat captured the spirit of what it's like to be on the outside looking in.    Of course, there's the \"magic diary\" aspect of the story, which seemed the only tie to the \"other\" Barbie world (Fairytopia, Mermadia, et all).  I realized then what I was really watching...a marketing cry for help from Mattel.  The target demo for Barbie has shrunk to 3-6 year old girls, and they're trying desperately to expand back into the 7-11 range that other brands like Bratz are chipping away at.  I promptly dumped all Mattel stock from my 401k.",

Besides classics, such as \"Psycho\", \"The Haunting (original)\", \"Rosemary's Baby\", \"The Exorcist\", \"The Omen (original)\", \"The Shining\", \"The Changeling\", \"Halloween\", \"Alien\" and \"The Evil Dead\". I also enjoy more recent flicks, such as \"The 6th Sense\", \"The Others\", \"The Ring (US version)\", \"The Grudge (US version)\" \"The Descent\", \"Dawn Of The Dead (Remake)\" and \"TCM 2003 Remake\".  The Problem with \"The Beginning\" is, that   A. the viewer knows that nobody will survive this massacre the second the movie starts. Which leads to the fact that no hero can be found in this movie!  B. Nobody gets to know why Leatherface turned out this way. Damn, they could've atleast shown some flashbacks or a decent intro as e.g.in \"House Of Wax\".  C. There is waaaay too much unnecessary gore and therefore lack of true suspense.  These facts, especially the last, make this movie a over the top gorefest in the same league as \"Wolf Creek\", \"High Tension\", \"Hostel\" and \"Saw (Sequels)\". As one re-viewer stated. Horror movies should entertain by giving the viewer bonechilling suspense and a few good scares. This movie sadly couldn't succeed, due to unnecessary gore, splatter and blood. I don't need that",

He sees the events unfold through the window of his apartment, just as we see them on the movie screen.

The film is smartly complemented by the excellent director's work, superb acting, top cinematography, and the beautiful scenery of (Laplandia - Korelia) the northern Russia - southern Finland.  This was the territory the Soviets aggressively took away from the Finns in 1939 in the Soviet - Finish war (the forgotten war).

This delightful Italian comedy, shows how Rosalba, an Italian hosewife, taken for granted by her family, who has lived her whole life in Pescara, Italy ... takes a vacation from them all to visit Venice, Italy. There she begins a new life with a zany group of characters who become her friends. She finds pleasure in simple everday life activities. She takes joy in spontaneously responding to the new experiences this vacation has opened for her. She meets a waiter, who provides her with a room to stay in when her funds are low. She gets a job in a florist's shop, where the owner is an eccentric old gentleman who has the habit of discussing anarchy. She rekindles her musical talent after discovering an accordion ... Rosalba is accepted for who she is by her new cohorts. In this environment, Rosalba compares her old constrained stifling life with her recently discovered freedom. The question is, will Rosalba give up her freedom, now that she has experienced independence?

After fishing out the ring with a bit of difficulty, she steps out only to discover the tour bus driving off - without her. She telephones her husband Mimmo who berates her for getting lost.

A shady character offers him a hotel room which ends being a rinky dinky old houseboat ... To find Rosalba, he posts flyers with her photo in many strategic locations around Venice. After seeing one, Rosalba phones and meets with him but manages to escape ... Constantino follows her stealthfully to her apartment. Grazia, the masseuse, mistakes him for a client and he lies to gain access into the building. Grazia falls in love with him and Constantino reciprocates the feelings. There are immensely funny episodes and comedic events which play out as this couple works out their relationship. Rosalba does eventually return home to her family, filled with nostalgic memories about her independent vacation.

This one is for music lovers.  Many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio, with John Simon, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix.  Absolutely fascinating stuff.  Having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past 30 years, it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated, with insightful commentary from the artists who created it.    Also fascinating, in more of a train wreck kind of a way, was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.  Both brilliant artists, but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of The Band's fame.  Rick's remarks on the loss of his best friend Richard Manuel left me with chills, knowing that not too many more months from this interview and Rick would be gone from this place as well.

Unfortunatley, the beginning is very rough, both in content and speed of the show.     The plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories. He is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head. He meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers, and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy.    Unfortunately, the show is not as slick as the plot sounds. The first episode immediately starts off with the story-telling. It is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous. Throughout the episode, you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises. The problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who's who.     The second episode I found more enjoyable since it was unique. It is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman. The willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children. It even has a little plot twist, nothing extrodinary but still welcoming.    And once again, the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders. This is when the show became boring for me. I do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about, but I like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about. Also, the show's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the DVD.    I give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great. Unfortunately, the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show weren't the main focus of these first few episodes. Maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot, but I personally don't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk.

After hearing all of the commentary on the importance of the Pixies to modern music, seeing the powerful (yet physically still) nature of their live performance, and seeing some of the music videos for the first time, I was convinced that Doolittle was worth a genuine try.    Yes, the Brits in \"Gouge\" do some kissing-up, but you can tell (they're not actors, after all), that it is truly sincere.  Bowie and Bono, while neither one is half the artist of B.F., do seem especially informed and heart-felt in their analysis and praise.  How humbling it must be to have so many renowned artists and journalists praise your work !  This is a good primer for further study of the band - it was for me.    I'm in a cover band (as David Bowie says in the DVD - everyone who's heard Pixies, forms a band), since I feel a strong urge to try to cover Pixies' music.  The other members didn't know of their work, so I am going to use this DVD as a seminar on the Pixies' work.  I watch it regularly, for personal inspiration - I can't get enough.  Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) says that you must be \"that good for a start\" - we are going to give it a shot.      I was in high school when the more favored 3 CDs were published, but alas, was never exposed.  A year and a half later, I am so glad that I saw, and now own this DVD - most importantly I \"discovered\" the greatness of Pixies.  I even went to see them at a small local venue in June 2005 (got Kim's autograph!).  I will be buying the \"Sellout\" DVD, when released in Oct2005.  I feel that this is a very satisfying DVD, and a DEAL ( no pun intended) for the price of &lt; $20 - a quarter what I paid for my wife and I to see them live.

Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.      As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a \"star\" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of \"cool\" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.      The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.

I had forgotten just how many great songs Irving Berlin wrote for this masterpiece! --\"You Can't Get A Man With A Gun\", \"The Girl That I Marry\",  \"Doin' What Comes Naturally,\" \"Anything You Can Do I can do better,\" \"They Say falling in love is Wonderful,\" \"I Got the Sun in the Morning and the Moon at Night,\" and the classic anthem \"There's No Business Like Show Business.\"If you haven't seen or heard this musical, please do yourself a favor and get this film on tape or DVD.    Afterthoughts:  I just read several negative reviews about Betty Hutton's portrayal of Annie Oakley.  DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.  DO NOT EVEN READ THEM!  Some people are \"the glass is half empty\" type of people and negativity is contagious!  Betty Hutton's portrayal was, of course,  probably directed by the director of the film.    So it is \"the director's portrayal\"; the director is responsible for what Betty Hutton did on screen.  And, this is not meant to be a \"realistic\" portrayal of a \"real\" person anyway---no one alive remembers what Annie Oakley was really like.  So the portrayal by Betty Hutton (as directed by her director) is as good a \"shot at it\" as any other---including Judy Garland's portrayal.  So,  I suggest you just accept Betty Huttons portrayal as \"one among many possible\" and enjoy what the portrayal does have---alot of comedic verve and vivacity!  Yes, \"the glass is half full\"..and even more than half.... in this case.      And then there are some reviewers who criticize the show because Annie pretends to be a poorer shot than Frank  near the end to \"get her man\" by letting him win and thus showing  his \"shooting prowess\" some respect to make him feel better. I suppose for some people it is \"politically incorrect\" to \"play the male ego game\".  But, isn't \"playing the male ego game\"  what it takes sometimes to \"get the man you want?\"  So, wasn't Annie in the play just being \"realistic\"?  Isn't criticizing this aspect of the play \"nit-picking\".  Ask yourself, could you even come close to writing  a   \"masterpiece\"  like the musical, \"Annie Get Your Gun\"?  If you couldn't do it, then what gives you the right to  \"nit pic\" the show?    And the Indian issue.   Some people feel Indians were disrespected in the show.  But, the show I saw has Chief Sitting Bull portrayed as giving good advice to Annie and being an intelligent person. In my opinion,  whichever way the Indians were portrayed in the movie doesn't change anything about all the positive aspects of the show.     My suggestion is to forget about all the nit-picking and ENJOY THE SHOW!  And there's alot to enjoy!  :o)   Email  Boland7214@aol.c",

I saw Fight Club in the theaters in '99, not knowing anything about Chuck Palahniuk at the time and figuring at best it would just be a decent action movie.  What I saw absolutely blew me away as a film that makes one *question* life, consumerism and where we're going as a society.  It was far better than any standard action/thriller could have been; so often it triggered in me brief moments of introspection (\"how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight\", \"if you died right now how would you feel about your life?\", the whole Raymond K. Hessel scene); intellectual script-writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others, and to top it all off probably the most innovative (albeit difficult to believe) surprise ending in film history cement Fight Club as a cult classic with a multi-layered, complex message that would make it perfect for a University student review essay.    Today, 7 years and several Palahniuk books, Fight Club tee shirts and posters later; after making my Internet banking, credit card, phone, online gaming and ISP logins \"Tyler Durden\"; after police found a bunch of high schoolers in another county in my state imitating the movie in a local barn when they were busted after coming home to their parents with bloody noses; after several people have read my email addy and quoted the movie or shot back a quick \"Heyyy.... A FIGHT CLUB FAN!\"- the movie remains needless to say, my all-time favorite.  There is very little grey area with people who've seen it (look no further than the rated reviews here)- most either like it or hate it.  If you're a more intellectual \"thinker\" and a little graphic violence and foul language doesn't easily offend you, give it a viewing (or read the novel if you're more bookworm than movie buff).    The sign of a good song is that its melody and lyrics stay in your head long after you've finished listening to it.  The sign of a good *movie* is not only that its scenes and classic one-liners from an extremely intelligently-written script replay in your mind because they're just THAT memorable, but that its message is so timely, relevant and resonant to modern life with many people that it's still talked about today.  There are message boards on the Net still discussing and debating new talking points about the movie TODAY, 7 years later; there aren't too many other films that have sparked this kind of intelligent, thoughtful and self-exploratory discussion that to this day is still ongoing.  Some of the more misogynistic scenes (\"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need\") are cast in a new light given Palahniuk's recent coming out of the closet, surprising many fans.    On to the DVD itself.  I own many, and this one contains the most extra material including but not limited to extensive commentary, Fight Club paraphernelia, a couple hilarious PSA's and a cool music video.  It's considered by many to be one of the most comprehensive DVD's ever produced.  As to negatives: the film has some fairly graphic violence and a great deal of cussing & cursing, the latter of which detracts from a script (IMO).  If you can move past this, get this DVD or at least give it a rent and watch what is destined to be one of the most talked-about classics of all time",

The costuming is modern and the acts form a very cohesive story (much more so than Riverdance), but the superposition of romance, tragedy, and war on a dance invented for celebration seems...contradictory at best.     The performance is technically excellent, and for some, the military scenes alone will make the DVD worth it. But the Irish Legend - a tale of a first officer and a queen who betray their king not unlike Lancelot and Guinevere - has Griana truncating her forms so as not to bounce too much during her lament, and both leads trying to express longing without breaking Irish posture during their romance. In that sense, watching Dancing on Dangerous Ground is kind of like admiring a painting of the sunset over a tropical beach done in glorious black and white. Even if you think black and white photography is beautiful, and love sunsets and the tropics, you end up wishing that the painter had chosen to change either the subject, or the medium.     The one place where medium and subject DO work well is in the military scenes, where Irish precision is put to amazing use; then the watcher can feel the rhythm and the power conveyed, even through the TV screen. But in the scenes in between, I found myself craving a no-hold-barred energetic number that expressed the joy of Irish dance (like the ones which made Riverdance famous), and wishing for the full upper-body expression of a ballet during some oddly stilted during laments and romantic scenes.     As an Irish dance piece it's well executed, and as a ballet the costuming is inventive and the music beautiful, but there's an odd quality to watching it. Sometimes it gives the impression of muted color, sometimes of undersold majesty, but always there's the feel that the passion, while *almost* there, is somehow still missing.",

Even if one begins righteously, that is with a proper justification, the physical realities of what happens on the battle field are no less horrific. There are tools on the battle field that are there strictly to turn your average teeny-bopper into softball sized chunks of red stuff (I mean that literally).  Verhoeven understands this and does an excellent job of contrasting that reality with the type of fantasy rationalization that is required to (at least successfully) prosecute large scale violence. For me the most poignant moment in the film is when then main characters confront the Bugs for the first time and witness a fellow soldier being ripped to shreds. The female trooper who \"Joined to have babies...\" makes an absolutely blood curdling shriek and then turns to run.  The look on the actress's face and the sound of her voice, completely captures the feeling one gets when one is being fired at in anger. Whether one admits it or not. I highly recommend this film. I think it should be required viewing.",

The premise was an obvious rip off an Outer Limits episode (Straight and Narrow), but I was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a feature-length format.  I was sadly disappointed.  The film eliminated everything that was interesting about the Outer Limits episode, and instead filled itself with...nothing.  In the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the \"bad guys\" about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect.  By the time the credits rolled, I was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea, when properly executed, and I don't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers.  To sum up: don't watch this movie.  It's bad.  Watch the 1990's Outer Limits episode, \"Straight and Narrow,\" starring Ryan Philippe, instead",

            "input": "Antwone Fisher  (2002) . Director:  Denzel Washington  Cast:  Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson.  Running Time:  120 minutes  Rated PG-13 for violence, language and mature thematic material involving child abuse.    Based on a true story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book, \"Antwone Fisher\" is at heart a study of psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents (which are generally good) with the various workings of his film's plot, which can be argued about.  Antwone Fisher's story starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain. Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and Fisher is a catalyst for his own change.     Fisher's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks. The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish without further comment, as if further exploration of this side to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary.  Perhaps sensing this central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child. During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation' justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - \"I don't know what to do\" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss, either in front or behind the camera.     This is Washington's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, \"Antwone Fisher\" is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn't have to endure such horrors.",

It was not long after Easy Rider and we had the idea that this Jack Nicholson had something to say to our 60's-70's counter-culture.  He did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting I had ever seen. He out-classed the James Dean's and Marlon Brando's, but not with ease.  Jack was workin' hard, switching from depressed concert pianist to hillbilly good time dude to misunderstood Romeo in five-minute intervals.  No, make that changeable temperament every five seconds, truly an artistic milestone. Throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by Karen Black, sexy and hillbilly; Jessica Simpson, eat your heart out, and you have the couple of the year, 1970.    Jack's father is one of those evil patriarch's that hurt their kids bad, pushing them to greatness without an ounce of love.  Consequently, the siblings are brilliant and eccentric.  The daughter is a frumpy dope.  The older son is a violinist with a neck injury, and then there's handsome Jack, shiftless, moving from bed to bed, crossing the country, a boozing bum.  Back in the Vietnam years there was an examination of bourgeois life.  Did we have to get a job and get married?  Was everyone in a particular cubbyhole, mail in the funeral?  Hence, we had the counter-culture, drugs, long haired hippies, sexual openness, and shiftless lifestyles. Bob Rafelson's film gives you that, but mercifully, with subtly.  That last scene at the gas station says it all.  I think directors would be hard pressed to sum up a film's theme so effectively with so little noise - amazing.",

Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror.

The supporting cast did their jobs perfectly, each normal in their own way with the exception of Garreth.

            "input": "Realistic, Yet Hopeless War Story. . Based upon director and writer Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.    Despite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.  Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.    I was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I've never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one's soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS)",

The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.    It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.    The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.    Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.    This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.

Gere is so winsome (I'll pay to watch him dance any day, he is aging gorgeously!), and Lopez so elegant, and all the other characters so interesting, and the music so sexy, why quibble over which movie is better? This story is entertaining and touching in its own right, even if not as nuanced and heartfelt as the Japaese version. I have watched ballroom dancing competitions for years, and this film conveys the romance and excitement that draws people to those competitions. The story is charming, adult and PG with a  satisfying ending -- how rare is that combination these days?

I find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the \"n\" word so much. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive, female and Jewish. If Larry the Cable guy ever said the \"n\" word on a comedy DVD, I guarantee you that Al Sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick.     Keep in mind that Silverman has been dating Jimmy Kimmel of \"The Man Show\" fame for many years. Though I am a female, I did truly enjoy The Man Show, though I thought it wasn't as ironic as many people would have you believe. Anti-PC \"irony\" is really a protective screen for telling the kind of jokes most people only tell among themselves, and don't have the gonads to do so in public.

There were also some bad lapses of reality. These include:  1. The claim that the airplane had never been test-flown or simulated when out of gas.  2. Having some sports cars whiz by only feet away - on a wet surface no less - from recreational hot-rodders parked on the abandoned runway who are working on cars and milling about.   3. The apparently stupid teen who can't hear his father yelling and waving at him from 30 feet away to get the hell off the runway as the plane is about to land on him.  The worst for last...     4. No one even attempts any crash position during the landing.  5. After landing, the pilot and co-pilot sit there for 10 seconds and contemplate the minor amount of smoke coming up through the console. Note there is no actual fire whatsoever...  6. After all the passengers slide down the rear slide, the co-pilot and other crew slide down, and gather right at the bottom of the slide rather than, say, getting off the runway away from the plane. Only the pilot remains on board. He lingers in the doorway, then decides to go back into the nose again. Why? To fight the nonexistent fire. Egads! He is now overcome by smoke. We wait and wait for him to reappear, but gosh, he doesn't. So the crew must climb back up the ladder to rescue him. Finally everyone gets off the plane.

Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!     It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it. Call it almost watchable.    I came away from Lawn Dogs (Yawn Dogs?) feeling not at all enriched.

Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie.

The destiny of Peter Bogdanovich is amazing: celebrated as one of the world's best directors in the early 70s, he fell into disgrace because of private problems in the 80s, and rarely got a chance to direct anymore except for TV. Somehow it reminds me of the destiny of Wim Wenders, also celebrated as the new big thing in the 70s, and much disregarded today.  Both judgements were excessive. They probably weren't the best directors in the world in the 70s - but surely aren't the worst today.    This movie is a little, much under-rated and overlooked, certainly humble and understated gem. Bogdanovich shows here what it means to direct actors in a way that enhances their performances and brings out deep emotions. This is not a superficial movie. Instead, it is one that bears repeated viewings. And it has much of what life has: truth, emotions, changes. I especially like the ending. It seems to get back to the beginning, but it's not. Somehow, everything is there, but everything has changed forever. It's a happy ending, but bittersweet too. And like real life, it goes on, on a road where you can't follow, just like those friends you had and never met again, or just like your past memories.    I've been waiting for a decade to get a dvd of this movie. And I bought it immediately as it came out, because it is really unsure that they may ever reprint this once the first bunch is gone. So get it, don't miss it, this is the best advice I can give. Don't miss the experience of this movie. This is no special fx movie. This is actors cinema at its best. Something rare",

The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.  Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.  It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.  If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market",

This Korean film, directed by Kim Ki-Duk, features Ji-Min Kwak as Yeo-jin, a high school girl who runs a small prostitution business with her friend Jae-young (played by the cute as a button Yeo-reum Han, acting here under the name Min-jeong Seo, according to Imdb.)    These two girls are best friends and seem to do everything together.  To raise money so they can fly to Europe, Jae-young comes up with the prostitution idea.  She sleeps with the clients and actually enjoys it, while Yeo-jin makes the arrangements and keeps the money.  Things go bad one day when two cops follow Jae-young up to her liaison in a motel, and attempting to escape, jumps from the window to her death.    Yeo-jin is distraught at the loss of her best friend and beset with guilt over having the money entrusted to her.  To alleviate her conscience, she arranges liaisons with Jae-young's clients to give back the money.  However, when her father, a cop on the vice squad, discovers what she's up to, things take a dark turn for both himself and his daughter's customers.    This film seemed like several in one.  It starts off as a story about the friendship of two school girls, turns into a tale of about guilt and redemption, and then turns into a story about revenge and a lack of communication.  I'd like to have seen more of the friendship (with more screen time for Yeo-reum Han), and some things seem rather far-fetched, but it's a thought provoking film and I liked it overall.    The film is presented on DVD by Tartan Video and has one very serious flaw that I've never seen before on disc:  for the last ten or fifteen minutes, there's a quite visible bar running vertically through the picture about a third of the way in from the left.  It's as though I was watching a broadcast with a weak signal.  I couldn't believe I was seeing such a thing.  Did anybody at Tartan look at this transfer before committing it to disc?  I'm thinking of writing them to say that, after seeing this, I must seriously question getting any more of their titles.    Otherwise, the film is presented at 1.78:1, widescreen enhanced.  The picture is okay but not great - kind of on the dark side, and certainly not among the sharpest that I've seen.  It is watchable, though.  I listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it sounded like a regular stereo soundtrack with no special audio effects.    An interesting film, and I'd like to see more by this director, but the transfer problem at the end is unforgiveable.      Ratings:  Film - 4 stars;  DVD transfer - 2 stars",

Yes, the acting is overdone (or \"stylized,\" if you're one of the people enamored of this film). The plot is implausible and absurd (or \"fantasy-like and surreal\"). The musical choices are a bizarre hodge-podge (or \"brilliantly eclectic\"). About the only thing there could be no argument about is Ms Lane: you know how good she looks now? Imagine what she looked like in 1984 in a red and black leather mini-dress. I think my feelings are best summed up by the monologue of Raven in this 1984 box-office bomb that I've seen more times than any other film besides Escape from New York: \"You're making this harder than it has to be. You and me fall in love for a week or two. I let you go. No one gets hurt.\" That's what you do with this film for 90 minutes.

A nice feature of the DVD is the Performance Only section, as well as the commentary. It does bog down a little in the middle, but picks right back up again as soon as the band hits the stage. Some of the comments are very funny. The black & white photography lends a \"historic\" feel. It's way better than it should be, given the time & technology advances since then.

This is the true story of Teena Brandon (Hillary Swank), a lonely teenage girl living as a man, \"Brandon Teena.\"  She's been in trouble with the law and has no roots.  When she comes to a new town, she is befriended by a \"family\" of perpetually drunk low-lifes, and is especially attracted to Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who dreams of going to Memphis and being a karaoke singer.  Brandon and Chloe fall in love, angering two men who begin to suspect Brandon's true identity.    Swank's performance as Brandon/Teena is simply remarkable.    She conveys the heartbreak and misery of an outsider, a misfit, and the need for love that is universal; she won the Oscar in 1999 for this role.  Sevigny is convincing as the girl who falls in love with both Brandon and Teena.  Despite its low-budget (Swank earned only $3,000), this is an extremely well-made, thought-provoking, and deeply moving for adults.  (There are sexual and extremely violent scenes.)  A riveting, shocking, and very sad story with sensitive acting and direction",

            "input": "\"What does it mean? It makes no sense.\" . Fifty-five minutes into this film, after Freya (Jane March) listens to the Beast's explanation of his current condition--it is the punishment of Odin for killing a bear--she says, \"What does it mean? It makes no sense.\"     Although there is still half an hour yet to come, these eight words pretty much sum up this low-budget variant of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" The very title BLOOD OF BEASTS (plural) makes no sense. The film shows us only one beast--a kind of man-bear--and he is a revived and metamorphosed version of Odin's pet bear, blended or fused with the man who killed it. Academic scholars might argue that swaggering-but-cowardly Sven (played by William Gregory Lee) is a kind of beast as well (thus giving us TWO beasts), but we have no way of knowing what the writer and director intended. Most likely the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who had not seen the film. Surely the blurb on the back of the DVD's hard case was written by another marketing person who never watched it either; e.g., it is untrue that Freya \"must undertake a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a tormented monster . . . cast out by his people.\" Nor is it true that \"the Beast [singular] . . . battles with Freya for his redemption.\" Further, expect no truth in these grand-sounding words: \"Prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, damnation and salvation.\" BTW, the front of the hard case has a fake sepia picture of Jane March/Freya shooting an arrow in an impossible manner: the arrow's shaft is two or three inches ABOVE her hand that's gripping the bow.     With one exception, the acting is a perfect match for the script: laughably poor. The exception is the Beast (played by David Dukas). One is tempted to quip that only this role has \"teeth\"; the fact is that only his role permits audio engineers (or whoever) to enhance the actor's voice electronically, only his role required serious make-up, and only his role required a \"special effect\" (his morphing back to Agnar, which every semi-conscious viewer, by a third of the way into the film, knew was coming).     Other viewers have commented on the comical tropical setting of this Viking saga and the laughable \"ships.\" Most preposterous is the tiny skiff that Freya and Ingrid (Candice Hillebrand) use to rescue King Thorsson (Greg Melvill-Smith). On the island, the Beast possesses an iron cage (which clearly has been welded together using 20th- or 21st-century equipment); when the king is confined in it, it can only be secured from the outside--and yet, when Freya is put inside it for her own protection at night, only she has control of its locking device. How convenient.     The costumes are also anacronistically interesting, but only Ms. March's deserve extended comment. When we first see her, she is wearing a little black Viking bikini as she swims with friends; then, besides flimsy chain mail, we see her in an array of gowns that seem to be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics--the final one being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top.     Lest this review seem too harsh, a few individuals connected with this film deserve special mention for their outstanding contributions: Mark Thomas, who composed the Viking music; Rob Bishop, one of the focus pullers; Ryan Lotter and Steven Ndlovu, two clapper loaders; Andrew Gribble, a grip; Ben Phiri, the generator operator; Guy Bonner, transport manager; Johannes Sithole, fabrication assistant; Kirsty Taylor, prosthetics; Maxmillian van der Merwe, standby set dresser; Dirk Knoesen, stand-by [sic] carpenter; Sally van der Merwe, scenic artists [sic]; Janine Wyatt-Mair, stunt performer; Grace Sibiyo, seamstress; Diane Allen, hair supervisor; Bianca, trainee make-up assistant; Ian Thysse, medic; and Mark Ferda, who did double duty as both dialogue editor AND re-recording mixer.     Oh, one more thing: after coming out of her cage in the morning, Jane March SEEMS to have a nude swim in the sea, which the poor Beast views from hiding, far-far-far away",

But then I realized that if you're reviewing a DVD, 90% of the review must be based on the movie itself, and having saw the movie when it was released, and having seen it again on the various cable channels, I felt I could write a respectable reveiw.    Frankly, the movie barely approaches a \"B-Movie\" status. It's only claim to fame is that it was the first major Hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light.    The plot is rather unbelievable, naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field.... successful author, high-ranking network producer, top-rate doctor. Nobody has a profession, or is in a position, with which the audience can relate. The dialog is forced and, at times, rather cliche. Acting is acceptable, though supporting cast members are rather amateurish. Direction is functional, at best.    One glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary. After or before key scenes, the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters. The effect is startling, doesn't advance the story, and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the already-weak emotional impact of the film.    To its credit, the actors did whole-heartedly portray gay characters and gay love scenes. At the time, gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media, and it was a great risk to do so here. There were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on, and they did the best they could.    It was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be ground-breaking and revolutionary, but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society. This is absolutely proven by the fact that Brokeback Mountain, released about two decades later, had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that Making Love previously attempted to break. The difference is that Brokeback Mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes, and Making Love all but disappeared in the annals of time.    If you're a collector of good film, this really wouldn't be part of your collection. To add into a collection of films showing early portrayals of homosexuals and homosexual relationships, it would be very appropriate. Sadly, it really is good for only that one reason, as part of a collection of gay films throughout the years",

The review on the back of the dvd says \"jaw dropping, \" but the full quote probably reads \"jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)\". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant \"evil side of human nature\" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How To pamphlet and said \"yeah, it needs some CONFLICT\". If these characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of \"social commentary,\" but that's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn't.  You'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's dramatic rags.     All that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads.

They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.    As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.    The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.    Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.",

            "input": "Why Didn't Anybody Tell Me They Made A Movie Of This? . Why am I only finding out now that there was a film of `Slaughterhouse Five'? The advent of DVD has brought back some great films that have been lost or forgotten.    Everywhere I go I'm told that `Slaughterhouse Five' was the greatest book ever written. But I've never gotten around to reading it. The film leaves no doubt that in print or on film this is one of the greatest stories ever told.     The Plot: This is what I've always asked. \"What is this great story `Slaughterhouse Five' about?\" Now that I know I can see why all my friends were at a loss to explain it.    The story does not sound intriguing in theory but is great in practice. `Slaughterhouse Five' is about a man Billie Pilgrim who is \"lost in time\" that is, every 30 seconds he jumps forward or backward to a different time in his life. Somewhat similar to `Memento' except it was 5 minutes and he was always going backwards.    Billie Pilgrim's life has three main settings. He was drafted into WWII and taken prisoner at the Battle of the Bulge. As a POW he is taken to Dresden and survives the single worst massacre of WWII. In the 1950s he experiences suburban life as a father. And in his later years he is abducted by aliens and enslaved with a topless movie star to reproduce.    See what I mean, these are three very odd stories that shouldn't work together. There is the very serious issue of Dresden, the \"open city\" in Germany with no armed forces or war production which was inhabited by European refugees hoping to wait out the war in peace. But on February 14 1945 the Allies decided to destroy German moral by ordering hundreds of British and American bombers to fire bomb the city. On February 15 they returned, and on the 16th they sent in American fighters to machine gun as many survivors as possible. 135,000 civilians died, more than Hiroshima or Nagasaki. A rather serious issue for a sci-fi film.    Why is Billie lost in time? We never know but suspect it may be because he's abducted by aliens where he says time does not exist. Or it may be that after a plane crash he has brain surgery.     Billie is a likeable character because he doesn't really say or do anything on his own. Billie does not shape events, events shape him. He didn't go to Dresden because he wanted to, he gets married and works only because that is what's expected of him. And the aliens abduct him.    Billie is not so much an actor as he is an observer. And his loss of time is just like everyone else. One moment I'm writing this review and the next I'm back to last night watching this film. Our minds jump to different times in our lives.    As for the production quality of this film, it's great. The WWII scenes are very authentic and high budget. The acting is good although there are no notable actors. Billie is played by Michael Sacks whose filmography is thin and unotable. I only remember him as the hostage cop in `Sugarland Express'. The topless actress is played by Valerie Perrine who you may remember as Lex Luther's girlfriend in the `Superman' films.     `Slaughterhouse Five' may sound as bizarre as its title named after Billie's POW barracks, but it's a very powerful story that will make you laugh, cry, and smile. I can't believe a film buff like me didn't know about. It just shows you how many lost gems are being found on DVD.",

The same cinematographer from the original returns for the remake, and there are some very nice nods to the original; The part w/Leatherface chasing one victim through the clotheslines hung with lots of white sheets was a memorable moment for me..But make no mistake: This movie is brutal in it's violence, and there is alot of it. And while not really 'scary'(except for Sheriff Hoyt...YIKES!!!), this is one intense, horrific ride. The comment on the box read \"If you want horror...this IS horror!!\".

            "input": "The importance of not being too earnest... . I really wanted to like this film.  It hurts not to recommend it, because the subject matter is extraordinary and compelling: a once-in-a-lifetime night in American theater that happened during the Great Depression.  And Tim Robbins' heart is in the right place.  But great intentions don't make a great film, and unfortunately, that's the case here.  Robbins tries to do a multiple-character loose plot that makes one think of Robert Altman.  In fact, watching Cradle Will Rock, you realize just how good Altman is, because he makes this sort of thing look so effortless (so much so that detractors have often accused him of \"not really directing\" his pictures).  Well, to quote the late senator Lloyd Bentsen: Tim Robbins, you're no Bob Altman.    The film has an impressive cast list.  Unfortunately, almost everyone overacts (or is overdirected by Robbins, since these actors have turned in other fine performances).  Particular violators are Cary Ewles as John Houseman and Angus Macfadyen as Orson Welles.  Both seem to channel Nathan Lane in their over-the-top elocution and both as directed by Robbins turn every showbiz cliche in the book, such as bickering pettily and then, when they reach an agreement over something, jumping up and down and shouting \"Eureka!\" while hugging.  Other hams include Ruben Blades as painter Diego Rivera and, surprisingly, the normally spot-on Susan Sarandon as Mussolini's art-living mistress.  (With her over-bearing accent she sounds more like Count Dracula's mistress.)  Other cliched characters include doe-eyed Emily Watson as a shy waif who never gets a break in life until, of course, the last scene.    There's also a strange sideplot involving Bill Murray (okay, he does not overact; *can* Bill Murray overact?) as a washed-up ventriloquist.  This started off promising, with him attending secret meetings sponsored by alienated conservatives who see the times changing in ways that make them uncomfortable, but it really went nowhere in my opinion.  Conversly, the third (third!) major plotline, about Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera to paint a mural in his new building, went predictably where we'd expect, and was way too drawn out in the film's ending.  Oddly, for a screenplay that cried out for lots of oddball, nonconformist characters, no lines and little face time are given Corina Katt Ayala as Frida Kahlo--who in real life was quite a character who could have been put to better use here.  Also underused is the always-reliable Bob Balaban.  Hank Azaria is okay as the playwright, but the whole surreal bits that happen whenever he has a scene to write or perform strike me as Robbins trying to be arty and \"profound.\"    The one standout performance is by Cherry Jones, wonderful as Hallie Flanagan.  Her warm and very natural performance just throws into high relief how forced and phony most of the rest of the cast is.  Even here, though, Robbins misses the point.  The high moment comes when Balaban shakes her into reality after the Congressional hearings and tells her \"It's over.\"  That could have been the beginning of a big dramatic scene, but Robbins glosses over it for a phony and smug mock-interrogation in the court chambers--preaching to us like we're third graders who can't be trusted to figure it out ourselves.  Similarly, the walk down the street to the second theater that begins the climax could have been a big dramatic moment--what will be the fate of this controversial play, and the actors who have rehearsed it for months?  Instead Robbins gives us a victory dance before the victory--a parade of jugglers, acrobats and cha-cha dancers set to comical klezmer music that undermines what he's just set up.  We feel a satisfaction and--I hate to keep using this word but it's true--smugness, before the big night even happens.  And I'll leave it to you to decide the effectiveness--and the ultimate meaning--of the very last shot.  I still haven't decided if it works, but it was a bold idea.    Another big part of what sinks this movie is the hammy score.  It may seem piddling to talk about background music, but it really breaks the movie.  The music was done by David Robbins--Tim's brother.  Nepotism rears its ugly head.  Robbins' music is usually inappropriate--slapstick and overly broad like the rest of the film's elements, as though Robbins doesn't trust us to follow him and feels he has to drive home his message with power tools.  Yet despite the constant heavy-handedness, Cradle Will Rock never finds its tone--part history lesson, part \"serious drama,\" part broadsided \"comedy,\" it can't ultimately decide if it wants to hit you in the head with a hammer or in the face with a pie.  It tries both by the end, and neither works.    Ultimately, I felt like Robbins couldn't get a distance from his material.  He lectures us to the point that the word MESSAGE in bright red practically flashes on the screen.  Understatement is not in his bag of tricks.  It's not that I disagree with much of what he has to say, but he fairly hits you over the head with it, and acts as though he's the first one to show you upper-class hypocracy.  The one really interesting plot thread--about how the Hallie Flanagans of the world were called before the House UnAmerican Committee to defend their loyalty while the Hearsts of America appeased dictators by buying art from them (and thereby financing their fascism)--is the highlight of the film.  But even here Robbins stages a garish costume party to drive home the point and again whips out the power tools.  Tim, we get it.    Despite this negative review, the film might be interesting to see just for the fascinating history lesson that it is.  Or you could go online or to a library and find some nonfiction material on the subject matter.  I read somewhere that originally none other than Orson Welles himself was set to make this film, but the deal never got off the ground and then he died.  That's too bad.  I would like to have seen what he could have done with this material.  As it is, Robbins is too close to it--too loud, too preachy, too self-righteous--to pull it off.",

Kevin Spacey is fantastic as a CIA agent with heart.  Tony Goldwyn, son of Samuel Goldwyn (i.e. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer - MGM) is perfect as the \"true company man\" for the White House NSC.  Alan Arkin, a long-time favorite of mine, plays an Israeli colonel turned into a Mossad agent.  And the characters playing the Iraqis are really, really good.  Get the movie.  It's pretty factual and quite amazing indeed.    Here's a few additional facts about the story to intrigue you:    Dr. Gerald Bull was the founder of Space Research Corporation.  A Canadian ballistics expert, Bull modified artillery weapons, worked on the USA's HAARP gun program and upgraded SCUD missiles for various customers. He did work for every country, except Russia, which he hated (but the SCUD's he modified were Russian-made). He also did work, through the CIA, for the USA and some of its allies.   His modified SCUD's rained down on Israel and Saudi Arabia, killing Israelis and American troops.    Dr. Bull had to run things through the customs services of many countries of course to move his weapons. He ran afoul of U.S. Customs and got a year in a federal penitentiary for which he did not forgive the CIA, instead expecting immunity.     Bull was contracted by Saddam Hussein, who at that time was a pro-U.S. interest (against Iran and supported by then-Vice-President Bush) to build a \"Supergun\" that would fire a 2,000 lb shell over 100 miles (and further). Saddam's hope was to be able to shell Israel with bio/chem weapons from an artillery gun (which is not uncommon) but from great range.  Israel had destroyed Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor (designed to produce weapons-grade plutonium) for which Saddam vowed revenge.  The Mossad gave a lot of warnings to Bull about helping Iraq arm, which Bull repeatedly ignored.     the CIA and British MI6 turned a blind eye to Bull's operations in Iraq, for which Bull, expecting protection, gave them info on the German bunkers and C&C centers Saddam had constructed underground. Ah, but in the spy business there are no sweethearts, and the Mossad assassinated Bull in Brussels before he could finish the \"Supergun\" (the Babylon Gun). A smaller version, the \"Baby Babylon\" gun had been completed and tested at that time.  However, in the movie they give the suggestion MI-6 assassinated Bull as they show a silencer being screwed onto the barrel of what looks like a Walthers PPK.    This was all financed through a \"bank\" in America where funds were diverted from American taxpayers to Saddam, ostensibly for agricultural enterprises.  Saddam reportedly paid Bull $25 million for his work.  The myopic viewpoint at the time was that any enemy of Iran (i.e. Iraq) is a friend of the USA. Didn't quite work out that way.    After Bull was dead, MI6 feigned surprise at the discovery of \"Supergun\" barrel pieces being constructed in a foundry in England and they were impounded before they could all be shipped out (on Iraqi IL-76 transports I believe). Some pieces did make it out to Iraq.     Thus the silly and complicted politics of the Middle East. Where the USA once propped up the Shah of Iran and sold him 79 F-14A Tomcats, he was deposed and Iran became a U.S. enemy, and still is to this day.  Saddam, a former protected entity, invaded Kuwait less than 6 months after Bull was assassinated, on August 2, 1990 - and the rest was seen on CNN 24 hours per day",

            "input": "Not brave enough . An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators:    I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of \"Treasure Island.\"  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version.    It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of \"Treasure Island\" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them.    What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe.    Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is.    Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of \"a seafaring man with one leg.\"  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there.    The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke.    The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a \"thundering apoplexy\" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from \"death at the hands of the pirates.\"  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to \"be like the little children in order to be saved.\"    To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave.    To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice.",

Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said \"Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut.\" Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some \"Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house.",

I have no idea what these people are talking about.  Yes, some episodes were better than others and some plotlines were tedious, but I still thought this was a great season.  The main theme of this season is the planning of Monica and Chandler's wedding, but there are many storylines scattered throughout, such as Rachel's romance with her assistant, Joey returning to Days of Our Lives, the brief return of Phoebe's scientist boyfriend, and Ross learning to play bagpipes.  This season will have you in stitches!    Here's a list of my favorite episodes from this season:    The One With Phoebe's Cookies  The One With Rachel's Assistant  The One With the Nap Partners  The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs  The One With All the Candy  The One With the Holiday Armadillo  The One Where Rosita Dies  The One Where They All Turn Thirty  The One With Joey's New Brain  The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress  The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin  The One With the Vows  The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding    Next is the season where Rachel is pregnant!

His work from 1999 up through Sign O' the Times was nothing short of genius, but for some reason he decided to turn his attention away from groundbreaking, genre-busting work and concentrate more on being a run-of-the-mill R&B and funk revue - complete with dance troupe and annoying horn section.    This is Prince Vegas-afied. He's become a caricature of his former self.  Listen to his older stuff like \"Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" or \"Lady Cab Driver\" and compare it to the dreck he's come out in the 90's.  It's like night and day.    Prince dances, sings, plays guitar (underwhelmingly) all over this DVD, but it just feels like Prince has become a cheap, glitzy version of himself. And the \"Jeebus\" stuff gets real ridiculous real quick as well.    I'd love to see Prince just strip it down to a four or five piece band (sans horns) and get back to being about the music and not the spectacle.  He could have been one of the great music stars in history, but he's decided instead to just be another R&B revue... shame, really.    That said, The Time comes to DELIVER THE GOODS, and kicks His Royal Badness to the curb with great performances of \"Jungle Love\" and \"The Bird\".  I'd have rather seen them headline the DVD!",

            "input": "Not so fair and completely unbalanced - see my media scorecard . Pundits would have you believe that Fox news and Rupert Murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism.  They even based a Bond villian on Murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies. Nothing gets a liberal's eyes rolling than when you say you watch Fox News.  This Attackumentary wants you to believe that Fox is biased and not credible.  Watch this Attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions.    The former reporters gripe throughout this \"piece\" that Rupert Murdoch changed how reporters operate, for the worse in their opinion.  What actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change.  They had to work hard, something they probably never did before.  Murdoch, like any driven person, demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees.  Those that could hang, rose with Fox news.  Those that could not keep up appear in \"OutFoxed\".    Fox does have a bias on its commentary section.  This draws ratings.  The thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the Journalism from the Commentary sections even with Fox putting a big sign up saying \"Commentary\".  They are so used to their \"Mainstream\" liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they cannot tell the difference anymore.    Here is my latest scorecard:  Mainstream Media:  Latest and greatest from Reuters, a major supplier of news to the always objective \"mainstream media\"; fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened.  This photographer decided that his photos (or the war) was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image.  How many other war photos have been doctored this way?  On the Reuters' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage.  You had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story.  I guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident.     The bastion of liberal \"non-thinking\"; New York Times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on.  In other words, they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events.  They also revealed secrets that hurt the World's efforts on fighting terrorists.  CNN - Nicknamed the Clinton News Network during the 90's for swallowing anything the Clintons had to give and asking for seconds, the only thing they were upset about during the whole Lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk.  On their online \"News Headlines\" section they repeatedly have Lou Dobb's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news.  Lou Dobb's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for CNN and everything he states is opinion not news.  You would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike Fox they don't have one.  They think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news.  USA Today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal.  Oops, turns out it wasn't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily.  Over 70% of the American population agreed with the Bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating.    CBS's Dan Rather, this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the Republican revolution swept through Congress in 1994.  All his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away.  He launched a smear campaign against President Bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable.  His background investigation was nil.  People discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it.  After everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant.  The editor for the Los Angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the 2004 election.  Finally there is Newsweek, whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries.  They were so eager to report the desecration of Islam's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened.  They ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves.  The blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain?   That is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer. If so, that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the World.  Perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues.      These are just minor examples of how the \"Mainstream\" Media operates.  These are real stories and influence real events in the world, sometimes with serious consequences.  This is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day.  If you want more then read the book Bias by Bernard Goldberg to get a real understanding.  I will stick to Fox News as I have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news.  Like any prudent person I take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means.  I do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct.  CNN, Reuters, CBS, Newsweek, NY Times all fall squarely into the \"dubious at best\" category.    All I have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because Fox separates the opinions from the facts,allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and America loves them for it.    The liberals hate Fox news.   Fox actually investigates and reports on what happened; not what the liberals wished would have happened.  They show the liberals for what they are, full of $%$^.  They hated it when Fox repeatedly showed then President Clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up, that is until he saw a TV camera and started shedding crocodile tears.    Fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the 90's was due mostly to Newt Gingrich.  Clinton had a disastrous first 2 years of his presidency.  Gingrich's congress would not send Clinton the pork barrel projects so he couldn't spend to excess.  I wish we had Gingrich leading the congress doing the same to President Bush.    I am sure Rupert Murdoch is feeling \"Outfoxed\"; right now his network is ranked numero Uno as it has been for some time.  This DVD is hovering between 2000 and 3000.  I am ranked higher than it is.",

Everyone remembers the 1963 series where Dr. Richard Kimble (David Janssen) goes running around in every episode just missing the criminal that killed his wife. He in turn is being chased by Lt. Philip Gerard (Barry Morse) who thinks Kimble did it and is a fugitive from the law. The whole thing was narrated by William Conrad.    Well now we have the movie. This time we have a beginning middle and ending all in 161 minutes.     Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and his wife Helen (Sela Ward) are the perfect couple. Then one night while he was working for some inexplicable reason a despicable person dispatches Helen. On her way to the netherworld she inadvertently says Richard on the 911 call. One thing leads to another and Kimble gets the blame. In the process of transporting him from one containment system to another the transport meets with a little accident; now Kimble is free to find locate the real perpetrator. Now it is up to Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) to find and retrieve Kimble.    Now that we have covered the basic there is not where to begin to tell how great this movie is on many levels. The anticipation of the chase of Kimble to find the perpetrator (by the way he has only one arm) before Gerard catches him. We get close and have a few read herrings. Tommy Lee gets to keep his stoic look as he says things like \"I don't care.\" And \"I don't bargain.\"     Personaly I think that the Chicago police knew all along who the real bad guy was and was covering for him several times right up to the end. They went out of there way to paint Kimble as the bad guy.  Detective Rosetti (Joseph F. Kosala) also tried to stop him from revealing the real perpetrator. Rosetti referring to Kimball even after the truth is revealed \"He's going down. You won't help us, you stay the hell out!\"",

His psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel.

Casting the cowboys they used a mix of Hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills.  This worked out incredibly well.

It is a film about stories from around Wisconsin as reported in a paper from Black River Falls, with some hokey footage of modern (1990's) day Black River Falls.    There are very few photographs from the period and the film footage is mostly an attempt at what I can only call \"modern art\".  Cut out about 20 minutes of \"filler\" and this would be a somewhat better film.    Basically, it's a collection of \"strange but true stories\" that have no connection to each other, except they took place around the same period of time and took place somewhere in the state of Wisconsin.  And the modern footage makes no positive contribution at all.  In fact, if I was from Black River Falls, I would be upset about how the town is portrayed.    A complete waste of time and film",

Though the non-linear presentation can sometimes confuse the viewer, it takes only a moment to realize the correlation between the last portrait and the next. So, be patient;)    This film has a bit of a postmodern spin (which many horror-film scholars may enjoy).  One of the main characters, Kyoko Harase, plays an actress known as \"The Queen of Horror.\" She is taken to the infamous Saeki home to give a television interview about her own experience as a horror actress. It is there that she is marked with the curse (in a fairly unpredictable way!!) And, there that true horror enters her own life.    To the joy of many viewers, Toshio figures prominently into \"Ju-On 2.\" Though the make-up on Toshio is a little flat (unlike \"Ju-On The Grudge\") his acting is still pitch-perfect. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that Yuya Ozeki (who play Toshio Saeki) did not understand the part he was playing in earlier films (simply as a result of his tender age). He has now refused to watch his own films and his parents go to the premieres alone:) (You can discover this information on the American version of \"The Grudge\" in Takashi Shimizu's commentary).      Some reviewers seem hyper-critical of this work. Yes, the film has some missteps, but they are easily overlooked. If you watched and enjoyed \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" then try \"Ju-on 2\" . . . you might be pleasantly surprised!",

The greatest crime you can commit whilst watching a David Lynch film is to NOT watch it in one-sitting; a reason as to why Mr. Lynch did not condone the insertion of chapter breaks in the original 'Mulholland Drive' DVD&#8212;it happens to be the incentive for the viewer to sit through the whole film in unremitting concentration, a sort of meditation. It would also explain his infatuation with 'Transcendental Meditation', which he claims to have been practicing for a number of years, and his desire to instill that peace into his cult following. So, if by any chance you want to unravel this smorgasbord of haunting sexuality, bloody violence, and the mystical bizarreness which is 'Lost Highway' then it is wise to stray away from the conviction of a linear plot. It is much more lucrative to compare the chief theme of each his films rather than trying to put together the scattered images of one film&#8212;let&#8217;s say, as an example, the 'Mystery Man' (Played by Robert Blake in this particular film) and the 'Cowboy' from 'Mulholland Drive'; you can draw the correspondence at once by comparing their facial elements: mainly the shaved eyebrows. Therewith, one can surmise what Lynch tried to personify by those two characters&#8230;a singularly obscure despot&#8212;evil&#8212;like the devil, and also the gateway into the supernatural. Indeed, in a recent interview, director Lynch confessed that Lost Highway and Twin Peaks take place in the same world&#8212;which is more than enough evidence for us to navigate all his films since 1977&#8217;s 'Eraserhead' and search for cohesion on the whole rather than through one individual film. All this aside, 'Lost Highway' is certainly a worthy experience; it is singularly intriguing, interspersed with bizarre sexual liaisons and a chilling soundtrack&#8212;a mix of hard-edged techno-industrial, slightly spooky jazz, and orchestral compositions from Angelo Badalamenti. Patricia Arquette & Bill Pullman pull off memorable performances as the husband and wife whose marriage is on the rocks, Balthazar Getty is thoroughly convincing as the 'reincarnation' of Fred Madison (Bill Pullman&#8217;s character in the story) and Robert Loggia playing the sinister mob boss with insidious perversions. 'Lost Highway' may at times frustrate you with its non-linear narrative or it just might not be on-par with your taste, yet you don&#8217;t have to be genius to figure out that during our brief span of consciousness David Lynch certainly knows how to screw our nerves.",

The plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for Streisand's character, making her attractive - no, irresistible - to the main male character.  The problem is, she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover!  Somebody (probably Streisand) thinks that highlighted hair, a tight black cocktail dress, and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress, casual clothes, and everyday looks are disgusting. BAAAAAAMP!  (That's the fallacy alarm going off:  men, in my experience, don't care much about clothes and makeup.)   There was a lot of emphasis placed on the Streisand character's losing weight by riding an exercise bike, but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference!  Yet truly, the low point of the movie is the scene in which Streisand, discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother (played by Lauren Bacall), blubbers, \"Wazz I a pretty baby?  WAZZ I A PRETTY BABYYYYEEEE?\"  In that one scene, Streisand's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed.  The whole movie is about this issue, and it's amazing that an entire cast, crew, and production company would devote themselves to B.S.'s emotional issues like that.  I really think that the \"Funny Girl\" phenomenon somehow ruined Streisand's thought processes.  The media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped, Northern European beauty standard of the time (think Grace Kelly; think Ingrid Bergman.....).  I recall reading about how her glowing complexion, thick hair, and good figure (as well as her energy and voice) carried her through despite her looks:  long nose, large lips, slanted eyes.  Myself, I think she looks like an Egyptian princess or similar; but she certainly doesn't look like Grace Kelly.....  So why can't she accept this?  The majority of us women, whatever our race, color, or bone-structure, learn to live with and love who we are.....at least I hope we do!  This movie is not about that.  This movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable.    Maybe I should've given it only one star",

Mrs. Elizabeth Nash - as played long-sufferingly and with an understated intensity about her performance that can only be called gorgeous - is one of the several centerpieces of this memorable film.    You don't get a clinical presentation of schizophrenia here, and the news coverage following this 2002 film suggests that you don't get a history of Princeton mathematician John Nash's life either.    What you get are epic performances by Russell Crowe and partner Connelly, together with enormously assured supporting roles by Ice King Ed Harris and Paul Bettany, together with the kind of rich and textured cinematography that must have upped Princeton's application rate with its sheer autumnal elegance.    Crowe's heroic battle against the delusions that plagued Dr. Nash's mind are gladiatorial in scope, though it would be difficult to imagine a role more restrained and internal where that famous acting played out violently and before drooling crowds. As one of Rome's famous gladiators, Crowe found redemption by bringing down a sinister emperor. Here he does so by quietly accepting the pens ceremonially laid before him by his Princeton colleagues and then by explaining that 'it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.'    Those who love or have been loved against the infinitude of chaos will understand Dr. Nash's discovery, regardless of whether the real Nash ever said those things from behind a Stockholm podium.    Don't overlook this film when building your posterity collection. As human drama goes, a finely crafted fiction can ring more true than the connected dots of what really went down and who said what",

This is supposedly dry, subtle comedy for people who don't usually like dry, subtle comedy.  It's a show that was presented to the FOX audience, an audeince that normally likes the most inane, low-brow kind of humor, that doesn't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it.    Meanwhile, to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor, the so-called comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable.  Every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke, it's clear how forced and contrived it is, how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor, something they clearly don't understand.  It's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch, because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat.  It's just an awkward mess.    But those aren't the people this show is targeted at.  It's targeted at that FOX audience who has never even seen dry humor before, and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them.  They think this show is brilliant because it's a little smarter than MAD TV, or at least thinks it is.  And since those are the people who are seeing the show, you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is.  If the show were on HBO or some other network, exposed to a different kind of audience, you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works.    So why did this show get cancelled, when so many people think it's so amazing?  If it's so great, people would have actually watched it, right?  So where were the ratings?  The fact is, the people who love this show are a very vocal minority.  The audience for dry humor didn't watch this show because it's not funny.  But the audience who was fooled by this show, as vocal as they are, was just too small:  they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it.    This is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for TV, as its apologists claim.  No, it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes",

Eleven years old when his father, architect Louis Kahn, died in 1974, filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn sets out in search of the man he hardly knew by visiting the sites of his architectural creations, from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, to the capitol building of Bangladesh. Along the way, through interviews, old footage and photographs, much is revealed about this elusive, enigmatic, and often difficult man - including a closely guarded private life with children by three different women, while remaining married to only one of them.    A personal film documenting the life and career of a public man, \"My Architect\" is wonderfully engaging, leaving the viewer with a complexity of emotions as we listen to the comments of those who admired him, those who loved him, and those who did neither. Especially revealing are the interviews with the two women, colleagues in his firm, who became romantically involved with him and years later still treasure the memory of him. An architect in Bangladesh sums up the final image of a man whose work was inspired by a kind of mystical genius and who gave his love to mankind.    Moods mix and shift gracefully in the film from the discomfort of seeming to disagree with his mother's reverent estimation of the man to the sweeping effects of time-lapse photography and a whimsical scene of rollerblading around the great courtyard of the Salk Institute. Included in the DVD is an interesting and informative question and answer period between the filmmaker and a small theater audience, with additional scenes not used in the film.",

One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her. Then David sent a letter to have Uriah killed. Would of been a decent movie without the smut",

This could be another unusual case of an artist not being the best judge of his own work, at least in my opinion I feel the eurythmics' added a unique flavor and spirit to the film. I can understand at the time Radford may have had studio pressure to use them as was overly common practice for just about any film made in the 80's to have a slapped on pop tune soundtrack from whoever the hottest flavor of the year was.

The first thing you notice about Casino Royale is that it is absent of all of the cheesy gimmickery of the old Bond movies. The stunts and effects are believable. The acting is understated and real. The plot is fresh and new.     Daniel Craig's performance gives a hint of Sean Connery. But it's not an imitation of Connery. Craig makes the role his own. This is a whole new Bond. The cliche is that this movie is Bond for the 21st century (the terrorist angle), when it actually just brings Bond back to his roots. He is cunning more than he is charming. (unlike Roger Moore) He is different, he is new, he reinvents what you think a secret agent in her Majesty's secret service should be.    If you are looking for the trademark Bond staples such as the Martini (shaken, not stirred) - the easy women, the endless supply of Aston Martins etc... this movie may disappoint. Craig is rough around the edges but just smooth enough to make you believe that he deserves to be the newest \"double-oh\".    I suggest buying this DVD in 1080p Blu-Ray because of the spectacular cinematography, shot on location in Prague. It won't disappoint.    The best part about the movie, without giving too much away, is that the ending leaves you wanting more. Isn't that the goal of any great series?    I give it 5 stars.",

            "input": "Starts Out Strong, But Fizzles Quickly... . Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, \"The Descent\" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, \"The Descent\"    \"The Descent\" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.    At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.    Even though \"The Descent\" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.    \"The Descent\" is unrated and contains violence and language",

            "input": "Between \"Heaven\" and Hell . The brilliant director of \"Run Lola Run\" and \"The Princess and the Warrior\", Tom Tykwer, has directed another visually stunning, thought provoking and mystical film exploring the relationship of a man and a woman from different backgrounds who find each other and realize that a strong and potent connection exists between the two of them. As in \"The Princess and the Warrior,\" Tykwer combines the real and the surreal to dazzling effect.    The main characters, whose names are \"Phillipa\" and \"Fillipo\" represent opposite or opposing forces who finally become merged into one. \"Phillipa\" the female character, circumvents and subverts society's ineffectual system of laws by taking the law into her own hands, and plans to kill a drug dealer who is in cahoots with the the police. \"Fillipo\", the male character, is in direct contradistinction to Phillipa in that he is a member of the police system that Phillipa feels has failed her, her husband, and her students (she is a teacher). After she is captured, the two find a powerful spiritual connection that transforms and bonds them forever. The roles that were established for the characters blur as Fillipo breaks the laws his job symbolizes and helps Phillipa escape; and Phillipa, racked with guilt over the the inncoent deaths at her hands, is ready to submit to the very same laws that failed her and set all the events in motion. The film, as it progresses, reconciles these opposing forces, and the characters' identities and ideals literally (they begin to look alike) and symbollically (they begin to both believe that there is no real justice in the world) merge into one.    The film, in addition, grows more surreal as it progresses and the bond between the two is cemented both physically and spiritually. Some critics have expressed that the ending is disappointing in the way it leaves the moral aspects of the film unresolved (Phillipa escapes punishment for her crimes). I think they have missed the point in that the main focus of the film, as in most of Tykwer's films, is on the mystical connection of the characters. The last scene, a breathtaking piece of cinema, establishes this connection in a surreal way. Phillipa herself admits that she deserves punishment for her crimes, but in a world that makes no sense, where justice and law rarely live up to their ideals, their last escape makes perfect sense",

Mostly notorious when it was released in 1987 for featuring wholesome sitcom star Lisa Bonet in a sex scene with some nudity (and thereby supposedly offending Bill Cosby), ANGEL HEART has acquired quite a reputation as a cult film since then, some of which is quite deserved for its astonishingly beautiful cinematography and editing. Some of the compositions (particularly two repeated overhead shots of stairwells, one in Harlem and one in New Orleans) are among the most stunning of any film from the 1980s, and the set decorations are similarly out of this world. Though there's also Mickey Rourke's beautiful youthful face (pre-boxing injuries) to be gazed upon, there's really little else to recommend this movie, even if its big twist at the end catches you unawares: the film is basically constructed as a rebus, with various visual (seeming) non sequiturs keying you in to the big narrative surprise at the end. But the big horror moments have almost no suspense built into them, and the acting is fairly shoddy: O'Rourke gives a real hambone performance, and Bonet must be the dullest voodoo priestess ever to appear onscreen. You know what you're in for when the characters have names like \"Harry Angel,\" \"Louis Cyphre,\" \"Toots Sweet,\" and \"Epiphany Proudfoot\"; even the beautiful look of the film can't overcome the shallowness and dispiritedness of the script",

The first is a comedy and the second is a drama. In the first they are buddies, in the second they are enemies. In both, they are splendid.    Individual reviews appear below:    THE CHEYENNE SOCIAL CLUB  This One's a Hoot    Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda play a couple of cowboys working on the range. When Stewart gets a letter he is surprised to learn that his bother has died and left him his business. It is a placed called the Cheyenne Social Club. So it is that Stewart and his sidekick, Fonda, set out for Wyoming with the expectation of becoming respectable business men.    Upon arrival, Stewart learns that he is the most popular and respected man in town. He also learns that his social club is a brothel. This strikes him as not being \"in his line of work\" and he determines to close the place down. That takes him from being the most respected to the most reviled man in town. He has some hard decisions to make and even more trouble appears when he learns that there are contractual agreements between his shop and the railroad. Things get more complicated still when he learns that there are some ruffians roughing up some of his girls.     Stewart is just a nice guy trying to do the \"right thing\". Eventually, he does...much to his own surprise.      FIRECREEK  Sometimes the Little Guys Win    This is another pairing of Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda in a western.     Stewart plays a farmer, respected by his peers and given the honorary title of sheriff in his town. The tile also comes with a home made tin badge and 20 dollars. It is a sign of esteem and nothing more.    Fonda plays the leader of a group of gunmen with vague notions about law and order. When passing through town, they decide to stop there a little while and rest. Nobody really minds that but they do object to being treated like vermin by the gunmen who get a bit wild when they drink. Fonda does not really approve of what they do but is reluctant to come down on them too hard for fear of alienating them. That means that it is up to the sheriff to keep order.    Keeping order is a hard job. He is not trained and he is certainly no gunfighter. He is just a farmer. The townspeople encourage him just to ignore things in the hope that the bad guys will eventually go away. All are frightened. When a friend is lynched, though, Stewart decides that enough is enough and takes on the whole gang.    This is one of those films in which the little guy manages to stand up to the bully, survive and even win. It comes at a cost, though.",

The first thing I thought after it was over was \"man, that was miles better than Black Sunday.\" It's still not worth rewatching, but if you've steered clear of Bava after watching the borefest that was Black Sunday, this may entice you to at least give him another try.    The plot, what little of it there is, is this; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake (the bay of the title). Her daughter stages a suicide, so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves. A bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident. Complications ensue.    It's hopelessly entangled in its own plot, despite that plot not being in any way complex. It throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity (but some, at least, courtesy the lovely softcore actress Brigitte Skay), foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come. Basically, it's mindless fun. Dario Argento did it far better a few years later with Profondo Rosso; see that instead. *",

For you young'uns, Pauline Kael was a powerful, maverick movie critic who, aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer, often went against the grain of your Rex Reeds and Roger Eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human. And smart as hell.    This movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever, beautiful and enlightening.  I could not find one less-than-amazed review at Rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better. But friend, think about it just a little bit, how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds -  friggin' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less!   And the protagonist's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot, working at a fast food joint (with a cliched smiley face logo), driving a hot cherry-red Pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old (which is a crime in the US, ja? no?).    Kevin Spacey's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful.  Annette Bening, given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned, in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale.      Another Amazon reviewer cited Ray Lawrence's Austrailian film from 1987, BLISS as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for American Beauty.  Having seen BLISS several times, and being a huge fan of that movie, I think he is correct.  Written by Alan Ball, a TV sitcom writer, this film pushes a screwed-up message.  It entertains, that is if your brain is on stand-by.  I wish Pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision",

            "input": "Loose Cannon . The documentary was really, really good.  They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense.  One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day.  Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr's Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s!     I don't know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing.  Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun.      They really played up the Flyin' Brian stuff as being ahead of it's time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing.  Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn't really long-lasting if you think about it.  The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill.     The accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not.  He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him.     Anyhoo, the official coroner's report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over.  I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) \"sports entertainer\" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job.  It's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale.  The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in.     Best parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff.  I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars.  Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW.  They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee.  I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too.  They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993.  Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick.  They were so hilarious together.     Another great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF.  That was sad stuff.  JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal.     Overall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5.  I haven't watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries.",

            "input": "Ah, to be twentysomething in Seattle in the early 1990s! . This film genuinely surprised me when I first saw it in theaters in 1992.  For me, Bridget Fonda was the main draw at the time, as she received top billing and was on the movie posters with Matt Dillion.  It felt like a bait and switch, because the film focuses more on Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick's relationship, even though they aren't featured on the poster.  That's no biggie, because I enjoyed their storyline much more than Bridget and Matt's...but I bet Campbell and Kyra weren't happy to be excluded on the poster/DVD cover.    This film has it all...great music suitable to the period (grunge/alternative), fantastic use of place (Seattle in a starring role), interesting and quirky characters, and true to life portrayal of young people in their twenties negotiating through life as they find their true passions.  I especially loved Campbell Scott's performance and he is the true star of this film.  His job is working on creating a \"Super Train\" to get Seattlites out of their cars and onboard for their commute, because he believes that \"if you give them great coffee and great music, they'll ride.\"  His girlfriend, played by Kyra Sedgwick, has her pulse on the masses, by telling him, \"I still love my car, though.\"  She's an environmentalist who drives an old gass guzzling clunker of an automobile, which Campbell pokes fun at after a lunch date.  Its a joy to watch their relationship grow from initial doubts to lover games about how soon after a date one should call to other challenges that crop up.  I especially love the scene when Linda (Sedgwick) peruses Steve's (Campbell Scott) record albums and gets nostalgic about her college days.  That scene epitomizes the exciting \"getting to know you\" stage of dating and rings absolutely true.  The choice of music in that scene, and throughout the entire movie really enhances the scenes overall.    Probably the only thing I didn't like about the film, which is just a tiny critique, was Janet's (Fonda) almost groupie-like infatuation with Cliff (Dillon), who didn't seem all that interested in her (until she moves on with her life).  They are a mismatched pair if there ever was one...Janet with her ambitions for Grad School to pursue architecture, and Cliff the stereotypical Gen X slacker working menial jobs to support his rock band career that probably wouldn't have gone anywhere.  Janet should have hooked up with the plastic surgeon who doesn't know how to have fun!    This dvd would be made even better with a director's commentary track.  Cameron Crowe could divulge a lot of interesting information and insite jokes that the average filmwatcher might not catch (like when the mime says, \"wooo woooo woooo\" in response to a guy who says he works for Boeing, or when a reporter asks Cliff what the song \"Touch Me, I'm Dick\" is about--which is an inside joke on the actual song \"Touch Me, I'm Sick\").  This film is so ingrained into the grunge culture of Seattle of the early 1990s, that future audiences could use a lot of background info a director's commentary would provide.  At any rate, this film is a joy to watch, and cheaply priced that it's worth having in one's collection.  And buy the soundtrack while you're at it",

It almost seems like a Saturday Morning Cartoon with violence and unnecessary rape suggested scenes.    Another thing that really bugs me is the fact that the evil King Hamdo is such a whiny coward, but yet somehow manages to recieve complete obedience from all his subjects.  Somebody would have dethroned him by now, in fact there was an assassination attempt where the two assassins were skilled enough to sneak all the way into his chambers with out being noticed, kill his guards, have him in there sights, and not only miss him, but stand out in the open only to be shot by his scared shaky hand from under his desk.

A wonderfully directed and filmed Faustian story, quintessentially American in tone, both its content and style were remarkable for those times, over 60 years ago.  It is played with a light touch despite it's deep and atmospheric(and marvelous) cinematography by Joseph August and it's often moody score by Bernard Herrmann.    Of course one wonders if the film would have the same buoyancy and sense of fun, despite the dark themes, if any actor played Mr. Scratch other than the truly wonderful Walter Huston.  He is simply terrific here, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission.  Countering Huston's sly, mischievous, grinning Devil is another great character actor with the gravitas to match him, and that's Edward Arnold as Daniel Webster.    I like the opening credits wherein director Dieterle lists all the behind the scenes talent without titles, including himself, and at the end states \" who collaborated on this film\".  It is truly a collaboration with director and cinematographer and composer and editor (Robert Wise) all on the same page.  It has some striking moments, most especially the first encounter with Belle (Simone Simon), the ghostly dance at Jabez Stone's mansion, and the final eerie trial.      The supporting performances, especially the always reliable Jane Darwell as Ma Stone are fine.  James Craig as Jabez Stone was a bit of a stiff, but the movie's overall qualities compensate for him.  Simone Simon is luscious, and the honestly presented depiction of her adulterous relationship with Jabez is quite daring for the times (one wonders how it got past the Hays office).    This came out in 1941, and Arnold's stirring defense of Jabez  that exhalts all things American in the land and character of it's people may strike some as corny, but this was made on the cusp of World War II, and these things needed to be said then, and in a lower key, some of which wouldn't hurt us to be reminded of now.    And, finally, there is the last great shot of Huston's Scratch eating the stolen peach pie and then musingly rubbing his chin as he looks out directly at us in search of his next victim. Perfect.",

What you have here is a movie that was constructed in the mold of the original \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" where you have some unsuspecting people coming up on a crazed homicidal family.  Unfortunately, the family really comes off looking goofy and silly more than dangerous and deadly.  I would certainly rather come upon Ma and Pa's family than Leatherface and his family if you know what I mean.  \"American Gothic\" does a decent job of painting a crazy family portrait for sure, but Ma, Pa and company just do not exactly strike fear in the viewer's heart...they just are not that formidable as far as their prowess as horror movie villains.  The kills are not too bad, but certainly are not anything to write home about.  The acting is okay and production values are not too bad for a movie of this nature.  I just did not like the way that Ma and Pa's family came across to the viewer...they come across more weird than horrifying, more eccentric than anything else and not exactly dangerous.  Don't get me wrong...obviously, they killed some people, but I was not convinced in the manner in which this was done or in the family's disposition as brutal killers.  Also, I felt that the ending was rather weak and very predictable.  I guess they just do not make them like they used to anymore.  In short, the way I look at \"American Gothic\" is that if the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is a FIVE STARS horror movie, then this movie, comparatively speaking, is certainly worth no more than ONE STAR...it is what it is folks!",

There is a quality to Miyazaki's animation and story-telling that is indescribable. You have to experience it to understand it. The attention to detail and the intimacy in his narration is really special. Though it's probably easier (for English speakers) to watch the movie with the English dialogue, it's so much better with the original Japanese soundtrack. The English dialogue lacks the softness and subtlety of the Japanese version. This is a great family film; a film people of all ages can enjoy.

Meanwhile, many of the crew members are committing suicide, and Cain is investigating.  (Excited yet?).  Of course, it all culminates in a kind of underwater HIGH NOON when the bad guy who promised to come back, does so with two other goons, and chase Cain around the plant for a while.

Did they perhaps believe that depicting a troop of black soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering the boy's family wouldn't be as politically correct (or as comprehensible to a pre-teen or early teen audience) as showing a greedy white mining agent ruthlessly slaughtering the boy's family? Of course, Francois Joubert simply has to be transformed into the obnoxious Harry Winslow (to make the movie more appealing to an American audience). And must every story involving young people of opposite sexes be turned into a \"Girls are stupid! - Boys are stupider! - I love you! - I love you too!\" tale of teenage battle of the sexes turned to love? It's been many years since I read the novels, but I don't remember that particular twist to the story, perhaps because Van der Post wasn't necessarily writing for the 11-14-year-old American market.

Second of all the box art gives the whole movie away. being reason I say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo. I know it might not be a big deal to some people but when I first rented this movie, I was so curious about what CUJO was, The box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this. Well I know people are going to say, READ THE BOOK DUMMY and you will know. Well I am not a book reader but I was so excited to know what kind of killer was CUJO and was a dog, I kinda had a hunch though. This movie is fantastic. One of those kinds that you could just sit there and feel that everything on the show was really actually happening and not just acting. That is a good movie! One last thing.

Hey! Might as well have the best!   The story is straightforward and stupid: a car crash decapitates the fiancee, so of course the only rational response to this predicament is to keep her head alive in a box in the basement. Why couldn't he keep her body alive, too, then just stitch them back together? Well, the scientist boyfriend must have lost his head because he didn't think about this course of action. Or many he was thinking with his little head and seized the opportunity to create a more bodilicious girlfriend with some cut and paste action!  Anyway, the girlfriend gets jealous...watch out for a woman scorned! \"No baby, it's not like that. I was at the strip club looking for new bodies for you!\" Yeah right try that out around MY house and see what happens.

Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!    This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.    This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. \"But just how 'black' is he?,\" you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:    1. He talks different from the whites. (\"Hey Bodee.\" \"His name's Bodhi!\" \"Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine.\" Or something to that effect.)    2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)    3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)    4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)    I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.      The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.    This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.     Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. \"Sphere of longiness\"? Ech!    I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the \"I love the 80's\" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.    And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.    I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, \"Prayer of the Rollerboys\" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.    Buy something else. ANYTHING else.

I didn't remember the plot, but I remembered the scenery and the music and the cool biplanes and dogfights.    So, I finally bought this movie so I could watch it as an adult.    I can empathize with those who say this movie is too long and moves too slowly.  That said, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.    The airplanes are amazing.  Where did they get all these biplanes from?  The only other movie I've seen that has such authentic looking biplane dogfights is \"Wings\", and that was made back in the 1920's when biplanes were all over the place.    The soundtrack by Jerry Goldmith fits the movie perfectly and adds mood where appropriate.    I loved the \"intermission\".   It reminded me of a time when a movie was a real event.  Movies were so long that the movie itself gave you a break to use the bathroom.  I saw this movie in a theater that was designed to allow perhaps a thousand people to watch a single movie on a huge screen, not some modern \"plex\" theater that has twelve little rooms where you can pay to see a movie with a bunch of strangers a few months before it's out on DVD.    So, it moves a little slowly by today's standards, but it's epic, and it's interesting to watch Peppard's character slowly alienate himself from his squadron, and his lover, so that at the end they kill him off by giving him the \"privelege\" of flying an experimental aircraft.",

The subject matter of this film is important for many reasons and is equally full of dramatic potential - this movie makes the most of both.  The screenplay is constructed like a Beethoven symphony - logical, constantly moving forward, boiling with energy.  The script, presumably, is based on the original transcript of the conference.  The acting - well - how can one praise it enough?  The human drama - the constant interplay of personal politics, intellectual fencing, bestial attitudes and genuine emotional reactions to the subject matter being discussed - it's captivating from first to last.  And the last scenes are superbly poignant - the final intimate focus on both Heydrich and Eichmann as shallow men and profound monsters, the use of Schubert (as both reference and musical score) to underline the moral desolation and irony at hand, the final roll call to enumerate the sober injustice of the participants' ultimate fate.    This is yet another HBO movie which raises the bar for American cinema, proving that one can still make a great statment on film without either large budgets or avant garde methods.  I can watch this over and over and always get something new out of the experience - which, of course, is the very best recommendation for actually purchasing a movie on DVD.

But, unless someone is well versed in the Bible, or the Torah, the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment. It jumps to the main story for a few minutes, then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs, but it's still not clear what is going on.    The description says Hadassah hid her religion, but it's not as hidden as you'd think it would be.  Over and over again, she and her uncle talk about being Jews, the housekeeper calls them Jews, their friends call them Jews, and there are even more flashbacks to Hadassah's childhood showing how she grew up Jewish.  She even reads from a scroll of a Biblical tale to children in the market.  If this is how she hides her religion, I'd hate to see what she'd do to flaunt it.    Actress Tiffany Dupont tries to give Hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world.  She's a teenager longing to explore her roots, and the world at large.  This would go well in having teens relate to her, but the dialog gets in the way.  The writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the Bible.  The complex dialog is spewed out, sometimes as quickly as possible, without any real inflection.  This causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable.  And, unfortunately, even the more seasoned  actors stumble over the formalized wording, further distancing the viewer from the story.       If you're really into Biblical stories, then maybe you'd enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic, it's best to look elsewhere.

I never cared for the Elfego Baca story, I had been known to go to my room and VOLUNTARILY do my homework on Sunday nights when these episodes played, but I would have GLADLY paid the price for this set if it had included ALL of the \"Swamp Fox\" episodes!  Above and beyond the fact that I am proud to have Francis Marion as a distant relative, and that I hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the Revolutionary War, who, with his compatriots, probably contributed as much as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or any of the other Founding Fathers to win us our freedom, I really loved this story just for itself!  Not only have I decided NOT to waste my money on this incomplete set, I have even gone as far as removing it from my \"Wish List\" to save the funds of my family and friends, as well!

The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility.  This film  is too jolly and innocent.  Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.    I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.  Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it.

            "input": "Over the shoulder boulder holders . I will cry at anything it seems, My Girl & Armageddon floor me everytime, and I sometimes even cry at Neighbours. So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.    It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.    In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.    It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.    Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.    The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. \"Over the shoulder boulder holders\" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.    I've heard \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" the same again.    Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.    I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo",

Larry Clark reminds me of a lot     Let's take a look at his pathetic resume shall we:    *Kids-Yes another soft porn film involving Kids.    *Bully- This movie should be when \"White Trash attacks\".  Bully featured mundane acting, the most UNLIKABLE characters  ever to put on screen, stupid characters, a \"twist\" that  aint really a twist, awful camera shots and angle and  a \"gay bull\". Nuff said.    *Teenage Caveman-Subpar sci-film.    Now we get to Ken Park, probably the most revolting   story of Clark's kids trilogy if you will.    These kids special? Please give me a break. I don't  call killing your neighbors or grandparents, special.    Doing drugs makes you special? Funny I thought that made  you a druggie and a loser.    There is no smoothness or observation or anaylsis of  the kids from any sort of rhetorical view. Anyone who  who seeks to compare this to classic shows like Family  Ties, or My So Called Life isn't fooling anyone.    One key difference, the kids in so called life, knew they  were troubled, lost and asked for help. The teens in \"Ken Park\"  could give a crap if they live or die, their days are spent  on drug binges, fornicating with the friends and in some  cases, their friend's mother.      Really it doesn't get anymore revoling that Larry Clark.    None of the characters in the movie can be considered,  weak, inept, pathetic, loony comes to mind but far  from being strong.    Softcore and hardcore pornograpy seem to be what the filmmaking  is echoing nothing else, the other reviews even the most  positive ones can ignore that.    There is no reality with these kids, they live in their  violent world and heaven forbid if you try to take them  out of it.    Clark is not anybody's master of art, if you're art is  hardcore pornography, mixed in with convulted storyline  , with no rolemodels, no point and weak characters then  people need to pick up a dictionary or read actual  definitions of art.    The movie is nothing more than tour de force of obscene garbage  that should be flushed down the toilet.    Seeing at the reception Clark has received over the year,  it's great that fans are starting to see what he really  is just a perverted old man , nothing else.    Even then his movies make him look even more pathetic.",

However, despite its lack-luster performance, the film did serve a purpose in the classroom.    True, the film leaves something to be desired. They change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them.  Editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story.  Rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely.  Major events in the rising action are left out, thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing.  Overall, very few of my students liked the film adaptation of Jane Yolen's novel, which they found so riveting.    On a brighter side, because of so many differences, viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through T-Charts and Venn diagrams.  It also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills.

City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals.

            "input": "On the Edge of the Abyss . For thirteen tense days in October, 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  The Soviets had placed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.  These missiles were capable of striking much of the United States and Latin America.  Alerted to the presence of the missiles by a U-2 spy plane photograph, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) and the joint chiefs of staff begin to chart a course to avoid a catastrophic nuclear war.    The movie is told through the eyes of Presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner).  Aside from Costner's obviously fake Bostonian accent, the design works quite well.  By telling the story through O'Donnell's eyes, it allows the viewer to focus more on JFK, RFK, and the development of the crisis.      Directed by Costner as well, the movie describes the entire crisis, from start to finish. From the first discovery of the missiles by the U-2, through the agonizingly long two weeks of decisions and negotiations, to the final outcome, this movie covers all the bases.  I do wish that more attention would have been paid to the Soviet side of the crisis.  I believe that the film would have been more complete had this occurred.    The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Bruce Greenwood gives a compelling and exciting performance as John F. Kennedy, while Steven Culp is equally as good as JFK's younger brother Bobby.  Costner himself is again at his best as O'Donnell, and Michael Fairman does a wonderful job as the embattled Adlai Stevenson, who stands up to the Soviets at the U.N. with his famous \"hell freezes over\" quote.    I give this movie my highest recommendation. October, 1962 was a tense time for the world, and this great movie does a fine job of depicting the missile crisis.  As with its earlier predecessor \"The Missiles of October\", this film describes exactly how close the world came to nuclear war.",

I wasn't really expecting much, pretty much just another slapstick, stupid comedy. But to be totally honest, this movie is really awesome! \"Hotshots,\" ought to have you rolling around the floor in some instances. But first, a look at the \"storyline.\"    Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the son of a famous air ace who died um...tragically in an F-15 crash landing and a terrible mix-up regarding moose hunting season. He decides to follow in his father's footsteps and become a flying wonder. This briefly sums up the main \"story,\" but there are many other smaller stories including that of Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) and Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) who fights his own personal war against the terrible ailment of Wall Eye Vision. That aside, Topper Harley must find out what really happened to his dad and help both his friends and himself to achieve their dreams, even if it goes to ridiculous proportions.    You may think that this is a movie that merely takes the piss out of movies like \"Top Gun,\" \"Full Metal Jacket,\" and \"Kickboxer,\" but...well, you're right. But the satire is clever (yet decidedly idiotic), and it certainly succeeds in making just about everything totally ridiculous. Don't expect realism, objectivenes and logic in this movie - that's not the point of it. It's there as a satire, and really is a classic satirical film of the 1990's. The appeal of \"Hotshots\" is the sheer stupidity and absurdity of many of the events that take place in the movie, and of course, if you've watched the movies that are being ripped off, you'll really laugh your head off.    The best character has to be Adm. Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges). He performs the role of a supposedly \"hardened\" war-veteran and a man who has seen much conflict with great gusto. It just goes to show that some vets get more violent, others more angry, some sad - and Benson just gets dumber. He's even better in the sequel, which is surprisingly better than the original (Hence the reason why this only gets 4.5 stars.)    All in all, \"Hotshots,\" is a moronic, silly, yet extremely funny and witty slapstick comedy. If you like Monty Python style humour or just love classic slapstick, this movie is undoubtedly for you. Otherwise, if you like intelligent comedy, stay the hell away from \"Hotshots.\" It's not meant to be intelligent, so remember that. But at the end of it all, it'll always be a classic slapstick, silly comedy! Buy it, rent it, steal it today",

Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.

I can enjoy \"B\" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.

As horse-trainer or dog-owner, as spurned wife or mistress, Liz is a female who is absorbed in the giving and receiving of love: devotion to the object of passion is the center of her life... Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity...

Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, called her a child who 'lights up with the integrity of a great passion.'     Directed by Clarence Brown with loving attention to detail, the movie that made her a star is a big bestseller from another era set in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a butcher's daughter, teams with a vagabond teenager named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) to train for competition a horse she's won in a raffle...     From the coastal plains with its beaches, to the rolling hills, thatched cottages, and miles of country walks, \"National Velvet\" is the product of a bygone era in movie-making...     Following closely the structure of the popular Enid Bagnold novel, the movie is part horse story, part family portrait: scenes of training and riding are balanced by cozy family scenes, vignettes about young love and sermons from Mom on the virtues of courage and endurance...    The Browns are a noble version of Hollywood rustic... Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they live quiet, exemplary lives... Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of plain-folk wisdom; the spokeswoman for common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her horse-crazy daughter, and she lets the girl have her dream...    Anne Revere won an Oscar as Velvet's mother, as did editor Robert J. Kern...",

Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie",

The story begins with the Doctor and Peri arriving on Necros, mourning the death of an old friend. Little do the time travellers know that word of their friend's demise is a clever ruse to lure the Doctor into an encounter with some very old enemies.   For on Necros, everything is run by the Great Healer, who is making a fortune with his galactic funeral parlor and some rather sinister side business ventures. Clive Swift of Keeping up Appearances fame (known to fans of that british comedy  as Richard Bucket) appears as Mr Jobel, Caretaker of the funeral parlor, Tranquil Rose, who naturally takes a more than passing interest in young Peri.   But it is the Doctor who gets into the main action when a business partner of the Healer plots against him by hiring a well known assassin of the Grand Order to do  him in. The Doctor quickly learns the Healer is in reality his long running nemesis, Davros. Davros is using the bodies of the dead to further his new race of Daleks loyal to him alone.   But more than one betrayal awaits our heroes, and the Doctor is brought before Davros one more time, as Daleks begin desposing of those who are a threat to Davros'  cunning plans.     Want to know what happens between the Doctor, Davros and the Daleks? Order Doctor Who-Revelation of the Daleks when it comes out on DVD. This is one Doctor Who adventure you won't want to miss!",

I was impressed with the wit and comic timing of the actors, and the subtle comedy which didn't hit you over the head to make a point.  When they came on the market in VHS format, I decided to buy them in installments, and am very happy I did.      You likely know the story: Richard Briers plays Tom Good, a frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works for a plastics company.  Good and his wife Barabara (Felicity Kendall) decide to \"get back to basics\" and thereby Tom quits his job, turns the yard into a huge garden, buys chickens and pigs for livestock and decides to become self sufficient, bartering for only what they need, etc.  Not a practical life style for 1970s suburban London.  Contrasting are their neighbors: Jerry and Margo Ledbetter, played by Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith. Mr. Ledbetter is an executive in the plastics company Tom Good used to work for;  he crawls and grovels to the boss to keep his high paying job, which supports his expensive and well furnished home.  Ledbetter is a slave to his work despite finanicial prosperity;  Good doesn't answer to a boss or schedule, but faces obstacle after obstacle with his crops or livestock.    The chemistry and comic timing between all 4 principal actors is very fine, and the laughs are many and frequent.  Despite the impractical plot - no one would get away with having livestock in a subdivision anywhere in the civilized world for long - this makes for wholesome entertainment.  I haven't seen the DVD version for comparison, but the VHS tapes are very good quality: clear picture, great camera work.",

Paul Newman is great as a despairing, alcoholic \"David\", once second in his law class, once part of a prestigious law firm, once married...till he dared to stand up to his dishonest law firm owner/and father-in-law who wanted to fix a jury.    The above is past history...just mentioned in the film.    It is some years after, and alcoholic Newman, with only 4 cases in the last few years,   ...has an epiphany...where his youthful religious and ethical training reawakens  as he gets the picture, so to speak, of a woman treated unjustly, whom he can help.    He forgets himself and his troubles, and the people who have pushed him around,     ...and starts fighting for the brain damaged young woman...against the hospital and doctors who damaged her. He will later awaken the conscience (as the movie hints) of one of the \"Goliaths\" he goes up against.     However, there are pitfalls... as opposing lawyer Concannon is not above using any trick---or person...to destroy the case.     Paul Newman's epiphany scene (which I won't describe further to spoil it for you, but which is clearly recognizable) is quite moving.        His Goliaths include:  The biased, hostile Judge, the \"Prince of Darkness\" superlawyer Concannon (played well by James Mason, always good at suave villians), the doctors and **most** of the attending support staff who attended the unfortunate Deborah Ann Kaye,   ...and the somewhat hesitant Bishop Brophy, head of St. Catherine's, the hospital where Mrs. Kaye lost her baby and suffered massive brain damage.     Set in Boston, a largely Catholic city (I am told) we here have nominal Catholics pitted against those of their denomination who take the Christian \"Good Samaritan\" story seriously.      My family caution:  There are some cuss words and a brief suggestion of a bedroom scene.       The Verdict implies the barely seen 12 who also are key players...the jury, who must deliver the verdict.      Will they go with the letter of the law?  Or---its spirit? (If you are familiar with this phrase from the Christian faith, you have the answer...)    (Hint of spoiler below)      My wish is that brain injured Terri Schiavo had had a jury   who could see the spirit of the law!      Instead we had lots of judges fighting turf wars against a Congress that dared   (how DARE they question the unquestionable judges seemed to be the attitude)    to merely ask for a second look at the whole case.

Here's a memorable Oscar-winning performance from one of Hollywood's finest actor's, Ronald Colman, in a story of jealousy, madness and revenge.  In a role that was originally intended for Cary Grant, Colman is excellent as Anthony John, a celebrated off-Broadway actor who blurs the line between his character, Othello, and reality when he starts acting on the murderous impulses of his character.  As a psychological melodrama, \"A Double Life\" undoubtedly stands out as a success.     George Kukor's direction is exemplary as he successfully juxtaposes Tony John's real jealousy over his ex-wife's relationship with Edmond O'Brien, while mirroring the wracked emotions and madness of Shakespeare's protagonist.     Colman convincingly protrays Tony John's progressive dementia from the get-go the minute he is offered the part soon after the opening credits roll. For an actor used to playing debonair and  swashbuckling heroes in the 30's this role must have been a challenge for Colman, but a welcome one.  He brings a nervous intensity to the character of Tony John that is never melodramatic but is realistically portrayed.     Co-written by the talented actress, Ruth Gordon (Harold & Maude), \"A Double Life\" showcases an impressive cast including Shelley Winters (in her first professional role), Ray Collins, and Signe Hasso.     The score by Miklos Rozsa, as well as the screenplay by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, are both as memorable as the performances in this remarkable film. This DVD's transfer is markedly clean and lovingly restored from the original film negative and presented in the original 1.33:1 format in which the the film was initially shot.",

Rick does an unbelievable job in this movie and proves himself to be a true actor worthy of extreme praise.  The story line is excellent and true to the actual event the movie is based upon.  They spent the time and got all the details right on this one, the historical accuracy is extremely impressive.  This is not a \"chick flick\" as it has a lot of intense close quarter combat, which is not the case with many modern WWII films.  That makes some parts of the movie a bit graphic and nasty, but WWI was graphic and nasty.  The hand-held camera work is a bit jumpy and almost too over-the-top in trying to place you \"into\" the action at times, but the movie is certainly good enough to overcome the overzealous camera work.  If you want to know something of WWI combat, there's not a better movie out there right now - at least that I know of.  With all due respect to \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" of course - both versions. The Lost Batallion should be in any military enthusiast's collection.",

I have epals that I share my favs with and visa-versa.  The \"Touching Evil\" series was recommended by an epal because of it's intelligent drama.  I rented it, for the lowest price, of course, just in case it wasn't worth the cash.  I really liked it.    I do have my favorite episodes, though.  The first episode, \"The Lost Boys\" of the series and the first episode in Series 3.  Series 2 and 3 do not have specific episode titles, so I call this one, \"Hearts\".    \"The Lost Boys\" introduces Detective Inspector Dave Creegan(Robson Green) to us.  Creegan is volitile, yet brilliant.  He had been wounded in the line of duty, which was followed by psychiatric counselling.  It makes one wonder why ACC Enwright(Michael Feast) called him back into service.  Creegan's emotional volitility caused the breakup of his marriage.    After getting to know Creegan as a character, the audience can see why.  Creegan is a \"driven\" man and has instincts that can see through the mask of a criminal as he does in \"The Lost Boys\". Creegan sees through the mask of university professor Ronald Hinks(Ian McDiarmid-Sen. Palatine from Star Wars).  Creegan fights with Enwright and other team members to get Hinks arrested for kidnapping 3 boys, but Hink's lawyers have a larger case for Creegan's harrassment of Hinks.    Creegan is teamed up with DI Susan Taylor(Nicola Walker), Detective Sargent Jonathan Kreitman(Adam Kotz) and Detective Constable Mark Rivers(Shaun Dingwall).  There is conflict almost immediately between the team members.    I would like to see a 4th \"Touching Evil\" series, if only to clean up some questions before ending this intelligent series.  My biggest question, of course, is \"Why did Enwright bring Creegan back in the first place?\"  Creegan made it clear that he was a \"one-to-one\" person and that selling ice cream would probably be the best job he would enjoy AND he was psychologically unstable.  There is also the question of why Taylor was picked to partner with Creegan.    \"Hearts\" is just plain brilliant.  All the actors are at their best in this one, but Robson Green stands out.  After the murder of a friend, he finally crosses that psychological line.  Green is brilliant followed by Andy Serkis(Dr. Michael Lawler).  The other actors follow closely behind.    Do I recommend this series.  YES, but only the British one.  When we Americans try to recreate a wonderful program like this, we always fall short",

No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two \"hipper\" more \"kid-friendly\" replacements that serve the same function.

There is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary: It is well presented with great CGIs, narration and overall structure - hence it is worth at least two stars (whatever this stars rating business means).    The problem is the substance: it is simply not there. Menzies is one of those pseudo-scientists (as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents) that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it.    I think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence. Menzies, starts off with his conclusion (rather than ending with it) and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it. When all alleged evidence is demolished, he arrogantly states that he will not budge, \"one millimetre\" as he puts it, from his theory and that, in time, everyone will accept it as a fact that the Chinese were the first to discover America.    A true scientist, even in the presence of evidence substantiating his/her viewpoint, always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future. Menzies does exactly the opposite: with no evidence on his side, he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong.    It saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea, Menzies - not a scientist but, at best, a qualified mariner - managed to make a buck on his book and that PBS, helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him. The feeling one gets at the end, is that PBS ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap's air-ology.    Whilst visually pleasing, this PBS production is in substance a waste of time to watch, as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer",

Butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of Dracula not seen since Frank Langella's campy 1970s performance. If you're not in love with him already, you will be after watching the DVD extras. His interviews are charming and fun. Though watching his audition reel, where he tried to emote wearing full \"Atilla\" hair and make-up, was sort of uncomfortable.

But, it is typical for a Van Damme flick. Horrible acting, over-produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it, non-existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending. I have to admit though, that I have most of Van Damme's movies. He is a decent Martial Artist. In my opinion his best movies are \"Kickboxer\" and \"Bloodsport\". These are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring. I have a few observations / comments / questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned Van Damme fan: Isn't it funny that with all his millions of dollars that Van Damme can't find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead... Why must every character Van Damme plays speak with a French accent? He tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from France. Isn't this preposterous? You'd think if Van Damme was serious about his \"acting\" career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw. I mean, it's not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles... Why does Van Damme always have to show his bare rear-end so much? Does he think WOMEN are watching his silly movies? You'd think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so WHY SHOW IT? ... Is it me or does Van Damme need a good hair stylist? His hair is especially stupid in CYBORG. He looks like he should be in the cast for \"Revenge of the Nerds\"... Speaking of style, was it Van Damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated Dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt 80's look? If so, for this deed alone he should be reprimanded... Why was Van Damme such a huge action hero? He is so friggin' short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store I don't think he would look all that intimidating. At least Steven Seagal is tall and tough looking although Van Damme is definitely in better shape. You never see Seagal showing his muscles.... Lastly, even though I can laugh about Van Damme I am definitely a fan. That being said, I wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers, directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films. I think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work. Van Damme has alot of heart, maybe not so much as Stallone, but more heart than most action heroes like Shwarzenegger, etc. The people involved with most of Van Damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere. They should have taken pride in their work. It's not like they weren't paid handsomely for their services",

The only thing was, the documentary was kind of short - like 1 hour and 10 minutes. But it was good. Here are some highlights:    - When the Russians invaded Afghanistan, the U.S. press gave sharp criticism to the Russians. However, since the U.S. press has a U.S. audience why doesn't the press tell Americans what is happening with their tax dollars and what they can do to fix their mistakes. An example at this time was U.S. funding for death squads in El Salvador and Indonesian funding for the massacre of Timorese. It is cowardly for our criticisms of Russians, when we as Americans have no control over them, but we do have control over what we do and ourselves.    - The media was most free during the mid nineteenth century, this was before media started getting advertising in it. Once advertising started to happen, media could not say certain things the advertisers did not like.    - Run up budget deficits by giving massive tax cuts that benefit the wealthy, then cut social programs.  Then eventually get rid of Social Security and public education.  Getting rid of public education and Social Security just eliminates solidarity and sympathy with others.      - If your pension is tied up in stocks - stocks go up when people lose their jobs, that is against your own interests and all worker's interests.    This Chomsky documentary was more entertaining than the previous made ones. If a person does not pay attention to foreign policy, they can still grasp the concepts and ideas that are presented in this documentary. This documentary provides plenty of ammo to help people think and get active. Watch it and have house parties or let a bunch of politically passive friends watch it.",

You may ask yourself immediately into The Black Dahlia, why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match, that goes on for several minutes, between two L.A. police officers. What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh. Director Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film, and the cast, for the most part, are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations, even when you can't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information. I was never bored for a moment, the film is that sensually stylized, but it is finally grossly unsatisfying, like a Playboy magazine without a centerfold, or indeed, an unsolved murder.",

A Few Good Men is on my (and my wife's) list of Top Ten movies of all time....with plenty of good reasons. As it has been said in many other reviews, the acting in this film (from all the supporting actors as well) is excellent. The story is good too....very interesting, actually. It would be easy to look at this movie as simply a \"blockbuster\" kind of movie....which, essentially, it is. It's got A-list talent in front of, and behind the camera....it made a hell of alot of money at the box office, so yes it's a \"blockbuster\". But it's also a damn good story, as  mentioned before. Another thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's characters....something most other films on this scale would have done. And I know it's been said in many other reviews, but I'm going to say it again anyway....Jack Nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie. No, not because of that famous \"You can't handle the truth....\" line. But because his acting really is that good. It seems so natural. His mannerisms are so natural, that he could pass for a real life military leader....I am in the military myself, so I can vouch for this. And even though this movie is over two hours, I was never once bored....you won't be either",

            "input": "The ties that bind--and break. . Roger Michell's \"The Mother\" ranks with \"Cries and Whispers\" and \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" as one of the most unpleasant, profoundly disturbing portraits of a dysfunctional family ever put on film. It is also undeniably brilliant at showing the frayed knots of family loyalty that only need one good shock to break irrevocably. Hanif Kureishi--an old hand at making audiences squirm--tells the story of May (Anne Reid), a sixtyish housewife in a semi-rural English town, visiting her children in London with her husband Toots (Peter Vaughan). Ten minutes into the movie, Toots dies, leaving May totally at a loss. As the film makes plain from the beginning, May's life has revolved entirely for decades around caring for Toots. At first we think the film will be a poignant study of a woman's grief. May doesn't want to go back to her empty house, but her children plainly don't want her around: her son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) is a cold, self-centered businessman, and her daughter Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a needy, whining neurotic who blames her mother for nearly everything that's gone wrong with her life. We think the story will be about May's learning to stand up for herself and make a new life. (When Bobby asks May not to be difficult, she stiffens and asks, \"Why shouldn't I be difficult?\") But then May meets Darren (Daniel Craig), Paula's sexy, moody boyfriend and a man half May's age, and from then on all expectations fly straight out the window and land with a crash. I wish the publicity for the film didn't reveal what happens between May and Darren, but even so the impact of it assaults the audience like the punch in the face Paula eventually gives May. If the movie were just about an elderly woman's sexuality, it wouldn't be so shocking; what shocks is May's selfish betrayal of Paula, and the brutal fashion in which Paula discovers it. At that moment we lose all our moorings as an audience, and have no idea who among the characters to side with, if anyone. We still have sympathy for May--as we don't for the patently hateful Paula, Darren and Bobby--but we also gasp in horror at her heedless behavior, and get an idea why her children turned out the way they did. \"The Mother\" is hard to sit through, and also hard to forget.",

From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with  consentual desire already.

Many films have featured groups of social misfits who have grown and changed through the assistance of a caring teacher, but in how many of those films has the teacher been dead for almost 400 years?  Danny Devito is funny in this family-friendly film, but it is the Bard himself who shines best here.    I use this film in my college-level Shakespeare courses and find that it is more useful for teaching Shakespeare to young adults than most of the recent film adaptations aimed at the younger generation (_She's the Man_ and _10 Things I Hate About You_ come to mind).  _Renaissance Man_ celebrates the magic of Shakespeare that even recent films preserving Shakespeare's language, such as the _Hamlet_ starring Ethan Hawke, do not.  In _Renaissance Man_, Shakespeare's beautiful language is not replaced.  Rather, it is read and then internalized by the characters who produce their own modernized version in the form of a rap song and chant.  The film teaches about some of Shakespeare's rhetorical strategies (e.g., metaphor, oxymoron) as well as his themes (e.g., mutability).  While the recitation of Henry the Fifth's famous \"Crispin Day\" speech at the end of the film is a little sappy, the characters' reaction to and obvious enjoyment of the _Henry V_ stage production is not.  The characters in _Renaissance Man_ model for the young people of today how Shakespeare should be experienced.",

It is the middle of another Ice Age. There is an introduction and four episodes. Every other disc has four episodes.     Episode 1: Return of the Ice  Shagrats stuggle to survive as they are stalked by hungry Snowstalkers. The Shagrat looks like a cross between a capybara and a lemming. The snowstalker is a white cat with sabre-tooth like fangs.    Episode 2: The Vanished Sea  The bottom of Europe and the tip of Africa has come together, blocking off the Mediterrainean from the Atlantic Ocean. This has caused all the water to evaporate, only leaving a salt flat.On this salt flat lives a family of cryptiles, lizard-like animals that run on two legs. Islands, have become small patches of land covered with crevases. On the crevases, lives the scrofa, a pig-like animal that is in constant danger.    Episode 3: Praries of the Amizonia  The amazon rainforest has died out and become a vast plain. On these plains, Karakillers hunt in groups to track down the Babookaris. Also, the rattleback has evolved from various marsupiels and has formed a fire-proof exterior.     Episode 4: Cold Kansas Desert  The rattleback is also making a stand in the Kansa desert. A bird species called the spinks, has adapted to underground life through the raging sandstorms. Also, the deathgleaners hunt for them on the surface like bats.    The second disc travels 100 million years into the future to find out more about the corse of evolution.     Episode 5: Waterland  The octopus family is taking its irst crawls onto land. The new name is the swampus. Their nest are located in plants, wich are in consistant danger of being toppled over by Torutons. Torutons are 120 ton creatures that feed on 1,323 pounds of food a day. Surprizingly, there closest relatives today is the tiny tortoise.   In the water, the lurkfish is always wating to shock its prey with 1,000 volts of electricity.     Episode 6: Flooded World  This episode is set in the shallow seas of the future. Many, many jellyfish have formed together to form the ocean phantom. In the ocean phantom's tenticles, the spindle trooper is always ready to get the food. By food, I mean the reef glider.    Episode 7: Tropical Antarctica  Antarctica has come north to the equator. As a result, it is covered with lush rainforests. These rainforests are home to spitfire beetles and spitfire birds. The flutterbird is also a welcome guest to this new Antarctica.     Episode 8: The Great Plateau  A great blue windrunner dominates the high altitudes of the new plateau. The plateau was formed when Australia when north and struck North America and Asia. The great blue windrunner is a four winged bird that  relys on the silver spider for food. The silver spider relys on the last mammal ever, the poggle, to give them food. They feed the poggle until it is fat enough, and then they kill it and feed the poor creature to the queen.    On the final disc, The timestream eccelerates to 200 million years into an alien world.    Episode 9: The Endless Desert  100 million years earlier, a massive asteroid impact wiped out 95 percent of the Earth's life-forms. After the world recovered, Pangea II became the new land mass. The endless desert was home to a veriety of creatures like the terabyte, and antlike insect thet shot sticky goo at its prey. Its prey, meaning the centapede-like garden worm, was helpless. In the water, the gloomworm and the slickribbon live in a bloody world.    Eisode 10: The Global Ocean  With one landmass, there was one ocean. The ocean flish flew over this ocean and fed on the common silver swimmer. But the food chain dosn't stop there. The rainbow squid feasts on the flish and the Sharkopah considers the rainbow squid a delicacy.    Episode 11: Graveland Desert  This world is home to a one legged snail called the desert hopper. These creatures share their desert home with a menagerie of other aliens including the deathbottle, the grimworm, and the bumblebeetle.     Episode 12: Tentacled Desert  In this final episode, squids have evolved to immense sizes, and have moved onto the land perminantly. The megasquid is a perfect example. This beast is larger then an elephant! Though it is huge, its flaw is that it is not very smart. Its treetop dwelling relative, the squibbon, is very social and very smart. This species could even trigger another civilization...    This is the exact reason that the future is wild",

Yes, we all know Robin Williams to be the slapstick comedian which has brought tears of laughter to our eyes instead of ones of compassion. But like  Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful, Williams brings to life a character who tries to lift the spirits of friends and strangers who are looking for one thing, hope.  Whether Williams' character was real or imaginary, the human spirit can never be completely wiped by tyranny and oppression. 10 million people, including 6 million Jews were systematically killed before the Nazi's were finally stopped. Some died as fighters, some gave their lives for others, and some gave just simple acts of kindness, good will, and love. Each one of them were heroes of their own kind.   William's character told lies about Russian troop advancement to give the Jews of his Ghetto the will to survive and resist. Like real life heroes such as Rauol Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler, Mordecai Anielewicz, Hannah Senesh, and thousands of others who risked their lives for others, this is a story of a good man.

Looks like we get the following, and if you don't believe me, go to the Tmnt website for hard evidence.  Here's what to expect acording to the press release from Funi.         Episodes include Still Nobody, The ancient One, Cyon of the Shredder, Prodigal Son, Outbreak, Trouble with Augie, Tale of Master Yoshi, Return of Savanti parts 1 and 2, Adventures in Turtle-sitting, Good Geens parts 1 and 2, and as for that 14th episode, could be Ninja Tribunal or Insane in the Membrane.  Maybe they'll go ahead with Insane, and just include the Tribunal episode in its own 14 episode release, if this one sells good, that is.  I don't see why they couldn't up the ep content to 15 and just go ahead and give us both.  But check the tmnt website for that press release if you're interested.  And looks like the price is pretty low too.  An excelent buy.  But your guess on that 14th ep is as good as mine, folks.  Maybe as the sept 12 release date draws nearer, someone can confirm the last episode we're getting.  Oh and I forgot Samurai Tourists.         Maybe they'll go ahead and give us Insane in the Membrane because it fits better in the story arc from season four.  And hopefully, we'll get Ninja Tribunal plus the 13 episodes that complete that arc at a later date.  Maybe by Christmas?  I hope so, anyway.         And do I really need to give a plot synopsis of the latter part of season four?  Well, I think I will anyway.  But if you're lookin for spoilers, you won't find them here.         Leonardo is still filled with anger due to his defeat at the hands of Shredder and Karai last season.  And after a few adventures in which he nearly loses control, Splinter sends him to Japan to find himself with the help of Yoshi's old master, the ancient one.  But while Leo is gone, a new Shredder suddenly attacks the turtles, and Leo must return home and do battle with this new foe.  Well, maybe not a new foe, but a foe with an attitude ajustment though.         Also in this portion of the season, slime from agent Bishop's alien creations which has seaped down into the sewers(see Aliens among us from Vol. 3.7: Hun on the Run) has mutated several animals near the turtles' home.  Its up to them to end this outbreak, but one of them is infected by one of the creatures, causing him to experience a second mutation into a mindless beast.  Now the turtles must make a deal with the devil, so to speak, in order to have their brother restored.  Agent Bishop SAYS he has a cure.  But in order for Bishop to administer it, our heros must steal a valuable object for him.  They must invade the stronghold of the new Shredder and steal the Heart of Tengu, but there are darker forces at work here.  Even Bishop doesn't comprehend the evil that will soon be unleashed upon the world.         So save up your cash and get ready for this interesting dvd release in September!",

            "input": "The Story Of Rubin Carter, According To Rubin Carter . The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.    The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.    The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.    I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.    The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title \"hero,\" would you still rate it highly?    If your answer is \"yes,\" then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.    Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.    Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.     I'm not counting on that, though",

            "input": "A look into the life of Dale Earnhardt . Not being from the South, and only regularly watching Nascar beginning in 1997, my opinions may not quite be as objective or fact vs. fiction as others.     The movie gives us a look into the legendary NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt.  Starting with his upbringing in a small mill town by a tough as nails father who dies in his prime, Ralph, who races the dirt tracks.  It was rumored that noone could ever beat Ralph when he raced.    The story gives us an insight into Dales life up to his tragic Death on the track, while along the way showing us all the people who were a part of his life and a part of what made him be who he was.  From his father, to other racers, his wives and kids, and his special friendship with another driver who perished on the track, Neil Bonnet.  It also shows his reaqaintance with his first son, Cary.  Dale is perplexed to learn that Cary also worked in the same mill that his dad and him worked in, making Cary a 3rd generation mill worker.    It also has a great depiction of Dale Jr., how his stubborness as a teenager is met with a wall of eqaulity from his father, and how the two ended up racing together in the end.    Barry Pepper does an excellent job, I feel, of playing the role of the great racer.  The cast was done superbly for this movie  and given their limited budget, I have to give ESPN a \"2 thumbs up\" for their effort in bringing us a great story about a great individual of our time.    I always had the assumption Dale was a bit of a jerk, a grump, well this movie not only proved that wrong but showed me that the whole track can be filled with grumps when it comes to racing for the next dollar or meal.  Dale Waltrip is portrayed as an arrogant instigator to Earnhardt early in his career.    The second to last scene in the movie leaves us breathless as it shows the 4th turn on the final lap of the Daytona 500 that would ultimately be Dale's last race.  The final scene in the movie, outside of the mill, was very fitting, I won't give it away so watch it!",

That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say \"That's not in the book...that's not in the book...\"    Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.       I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...     A kid chasing a ticket through a train,     A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,     A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,    (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)    OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...    A train sliding out of control on the ice,    A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,    A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the \"coaster tycoon\" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.     Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...    A train car running out of control through Santa's village,    Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...    Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.    At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!      And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.    So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a \"character driven\" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.    I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.",

The scenery was limited and tightly held.  I was particularly intrigued by the rain; it rained constantly, and some of the most interesting dialogue occurred during the various rainstorms.  Laura has become my most watched DVD because I'm constantly seeing little things that I missed before.  In addition, I adore the apartments of Laura and Waldo because they were decorated then pretty much as I want to decorate now.  Waldo's bathroom is to die for.  Incidentally, I watch the extended version because I love looking at Gene Tierney's wardrobe.",

            "input": "But we can be any self we want, can't we? . The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film.  I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie.  I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ... \"why\"?  Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit.  There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation.  Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending.  It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution.  Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved.  This was my biggest issue with this film.  The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine \"ripple-effect\" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.     Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film.  I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it.  It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all.  Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed.  Her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent.  She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time.  She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement.  It nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister.  She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention?  That was confusing and completely random.  Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent.  Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching Cavendish's daughter anything.  The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud.  I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally \"poofed\" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama.  It felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts).  Well, it didn't fool me, I saw that he was nearly a \"cut-and-paste\" character used to strengthen an already weakened story.  Don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story.  Again using the \"cut-and-paste\" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to.  It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ... but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood.  Fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.      The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble.  There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to Grandma about.  More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as I stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation.  What may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me.  Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ... eeewwww).  Also, she wore the same dress everyday.  That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television.  Sex and dirty laundry.  Now there is a great film for you!  There just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish.  Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.    Overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful.  I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation.  I don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation.  Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used.  If you were as confused about that as I was, then you will completely understand the film The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ... then, maybe this film is for you!

To cater to action fans, it is said that Don and Bruce (Campbell) were talking about having Bruce in Phantasm 5 and tie the Evil Dead franchise into it somehow, which could work considering that both of them deal with trancendence of time and space, and both seem to root themselves in the Lovecraftian mythos, not to mention the fact that Phantasm 2 and 3 were total Evil Dead, as well as Bubba Ho-Tep which Don aslo directed!   I really can not but love Don's non-sold out way of doing things. He raises the money for his love, and pours himself into it, has a lot of fun, and always delivers something well worth watching a million times over, so long as you have the patience or interest I guess, which ever.

This is a great trip down memory lane for any of you Star Wars nuts that grew up in the late 70s/early 80s. Remembering how things were back in 1979, I can see how this show managed to captivate me. No internet, no video games, no cable, VHS, DVD... not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe, as primitive as can be. We had nothing else. Even though as an eight year old, I knew this was kinda lame, it was an absolute godsend when there was only one TV in the house with a total of four channels.       Anyhow, stream of consciouness bullet list:     - First season is great cheese and hot chicks, second season is horrid.   - This is what Star Trek would have been if Roddenberry had come around ten years later.  - A Gil Gerard (circa 1979) versus William Shatner (circa 1969) stagefight would probably put me into a coma due to it's mind-blowing awesomeness.   - Ahead of even the great Princess Leia and the not-quite-as-great Cassiopia, Colonel Deering and Princess Amadala are the two women who made me realize I was down with the ladies, if you catch my very blatant drift. Nothing surpirsing here, but Erin Gray was my first crush.  - Twiki is not nearly as annoying as some stick-in-the-mud types would have you believe. His cheeseball comic relief works perfectly with Gil's cheeseball chest carpet and martial arts ability.  - Every scene involving \"dancing from the future\" or previously referenced martial arts is twenty times more entertaining that anything in the history of \"reality TV\".   - Hawk is not an interesting character, he is just the least crappy thing in a completely crappy second season.   - There are no extras at all, pretty dissapointing given the price point and the target audience of sci-fi geeks who thrive on that kinda stuff    In conclusion: I miss the days when Sci-Fi didn't have to beat you over the head and then strangle you with nothing but dread and darkness and doom. Buck Rogers takes place in post-apocolyptic, nuclear wasteland, mutants living in the desert, planet Earth... and it's still a hundred times less depressing than any of the cookie cutter sci-fi series plopped out in the last ten years.     Of course, we are a much more critical society nowadays... plumped up on years of cable networks, easily accessible VHS/DVD movies and other competitors for our time. Long gone are the days of shows like this. Shows where everybody involved, audience included, knew it was escapist/fantasy crap but just went along and had fun with it. Gil Gerard is an absolute joy to watch just because you always knew he was in on the joke (at least during the first season). Everybody takes themselves too seriously nowadays, especially Sci-Fi. The new Battlestar series is so painfully self-aware it's basically a soap-opera that happens to be in space.     Anyhoo... If are a male sci-fi fan who was between the ages of let's say... 6 to 12... when this series made it's run, go out and buy it. For better or worse, Buck Rogers took me back to the late 70s much more effectively than Star Wars or Battlestar.     4/5 only due to the complete lack of extra",

I bought all of these 6 DVDs separately because I did not know that they came as a set, at a better price! I paid about $15 each, about $90 total, and I do not regret owning them all, but I would have jumped on this set if I had known about it!    Most of these DVDs are very interesting and faithful to Scripture. SAMSON & DELILAH is the weakest of these 6 DVDs, as it spends too much time on non-scriptural characters. ABRAHAM covers many scenes of the 40 year wandering rarely seen on DVD. JACOB is pretty close to Scripture. JOSEPH is great, but it spends a bit too much time rewriting the narration to allow for Ben Kingsley's Potiphar role to expand. I have not yet watched DAVID, but I look forward to Leonard Nimoy's appearance in the film.    Most of these films are 3 hours long, presumably they were mostly all short mini-series when they originally ran on TV. I think only JACOB is about 90 minutes, of the 6 DVDs in this set. You can read about each DVD as they are all sold separately on amazon.com.    All of these 6 DVDs have major TV network, made-for-TV quality, and I am quite surprised and pleased that these movies are so good. I do not know of any better series of Bible stories on DVD.    There is another Box Set available, THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which has 3 other DVDs of this series of movies. JEREMIAH is my favorite of all 9 movies. ESTHER is great, and perhaps the most faithful to Scriptural accuracy and chronology of all 9 movies. SOLOMON is the only 3 hour DVD in this smaller Box Set. There is a GENESIS in this Box Set, but it is not a dramatized movie, just a narration of the book of Genesis, while modern day nomads are shown going about their daily routine. GENESIS is a disappointment and very UNLIKE the other 9 movies, so much so that it doesn't even seem to be part of the same production series.    Bottom Line: I highly recommend that anybody buy both of these box sets, and they will save about 50% over buying each DVD separately! Praise the LORD",

Shannon were commenting on, but it doesn't seem possible that it was 'Bloody Sunday'.  Ms. Shannon, Ross Hughes and 'A viewer' seem to think that the film is pro-IRA - boy, did they miss the point.  As for Abe \"Starman\" in WVA, clearly he doesn't even understand the basic facts behind the film.  As for Roland Zwick and Gitana3000, I think they need to gain some experience in accented English.  The Northern Irish dialect is not that hard to understand.  Heck, go and see a movie set in Yorkshire, Glasgow or Durham - those are difficult accents.  It's a fact of modern realistic filmmaking that when a film is set in Northern Ireland it's going to feature Northern Irish accents - it's something everyone should be able to deal with.  Heck, I found the movie 'Matewan' difficult to understand, but I don't demand subtitles, or that they tone down the accents, for a movie that's in my own language.  Instead I learn to understand the variations - it's not that difficult, and it's something that stands a person in good stead when he ventures out into the real world.  Only in US documentaries and news shows do we see subtitles when people are speaking clear and intelligable English.  What is it with that?  I mean do people in New York need subtitles when listening to folks from North Dakota?    Anyway, rant over.  This is a great film which gives Bloody Sunday very evenhanded treatment.  Perhaps if people saw the film before commenting, and perhaps if they took the time to understand the film before they started to write a review, this film would get fairer reviews.    As others here have said, don't see this movie and think it gives an overview of 'The Troubles' because it doesn't.  It shows one day when one group of soldiers killed a lot of innocent people - as such it illustrates how poor armies are at keeping the peace - it shows how the British Army killed a few of the 365 people it killed during 'The Troubles'.  What it doesn't show is how brutal the IRA, INLA & other so-called 'republicans' (who killed 2153 people) or the Loyalists (who killed 1080) can be",

Antzcak's direction is inexplicable and the film is weighed down by a directionless, melodramatic script and technical shortcomings. The ADR (dialog overdubbing) is incompetent and terribly distracting, making the film sound like a radio drama recorded in a basement; all the more odd considering that in all other respects the project seems well-funded and professional -- great sets, superior costuming and impeccable lighting. The gorgeous cinematography is brutalized by a directorial style characterized by long, tedious dialog punctuated by frenetic, fast-cut flashback and dream sequences that contribute neither to our understanding of Chopin's character nor the events driving the plot forward. Non-sequiturs abound; Antzcak seems to have been attempting to create a mood piece to accompany the brilliant musical performances, rather than a sustained narrative. But the only moods sustained are bewilderment and boredom.    Chopin comes off as a selfish boor of a prima dona; perhaps historically acurate, but hardly compelling on screen. What does it say about this movie that, in a crucial scene where a wagon carrying Chopin nearly topples over a precipice, you find yourself rooting for the precipice?    Unlike the vastly superior Amedeus or the merely pedestrian Immortal Beloved, you learn nothing about the connection between the composer's life and his music. Antzack seems singularly uninterested in the historical signifigance of Chopin's acheivement, the nature of his talent's development, his freindship/rivalry with Liszt, or the musical environment of the day. Desire for Love actually has more in common with a film like Jules et Jim, in that it dwells on the inner dynamics of a doomed and disfunctional romance; unfortunately the characters aren't one tenth as compelling or sympathetic.    Desire for Love ends with the composer's protracted death, like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved did with Mozart and Beethoven, respectively. But it fails to evoke the tragic mood of the latter two; the film itself seems infected by a consumptive, cinematic analog of the protagonist's malaise, eating itself from within and finally wheezing to a merciful termination",

Wood suspects the evil, but no one will believe him, and so he is left alone to try to stop the increasingly deadly games his cousin is playing.    Director Joseph P. Ruben made something of a career of telling tales of domestic horror, what with this, The Stepfather and Sleeping with the Enemy. He claims, in the featurette, to want to reverse our expectations about Culkin's character, which is, of course, nonsense: we know going in that he's bad. And familiar as Evil Child territory is (think The Bad Seed, The Other, The Omen, etc., etc., etc.), this is still an effective example of the genre, benefiting from an admirably economical narrative.    The menu is basic, as are the extras: the theatrical trailer, and the usual featurette. Nuthin' special.    Very much a catalogue-filler release, with no real value-added on this disc.

So I bought this STREET LAW DVD brand new, as soon as Amazon offered it, without waiting for the price to go down.  I unwrap the pristine-looking DVDm pop it into the player, and after a few minutes it pauses.    Then it pauses again.  It pauses constantly throughout the film.  I mean at least once a minute, often several times a minute.  Pause, pause, pause.  Most of the pauses are brief, some last several seconds.  I eventually took out the DVD, cleaned it, but it didn't help.  I suffered through 50 minutes of this film, then gave up.    VHS was a decent format.  Tape had problems, but nowhere near as bad as DVD, with all the skipping and scratching.  (And Google \"DVD rot\" -- see what comes up.)      Still, changing formats is a great way for studios to resell us movies we'd already bought, so I guess it makes sense for them.

This first scene of this film caught my attention immediately, it was sort of telling me \"Sit tight and pay attention Jenny.\" \"S√≥lo m√≠a' is another film about gender violence in the family. It adopts a totally different attitude to the subject matter when compared with Ic√≠ar Bolla√≠n's film which is at once more subtle in its telling.   `S√≥lo m√≠a' shoves the nitty-gritty between your teeth so that you can choke on it: some of the scenes are too explicit, one might argue, and are numerously frequent; in `Te doy Mis Ojos' the hard subject matter is more carefully handled.    However, Paz Vega, who starred in `Luc√≠a y el Sexo' (qv) the same year, put in a recommendable performance as the badly beaten and tortured young mother; Sergi L√≥pez as her husband plays his part well, though at times seemed to over forcefully portray his performance, thus almost beggaring belief. It should be said that his role was very tricky, to say the least. I feel that Luis Tosar carried off his performance in `Te doy Mis Ojos' more convincingly, with better balancing between the extremes of tensions and feelings.    The rest of the cast form a good back-up to the leading couple.    This film also points an accusing finger at the legal system, in which hypocritical legalities and aloofness does little - or nothing - to help solve this horrifying situation so evident today in so many headlines in Spain today. Something has got to be done: more than 70 women were killed in `gender violence' in Spain in 2003. At the end it's a great film, I truly admire European cinema that doesn't sugar coat their films.

John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film",

Instead of Ben Mears coming to town and finding the Marsten house already sold, Crockett has already promised it to Mears, but now he's renegged and sold it out from under him. I don't see the point. They didn't just change the story, they didn't leave anything intact. It's bad. It's unwatchable, especially if you loved the book. None of the characters have Maine accents... Hmm.

            "input": "McNamara's Not-Quite Confession... and for good reason . My first glimpse of Errol Morris' work (The Thin Blue Line) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role (and subsequent fallacy) of human memory in historical discourse.  While \"The Thin Blue Line\" examined a singular Texas murder, Morris' \"Fog of War\" has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old McNamara and his position in United States war policy over a thirty year span.  World War II and Vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary, but the \"larger footprint\" of Morris' film rests with the controversial nature of McNamara in the public's mind versus the historical record.  In short, McNamara bears some responsibility (and perhaps lingering guilt) for his recommendations in the WWII bombing and the Vietnam policy.  The Vietnam War was not his action alone, however; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act:  The President of the United States.  Accordingly, McNamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition.  Yet, he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the Vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the Kennedy/Johnson Era (as well as the WWII bombing decisions).  McNamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the American public want a criminal confession from the man.        With that \"public pitfall\" in mind, McNamara's explanations and answers to Morris' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous, but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework.  At one point in the film, Morris' essentially asks McNamara who was responsible for Vietnam decisions and McNamara quickly replies, \"The President\".  The audience (or at least, I) wanted McNamara to answer, \"It was my decision\" and - as such - may view the President Response as a cop-out.  However, McNamara is absolutely correct; the decision for action rested with the Commander-in-Chief and his name was never Robert Strange McNamara.  From the audience's perspective, it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting (i.e., not damning) the two presidents he served and loved.      Personally, I relished the personal insights Morris captured (or that McNamara permitted himself to show?).  These poignant glimpses ranged from McNamara's tearful story of surveying Arlington National Cemetery for Kennedy's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the McNamara Family during the Secretary of Defense years.  My favorite insight into McNamara's soul comes during the retelling of the young Quaker who set himself on fire below McNamara's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander.  While the story is well known, McNamara pays respect to the widow's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter.  I am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others, but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film.      In terms of filmmaking, some reviews have blasted Morris' technique of being off camera and unmiked, his use of the Glass soundtrack, or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes, bombing, or protests.  In many respects, they are right:  either you love Morris' methods or they will grate on you.  The editing cuts can be choppy, but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material.  If you enjoy a bombastic Michael Moore-type figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric, then \"The Fog of War\" may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental.  On the other hand, if you enjoyed Morris' earlier \"The Thin Blue Line\" or Barbara Kopple's \"Harlan County, USA\" and \"American Dream\", then you will want to buy this DVD for the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and McNamara's own rules.",

            "input": "Complete butchering of a good story . I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned.  Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad.  Turns out, the word bad is an understatement.    Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc.  But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat.  I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away.  The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included.  Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown.  Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing.    I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply \"everybody must die!\".  Period.  That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to.  I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie.    Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked.  What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film?  Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours.  Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles?  Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire.    I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc.  Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence \"revealing\" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place.  I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me.    Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time.  But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie",

In general, I love dance but despise dance workouts, (boring and often annoying), but this instructor is genuine and her choices and pacing are appropriate.  Further, she breaks the video down into mini-routines, so if you wanted to, you could memorize the routines and mix and match them to your own music, (she provides counts - mostly 8 but some 4 & 16 - throughout the video).  The background dancers have typical bodies rather than being ridiculously skinny with huge boobs, which is a nice change.  Finally, if you do not emphasize your core and hip movements, this workout will be much less effective, so if you haven't danced before and aren't used to posture and breathing, keep in mind that you will need to focus on using these muscles, or your moves will be too sloppy to provide a workout",

            "input": "Possibly one of the worst movies ever . There is nothing redeeming about this movie. No. I'm sorry. There's no negotiating with that. I don't care if I come back and see \"0 of 2,000 people have found this review helpful\" I won't change my opinion. This movie is just flat out BAD! Why is it so bad? I could write a book on it, but I can sum it all up by simply saying it is your typical disaster film. It follows every single cliche in the book. And I don't mean fun cliche like horror movies, I mean like you know what's going to happen the entire movie five minutes in.     1. Natural disaster of ludicrous proportions hits America. No other nation is affected, of course, or if they are only to a slight degree.  2. Government leaders go, \"OMFG WTF?\" and try to prevent it. Initial destruction is prevented by blocking up the storyline with subplots.  3. Some cockamany idea to stop the disaster is attempted. It works...  4. ...for about five seconds. Then real disaster hits and millions die. Let's think seriously here: how many mega natural disasters have befallen major American cities? Like serious disasters? I can think of two: San Francisco in the early 1900's and recently New Orleans. Yet somehow in movies when a natural disaster hits, it ALWAYS hits a highly populated area.    There's loads more cliches - hell, a section in Part Two concerning people escaping a destroyed casino is basically a thirty minute \"Poseidon's Adventure.\" With such ingenuity, you wouldn't expect too much character development, would you? I hope not, because this movie has the most typical assortment of characters you'll ever find:    * The government official who tells other characters what's going on and shoots people worried looks.  * The typical government leader (in this case, the president) who mostly does yelling and pity-playing   * The feisty, independent daughter who has a coming of age moment - and who by the way, happens to be the president's daughter and happens to get her father to ask the Secret Service to leave her alone. Um...the president doesn't even have the power to tell the Secret Service to leave HIM alone.  * The wife trapped in a building who turns out to be pregnant.  * The two brothers who hate each other but learn to cope with one another before one of them dies.  * The guy who yells \"I'm getting out of here!\" and gets killed upon trying to escape.  * The worry-wort girl who is told \"You'll make it out of here\" only to die two minutes later.  * The stubborn old folks who refuse to leave their home, even with immenant death and destruction headed their way. Why? \"This is our home!\" Your suburban house in Houston? PLEASE! Unless you're living on freggin' Indian burial grounds, don't tell me your small patch of turf is worth getting yourself killed for.    You're supposed to care for these people. You're supposed to feel bad when they die. But since they're the same cookie-cutter characters you've seen a hundred times in a hundred different disaster movies, you really don't care.     But let me get to my biggest beef with this movie...WHO THE HECK DIRECTED THIS?! Lemme check IMDB...John Lafia? Hey John - DON'T EVER DIRECT AGAIN! Or if you do, here's a little advice - KEEP YOUR DAMN CAMERA STILL! Every single shot is either shaky cam or zooms. Yes, zoom. Zoom in. Zoom out. Zoom in. Zoom out. Every single shot. Doesn't matter the mood, tone, or action. Zoom in. Zoom out. It's like they didn't plan out any of the scenes and the camera man had to correct every shot. This gets old in about five minutes. No, actually, it got old in ten seconds. And considering this is a two-part miniseries, about an hour and a half long each, it's enough to have someone commit suicide.    Is this movie good? No, because I've seen it already. I saw it when it was called \"Deep Impact.\" I sall it when it was called \"Armaggedon.\" I saw it when it was \"Dante's Peak.\" I saw it when it was \"Volcano.\" I saw it when it was \"Asteroid.\" I saw it when it was...ARG!! My apologies for the bitter review, but this movie really tried my patience. I cannot understand how there are people out there that like this. I suppose there is a secret cult of self-mutilating masochists out there who enjoy punishing themselves by watching bad movies for their own sick, evil amusement. Then again, perhaps I hate and love this movie as much as I hate and love myself..",

Indecent Proposal's intriguing premise starts off with a provocative question: \"What would you do if I offered you a million dollars to spend the night with your wife?\" In its attempt to explore sexuality, morals and ethics in America, the movie's writers, producers, and director are too afraid of the controversial subject matter to provide a clear answer to the question it asks the audience. Instead of being thought provoking film, the movie deteriorates into another predictable by the numbers forgettable commercial Hollywood drama. If the studios gave me million dollars I could make a better film than this.   Indecent Proposal follows a struggling California married couple drowning$50,000 in debt. Out of work and desperate for cash, they go on a trip to Vegas. Browsing in a hotel store, Diana runs into a Billionaire John Gage who has eyes on her. He offers to buy her a $5000 dress she has eyes on. Diana says she can't be bought. Gage sees a challenge. Shawn sees a predictable plot twist.  Thinking nothing of her encounter she returns to the gambling tables with her husband. After winning $25,000, Halfway towards their goal, the couple heads back to their room planning to gamble more unaware of how Hollywood casinos operate. Predictably they lose all their winnings. Both run into Gage who asks Diana to go to his table for luck. Gage plays a high stakes game betting a million dollars on a crap table. After winning his high stakes bet, Gage asks the couple to join him in his suite. There he proposes his indecent proposal: A night with the wife in exchange for a million dollars. The cash-strapped couple declines, but ponders taking him up on his offer on the way back to the hotel room. Set your watch for what happens next.  Soon after the proposal the movie falls apart. Gage buys her the expensive dress sweetens the pot. Upon getting the dress the couple decides takes up Gage on his offer. With his wife on the way, Woody hangs out with a lawyer buddy. Soon after talking to him, Harrelson's character gets second thoughts. He races for the roof to cancel the deal but is too late to stop the helicopter. How predictable.  On the boat we watch Diana getting ready. She and Gage meet up and have dinner and drinks. We don't know if they have relations; the movie leaves that as a mystery. Diana and her husband return to California to pay their debts. They soon find out John Gage has bought out their mortgage. Things start to get ridiculous from here. The manipulative Gage only bought the house as part of a tactic to possess Diana. He goes to her real estate job and tries to court her. I guess one night of her good stuff wasn't good enough for her. Harrelson's character starts to become insecure, wanting graphic details of the encounter. His jealousies cause him to act irrational and angry like every other movie husband. Feeling stressed out, Diana leaves her husband for the super rich Gage. Yawn.  Losing his woman, Harrelson takes a teaching job and starts working on his future. Getting the divorce papers, he goes to an auction for animals. There he spends the one million dollars on a hippo to prove how much he loves her. He signs the divorce papers and she goes off with her billionaire man. He gets a change of heart when he realizes she still loves him. Yawn.  Later in the car, Gage and his driver talk about how they've played this game over a dozen times. Diana requests he stop the car. They break up and she gets on a bus. Later she meets her ex-husband at the pier he proposed to her at and the movie comes to a clunky unsatisfying close.  The performances are terrible. The entire cast is uninspired; no one in this film makes an effort to bring any type of depth to their characters. Woody Harrelson is horribly miscast. I don't believe him as an architecture expert. Demi Moore is wooden in the role of Diana. She brings no dimension to the character at all. I feel no tension or stress from her even though she's playing a woman conflicted by tremendous emotional and moral pressures. Robert Redford is charming and handsome, as John Gage but the character seems like a one-dimensional caricature instead of a human being. Look for Billy Bob Thornton in a small role as a tourist.  Indecent Proposal isn't indecent it's just bland. It doesn't take any of the risks in its exploration of its taboo subject matter. Aside from some lukewarm sex scenes early on between the married couple, the movie is just another by the numbers Hollywood drama pretending to be a thought provoking film. The provocative ideas about sexual morals and ethics advertised in its premise are just a selling point to trick customers into spending money on it. Don't let this movie con you out of your hard earned cash. Instead of accepting this mediocre proposal on the video rack, I suggest you pick up Summer of '42, When Harry Met Sally or Love Story.",

This review is for my wife, Marilyn, as our wedding song came from it:    I was a senior in high school when this movie first hit the theaters and I loved it then and I love it now.  Yes, the acting is a bit hammy by Laurence Olivier who was attempting to appease the Jewish population after giving an Oscar-nominated performance a year or so before for playing with great relish a vicious Nazi who tortures, via dentist equipment, Dustin Hoffman in \"The Marathon Man.\"  Can anyone forget his famous line from that film, \"Is it safe?\"   In addition, Lucie Arnez is no great actress, but what she lacks in talent she makes up for in her charming honest portrayal as Diamond's compassionate agent.   Lastly, Neil Diamond is certainly no great actor either, no matter how much I love him as musician and entertainer, but this movie somehow works despite these noted flaws and some rather amateurish direction by Richard Fleicher.  Perhaps the movie succeeds because the plot is as timeless as Hollywood gets.    We all love to experience someone achieving his or her goals and that's why these kinds of movies withstand the test of time even when the critics blast them.  Consider the following:  While Olivier hams it up a bit, he is still great to watch and demands your respect.   Lucie Arnez is disarmingly charming in her role as an agent trying to help someone she believes in, but also trying not to be caught up in her client's personal life.  Of course, Neil Diamond is no actor, but he is pleasing to watch and he's certainly believable in a role that he was destined to play as it mirrors his own story quite a bit; he came from a family of dentists and was expected to be one also, but he dropped out in his last semester and hit the road with a backpack and his guitar --the rest is history.  Lastly, the music is awesome.  Diamond was at the height of his career musically when he did this film and the soundtrack produced 3 #1 songs and was one of Billboard's longest running soundtrack best-sellers.  This was no fluke as Diamond had already won praise for his song \"Be\" from the film \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull.\"  He knows how to write music for films and I wish he had more opportunities to do so.    While the movie wasn't necessarily \"a hit,\" but it did find a substantial audience and made a good profit.  Something about it made it work even though it is admittedly flawed.  It went on to greater success on VHS and DVD and this new addition will probably sell just as well or better with the improved sound clarity that the other releases seriously lacked.  I was happy to read here that I wasn't the only one turning up the volume for the dialogue and lower it for the music segments.  That drove me nuts in the earlier releases.    Moving along, although I am Christian, I grew up in a mostly Jewish section in Brooklyn, New York, in fact, not far from where Diamond and Streisand actually grew up.  My home was near Diamond's high school.  Anyhow, between that and having dated a wonderful Jewish girl most of my high school days I grew to appreciate the Jewish faith and culture.  My neighborhood local theater re-released this film numerous times and I went to see it each time they played it.  It was the first movie I took my wife to see back in April of 1983 and she loved it and cried at the end as many in the theater did.  The #1 song \"Hello Again\" went on to become \"our song\" and the one we danced to at our wedding as your spouse should also be your best friend and that's what the song is about and even the movie as well to some degree as Diamond's wife in the film never shared his interests or desires although she was aware of them since they were little kids growing up in the same neighborhood.  She kept crying how he had changed when he became a pop-rock star when in reality his desires had simply come true.  All she ever attempted to do in the film was either hold him back or ignore his dreams and a spouse should never do either of those.    Having said all this it is obvious that my love for Diamond's music, Hollywoods tireless theme of success against the odds, watching any performance by the great Olivier, and sharing this film with the woman I would eventually spend the next 24 years of my life with make me a bias reviewer here.  I concede that observation, but still contend that in spite of this film's obvious flaws, it is still great entertainment.    Enjoy this classic",

I mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie. And this from a reviewer who called this movie racist--talk about hypocrite!    Quite frankly, I thought this movie was hilarious. The acting is supposed to be life-less. The movie is supposed to be uneventful. But if you pay attention to the nuances, the slight glances, you might understand a bit more. For instance, when Napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in, he does so with the utmost care and then, he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed. For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario?    I am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you don't, either you are a literal or figurative thinker, either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear. The point is you don't HAVE to like this movie. No one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee! You also don't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it. Liking this movie does not mean I don't like other more classic/mainstream comedies. Young Frankenstein, The Birdcage, The Producers, The Wedding Singer etc are all great movies and great comedies. Napoleon Dynamite is just one more that SOME people in enjoy. So lighten up",

            "input": "The Long-forgotten  Misunderstood Chevy Chase Movie . When I was 12 this movie was a staple on the then still-blossoming HBO.  I think I've watched it or seen bits and pieces of it like more than thirty times. As a kid there were a lot of things I didn't get, of course, but it was funny to me. Now, that was 1982.  Twenty-three years later I saw it on Amazon and nostalgia just washed over me.  I had to have it.  Finally, I thought, Modern Problems and Foul Play have been released to DVD, two childhood staples...  I watched both movies.  Modern Problems was as I remembered it, mostly.  I get all the jokes and situations now that I'm an adult, of course, but there were some other things I got as well.  This isn't the happy-go-lucky Chevy Chase that we all remember from Cassyshack and Seems Like Old Times, this is the darker side.  Modern Porblems has its share of ridiculousness, but beneath the surface, this is a pretty dark comedy.  When Chevy uses his telekinetic powers to make his ex-girlfriend's date's nose start bleeding, Jesus it is hysterical, but at the same time...when you have a chance to think about it...quite grim.  There is an underlying 'life sucks' theme going on here which was where the world was in 1981 and I think this movie captures that pretty well.  Is this my favorite Chevy Chase movie? No. Fletch and Vacation and Christmas Vacation and Caddyshack are.  There's been a lot of others, too.  Is this a classic?  I'd say, yes.  Here is 1981 all rolled up and categorized in a comedy by the reigning star of the time.  A little slice of Regan-era fatalism.  Enjoy",

I've seen college level work and home movies that are more insightful and entertaining.  I had the chance once to see Stan Brakhage live in New York to screen one of his newer films a few years back. It was a film he shot in Vancouver of the beach, and, seriously, it was like watching somebody's home movies of the beach. Then afterwards he goes into a discussion about the film and how it represents him dealing with illness and life and death. He was so pretentious and full of himself I had to laugh.

I watched this movie not knowing anything about it, and I honestly thought as soon as Diane learns she's pregnant and gives her boyfriend the news, that he was going to leave her, but he couldn't have been more happy. In fact, the only people upset with the news are their parents who disown them, leaving the young couple to fend for themselves. They marry and take minimum wage jobs to pay for their apartment and the expected twins, but it's not enough. But that doesn't stop the A-squad from coming up with a heist plan sure to give the couple the cash they need to care for their babies. Told from the point of view of a bitter B-squad cheerleader, this is one of those fun movies like Mean Girls that's funny yet sweet without being too sugary.

I picked this DVD off the rack as a random selection, mainly because I don't believe that Sean Penn has ever appeared in a bad movie....and this has got to be one of his best (even though he was probably still a teenager when it was produced in 1983).     He portrays a young delinquent purse snatcher and mugger named Mick O'Brien, who is rapidly escalating the violence of his crimes. Ultimately, during an attempted drug robbery his best friend is murdered and he accidentally runs over the young brother of his bitter enemy, Paco Moreno (fairly well portrayed by Esai Morales....he is definitely no Sean Penn).     Because of his youth, Mick is sent to a grim, grimy, violent juvenile detention center presided over by the \"usual suspects\": inattentive, seemingly deaf guards who allow atrocities to be perpetrated daily and with no consequences....prison trustees (Clancy Brown portrays one) who flaunt the rules, sexually abuse at will, and terrorize the inmates....and a warden who is a weak, fickle joke.     By standing up to the trustees and demonstrating his talents for mayhem and maniacal violence, Mick becomes the dominant inmate....in effect, ruling the place, until two things happen to challenge him: Paco rapes Mick's girlfriend (revenge for the death of his brother) and gets sentenced to the same juvenile detention center as Mick. They now hate each other more than ever, and are trapped within the same hellish institution....you KNOW that something horrific is going to happen.     Sorry, but if you want to see how this incredible set-up plays out, you'll have to rent or buy the DVD....and I assure you, it will be money well spent. The acting is superb (Sean is incredible, even as a teenager, exuding an undercurrent of barely-controlled violence); the plot is suspenseful and bloody but always makes perfect sense; the direction, cinematography, sets, sound, etc. are terrific. This is a genuinely excellent movie....I give it my highest recommendation.",

            "input": "Remarkable!  Pure Visual Poetry . Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico is a film that captures the majesty, awe, and tragedy of Mexico better than any other I have ever seen.  And it does so not with dialogue or plot, but rather thru \"a sequence of short novellas\" (Eisenstein's words) which each develop and play convincingly into the next.  Each of these vignettes to me display a celebration of real Mexican culture and a subtle depreciation of those things which came from Spain.  They evoke the heart of true Mexican patriotism as if it were struck directly from a Rivera mural.  For anyone interested in Mexico or Mexican cinema, Que Viva Mexico is an absolute must.        Que Viva Mexico is certainly one of the most famous \"unfinished\" films in history, with a tragic star-laced history about which whole books have been published.  In a few words, Sergei Eisenstein went to Hollywood but was almost immediately ostracized by the old studio moguls.  Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin led him to the famed moralist, communist, and novelist Upton Sinclair, who agreed to finance a south-of-the border film.  The budget was $25k and shooting was to take four months.  Sinclair's brother-in-law was to tag along and supervise.  A couple of Eisenstein's Russians comrades would handle the cinematography and equipment.      Exactly what happened after that is a matter of some dispute, including countless cross and counter accusations of extremely lewd behavior and fabulous revelry.  What is certain is that after 11 months in Mexico the film was still missing its final section and Sinclair pulled the plug on the whole operation.  Furious, he then managed to block Eisenstein's return to America and convince Stalin he had been a poor communist.  Sinclair kept all the footage and Eisenstein was sent back to Russia in shame.    Eisenstein still believed he could make a great film out of his footage and fought to get it back, but Sinclair refused and had it edited by his own Hollywood producer.  From this work came the feature Thunder Over Mexico (1933) and the shorts Eisenstein in Mexico (1933) and Death Day (1934).  While these versions influenced great future directors like Welles, Huston, Bunuel, and Leone, they were not the real vision of the great director.  In the 1970s, the Russians finally got the reels, and Grigori Aleksandrov, who had been there and assisted with the original filming, put it back together following Eisenstein's original plan.       Back to the film, it is essentially a silent with narration, a music track, and limited sound effects added.  I don't have any problem with this as the alternative would have been to fabricate intertitles which would have been even less natural.  Anyway talkies were already completely dominant by 1932 and Chaplin used a sound effect track in all his later silents.  The musical track is sheer magic and certainly benefits from the extra years.  There is an abrupt break when the final unfilmed section is reached, before we are taken back to the Day of the Dead epilogue.  Frankly, I don't think much was lost here: Eisenstein was right when he said he didn't need that last segment to finish the film.  The third segment was already just a bit long, and adding the fourth (a continuation of the third) would have unbalanced the film.  Hence I would have just run the third segment straight into a more somber start of the epilogue.  But the way it was done does show us what was \"lost\", so in that sense it is valid.  My only qualm with this DVD is the fact that it doesn't have Spanish subtitles, as I think all Mexicans should experience this film!      One last thing:  the 1946 epoca dorada classic Enamorada by famed Mexican director Emilio Fernandez could be seen as a sort of tribute film to Eisenstein and Que Viva Mexico, as it basically fills out a story based on the sodadera lost segment of this film.",

The only bad thing about this package is that the audio on the DVD is sub-par. This doesnt mean that it is bad, it just isnt the kind of quality I would expect from a big time band like Coheed and Cambria. Even though the audio isnt that great, I still watch the thing all the time. The best part of this package is the CD that comes along with it. This is worth buying this product alone. I suggest putting the CD on full blast and watching the DVD on mute. All in all I give the DVD 3 out of 5 and the CD 5 out of 5 which averages out to a decent 4. This should hold anyone that needs a Coheed fix until they put out their next C",

It's beautifully filmed, interesting throughout, and really makes you feel you are there.  True, Scott is, on the whole, shown in a less than favorable light, but given many of the decisions he made, it would be hard for that not to be the case.  To the film's credit it goes to great lengths to give the context/history behind the mindset that led to those poor decisions.  Likewise with Amundsen, you see his greatness mixed with his flaws.  I wouldn't change a thing about the movie itself.  As to the quality of the film transfer and the sound, it seemed perfectly fine to me - though I'm hardly an expert on such things.  As for the packaging, I admit I was a little disappointed there was absolutely no booklet of any kind, nor are there any \"extras\" on the discs themselves.  You strictly get the 7 episodes on 3 discs in a double-wide hard case.  But given that exploration is rarely the subject of any movie, let alone one of this length, I consider this set a real find, worth every penny, and I will treasure it.  One side note: The DVD case says \"Featuring Hugh Grant & Max VonSydow\", but a very young Hugh Grant has just a tiny little part in this 1985 film, so don't buy this hoping to see him or you'll be disappointed!",

            "input": "A collection of films you'll find nowhere else for the serious film history buff . If I was getting a gift for TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne, and I knew he didn't already have this DVD set I would (a) be very surprised and (b) buy it for him. This DVD set is for film buffs who aren't satisfied with the essentials that everyone knows about - \"Birth of a Nation\", \"The Jazz Singer\", \"Frankenstein\", etc., which are great films, but don't tell the whole story of early cinema. The set was organized by Bruce Posner and runs to some nineteen hours, and is an astonishing achievement. The set consists of seven discs each of which explore a different aspect of early cinema.     Among the films included are Douglass Crockwell's \"Simple Destiny Abstractions\", plus some animations with some very good detail on the level of Windsor McCay. The 1928 version of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" focuses more on displaying some complex optical work than the story, reducing Poe's tale to only ten minutes in length. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" is an example of pinboard animation, in which a film is made completely using shadows from a pin screen. This technique continued to be used for decades. Suspense - a 1913 melodrama in which a housewife and her baby are nearly attacked by a knife-wielding drifter - is included because of its split-screen techniques. However, it is also interesting as the beginnings of what became the psycho-thrillers that exist to this day.    For the budget conscious, the disc entitled \"PICTURING A METROPOLIS, New York City Unveiled\" is the only disc available for individual purchase. This particular disc is great for history buffs as well as film buffs for all of its views of New York City life during the period from 1890-1940. The New York City disc moves from early footage of the city, including the Edison Company's famous and poetic Coney Island at Night, to Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's well-known Manhattan, to some work by Rudy Burckhardt, the film-maker, photographer, and painter who was also one of de Kooning's earliest friends in New York.    There are also some films financed by the depression-era WPA. Among them, Elia Kazan makes an appearance in a rather odd socialist movie about the poor of New York. There are some pictures sponsored by Labor Unions that offer 'alternative newsreels' that expose illegal business thuggery and a reactionary murder cult known as The Black Legion. Entertainment figures that are later blacklisted for their political beliefs and actions also make an appearance here - most notably, Paul Robeson, an actor often forgotten because of this. Robeson can be seen narrating a film on organized labor in this collection.    The disc entitled \"The Beginnings of Cin√©-Dance\" has quite a bit of variety, but is still clearly delimited, opening with Annabelle Moore's \"Butterfly Dance\" and offering near its end David Bradley's Peer Gynt of 1941, starring a teenage Charlton Heston.    Some of the best material on the set is from Hollywood, probably due to the larger budgets involved. Included in this category would be some of the original montages of Slavko Vorkapich that were done for some MGM movies. This includes a bit of film in which the entire Napoleanic war appears to play out in just two minutes. Also included is Vorkapich's opening montage to \"Crime Without Passion\" in which three banshees fly about and terrorize the streets of Manhattan. The Ernst Lubitsch \"touch\" also apparently includes montages, and there is an excerpt from 1926's \"So This is Paris\" that shows a flapper dance in montage. It does a good job of conveying the wildness of the place at that time, which is part of the central theme of the movie. Also included are Busby Berkeley's numbers \"Lullaby of Broadway\" and \"By a Waterfall\", which are light compared to the other pieces with their more hidden deeper meanings.     I could go on forever describing the contents of this DVD set, but these were the pieces that stood out the most to me, anyway. The label of \"Avant Garde\" does not really fit this collection as we know the meaning of the term today. After all, there is work here by the Edison Company, D.W. Griffith, and a host of other people who have secure places in mainstream motion picture history. The \"Avant Garde\" label is more of an indication that film as an artform during the time period covered was inherently avant-garde just because it was new. The quality of the video is quite good considering the probable shape of the originals. I personally love this set and think it is well worth the price",

I am huge fan of New Order and Joy Division and think they are one of the most important modern western popular bands of the last, almost thirty years for all their well-known contributions to existentilism and furturism in alternative, independent rock. Basically inventing post-punk, being one of the inventors of the dance-music, electronica scene a decade before most other bands and accidentaly inventing \"goth\" music along the way.   Not to mention being excellent musicians with a very artsy, deep and humorous sensitivity.    But, because they are such a good band it is glarringly obvious that the \"rock video\" is nothing more than a corporate music business era chore that bands just have to do as part of the job.    Film critic Rodger Ebert once said the rock video is \"empty.\"    Here, they aren't so much empty as New Order's music is so good, just pointless.                I find myself almost angry that a beautiful song such as \"Ceremony\" would have such a terrible video like this(incidently, I do not know what the viewer below is talking about...there is no original version of the \"Ceremony\" video...just this thing). An aweful, unwatchable piece of useless garbage featuring a fellow walking around with a trashbag on his head. I guess that is a reference to the thought process of music video directors. Not sure what else it could be. I could only stomach 40 seconds of this filth. I'm afraid after listening to this tune for more than ten years, both Joy Division's and New Order's...the images in mine and in other musician's heads will have to do. Unwatchable. Trash.  The new \"Tempation\" video....embarrasing.    Watch their concert videos, go see them live or better yet, think for yourself.    There are a few winners...\"Confusion\" is a classic and a great video as well as little bit of music history.    \"Perfect Kiss\" is cool but I've seen it enough and life is short.  \"Touched By the Hand of God\" is very funny..but ..again..life is short.  The only thing I hadn't seen before and actually kind of liked was the Gina Birch \"Crystal\"..that was a slightly cool workday music industry bit. Not important art in anyway....but better than Franz Fernidad peeing on an art gallery wall like the Nazis used to do.    Videos?    As for the documentary on the other disc. This is much better but is almost 13 years old. There are some excellent Joy Division clips here. Why don't we have a full DVD of all the Joy Division footage in the world yet? You get many of the same videos on the other disc played in full again on THIS disco too..in case you're someone like me who hated them enough the first time.  Some great stuff, a bit of live Joy Division, great early live versions of 'Blue Monday\", \"Tempation\"..and yes..\"Ceremony\".  The interviews are great as New Order speaks like real musicians and their collaborators are an interesting bunch making up a lot of what urban nightlife music culture has been from the late seventies until today on both sides of the Atlantic.",

In this story of New York's world-famous Studio 54, the story is told through the eyes of Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young man from New Jersey who manages to get onto the guest list and into the very exclusive club.  A gas station attendant by day, Shane soon finds himself as one of the regulars and manages to secure himself a job at the club as a bus boy/bartender.    Shane befriends two of the club's workers, Greg Randazzo (Brechin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek).  They invite Shane to move in to their apartment, but Greg soon suspects that Shane and Anita are having an affair.  Shane actually has fallen for Julie Black (Neve Campbell), another regular.  A soap opera star, Shane is intrigued by her beauty and is immediately drawn to her.  After a while, the two begin a relationship.    Meanwhile, Steve Rubell, played magnificently by Mike Myers, has been laundering money from the club.  Each night, he sends bags full of money out with the trash to be picked up and taken away, out of sight of the I.R.S.  This scam goes on for quite some time until finally the I.R.S. finds out about Rubell's operation and raids the club.    Shane, spurned in the end by Julie, eventually leaves 54 to become a college student and restaurant manager.  Steve Rubell is sentenced to 18 months in prison and is forced to sell 54 in a plea agreement. He is allowed to remain as a \"consultant\" to the new ownership, and he also throws a big party at the club's re-opening, attended by Shane, Greg, and Anita.    Studio 54 was indeed the king of the discos.  Celebrities from all over the world, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, were regular visitors to the club.  The music was loud, and sex and drugs were freely available. Unfortunately, 54 never really regained its prominence after its re-opening, and it closed down for good in 1986.  Steve Rubell died in 1989 at age 45.      This movie does an excellent job of showcasing the very famous club, right down to the throngs of people who begged to get in each night.  The acting in the film is very good, but Mike Myers stands out above the rest.  His superb portrayal of the eccentric but troubled Steve Rubell is the highlight of the film.    Having grown up in the 70s, I remember reading about Studio 54 and what a fantastic place it was.  This movie shows both the bright and dark sides of the famous disco.  I recommend this movie highly.  If you're a child of the 70s like me, then you'll remember the disco music and the almost surreal essence that 54 had.  Watch this movie and enjoy a trip back to when disco ruled and 54 was the place everyone wanted to go",

After pretty much laughing my (...) off while watching \"The Best Of Will Ferrell\", I expected to do the same with \"The Best Of Will Ferrell - Volume 2\". However, when I watched it on tv in July, I was extremely disappointed. Outside of a few sketches, I hardly uttered a chuckle. However, when I saw this dvd a few weeks ago, I knew I had to buy it, thinking I might change my opinion. Needless to say, it remained the same.    \"The Best Of Will Ferrell - Volume 2\" is supposed to include sketches featuring some of Will's lesser known recurring characters that failed to make it on the (10 million times funnier) first volume, including rude and incompetent obstertrician Dr. Beamen, Hank of Bill Braskie's Buddies\", and Ted Brogan\", the 37 - year - old baby. Also there are some sketches that feature non - recurring bits. None of these sketches are funny.    However, there are a few funny sketches. They are the opening Bush sequence, the famed \"Wake Up And Smile\", \"Lovers\" (though there's another version of this sketch with the same characters on volume one except it's with Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore and it's much funnier), \"Red Ships Of Spain\" (with Will doing his Robert Goulet impression), and \"Inside The Actors Studio\" with Kate Hudson as Drew Barrymore (though the one with Alec Baldwin as Charles Nelson Reilly on the first edition was much funnier).    The only other watchable sketch is \"Janet Reno's Dance Party\", which really only catches fire when she beats up Mayor Rudolph Giulianni. It's pretty good, but Will impersonated Reno 13 times, so there are probably better Janet Reno sketches out there.    Also, there are many much more funnier characters that didn't appear or only appeared briefly on the first volume that without a doubt should have been included here. I'm talking about Frank Henderson (from the \"Get Off The Shed\" bit), David Leary (from \"Dog Show\"), Tom Wilkinson (from \"Morning Latte\"), Sean Patrick Flannery (from the Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches), Baron Nocturna (from \"Goth Talk\"), Don West (from the \"Shopping At Home\" sketches), and his Ted Kaczynski and Neil Diamond (where's \"Storytellers\") impressions.    And why not include more Culps, Spartans, Roxbury, \"Jeopardy!\", Harry Caray and Saddam Hussein sketches? Yeah, they were on volume one, but they were truly Will's best! And as a final gripe, they could have given us at least one of the Bush/Gore presidential debates sketches.    Overall, you can say this is a complete abomination, but it is tempting. Buy at your own risk and hope that volume three comes out soon and it's much, much better than this dvd",

The Snow Queen is an ancient story from Northern Europe about a beautiful lady with a heart of ice who resides near the North Pole, and uses winter to take the lives of innocent human beings, and uses her beauty and charm to seduce innocent men.  Live action movies and cartoon versions of this story have been made in numerous decades in multiple languages.  One of the later ones is this 3 hour version by Hallmark Entertainment.  Taking place somewhere in Scandinavia; most likely Denmark, the setting is a small rural village in the mid 20th century.  A father loses his wife to winter, and raises his daughter at their hotel.  One day, he hires Kai, a young man, to help with labor around the hotel.  He and the daughter fall in love, but the Snow Queen steals Kai away.  The daughter sets forth on a journey across earth and the four seasons to find the lair of the Snow Queen to rescue Kai.      The movie's story is quite good and offers much promise.  But the movie drags too much; the dialogue is often muted, and the Snow Queen is somewhat wooden; not enough emotion.  The idea of a beautiful queen of ice is done much better in the Chronicles of Narnia than here, as Bridget Fonda does not do much talking at all.  The idea of the robbed girl having to travel across the spring, summer and autumn to find Kai is quite innovative and only possible by the crew of Hallmark, but again it was not done well.  The action scenes were somewhat fake, and most importantly, the snow in the winter scenes clearly looked like fake snow.  Overall, a good attempt but a bad result.",

Although they are scrabbling against poverty, living in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia during the Depression, they are happy. The large family, which includes seven children, parents, and grandparents, is loving and supportive. Sure, the kids aren't angels -- like any others, they squabble and have their problems. But when push comes to shove, they've got one another's backs, like when eldest sister Mary Ellen beats up a classmate for mocking little brother Jim Bob's shirt (made from sister Erin's old dress) or when eldest brother John-Boy defends Mary Ellen from a potential assault by a guest staying with the family.    Most gratifying is the children's overall contentment. Sure, they aspire for \"things\" - they long to see a traveling circus that comes to the mountains, and they pause by toys displayed in the general store. But for the most part, they don't dwell upon what they don't have. They take contentment in life in general, and when the occasional treat comes their way, they truly appreciate it...unlike many kids today, whose parents buy them the latest iPods and video games, and it's STILL not enough.     The Waltons' saga is told through the eyes of eldest son John-Boy, who is 17 and aspires to be a writer. He is based on Earl Hamner, a Virginia native who wrote \"Spencer's Mountain,\" the book upon which the show is based. Hamner does a voiceover in each episode, speaking as the adult John-Boy looking back on his childhood.    (For the record, I'm 26 years old, not someone who grew up with this show, or looks down upon \"today's youth\" from the vantage of age. But, as you know, not all young folks are content with the attitudes of today's society as a rule. I, for one, truly wish we could return to a simpler time; it won't be long before our complicated lives lead us to self-destruct.",

They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age!  What other band sounds better 30 years later?    After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly.  Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out.  And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song.    However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song.  NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.  It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show.  The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc.      The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs.  That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show.    Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety.    Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD.    Update 6/14/05:  Exactly a year later, I've still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick's still my favorite band.",

David Cronenberg's \"A History of Violence\" is the type of film that you may not know how will wind up in the end, or what will happen next, but from the chilling starting sequence featuring what is the most violent image of the whole film, you know it's a film that's ready to raise your hairs, maybe for sheer pleasure or maybe because it's an exciting experience. The film probably shouln't be qualified as a thriller, even if it is a thriller and it is full of non cheap thrills and emotions, but as the modernization of westerns. It is, after all, a western. The character portrayed brilliantly by Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, and as the movie unravels we see that's he's no different to the Man with No Name or to Will Kane, for he is just the \"good\" cowboy, the man that we route for, the man that we want shoots the other men. As the movie advances, the plot doesn't thicken or gets more complex. As a matter of fact it's tough finding a plot so simple, yet so compelling and fun. The movie is quite fun, specially for those who like their movies to be charged with mordant black humor, and violence served in both spectacular showdowns and straight shots of blown away faces and blood splattered frames.     The acting is another thing. It is the best acted movie of the year, featuring a sexy and absolutely spectacular Maria Bello, a spooky Ed Harris, who under some makeup seems like a man you don't want to mess with, and William Hurt, in a part no longer than ten minutes, but ten minutes that opaque any other film on the silverscreen. Add to that Cronenberg's direction, which filles every scene with dinamite, and every shot with visual flair and delight.    As the final credits are rolling we get the sensation that this is a flawless film, and as our eyes rehearse it over and over again, we get to the conclusion that this is a flawless film. Some may say that it has no sense and that it is ridiculous, but if you think about it Munich and Syriana, and L'Enfant and Red Eye and Casablanca and almost every other movie made had the same purpose: Just to entertain. That is after all the final purpose of films, and this one succeeds high above the ground. It is also the best thriller, western, comedy and drama that has passed on the screens on a very long time.",

Now don't get the wrong impression of my rating because this is an excellent family show and it gets 5 stars it that area, but the 2 rating is my opinion of the poor way that this quality show was put on DVD.. First i noticed that this is a bare bones transfer with no extras but you would think since we are paying good money for these dvds that they would at least make sure the trasnfer quality from film to dvd is excellent, but sadly its not, it seems like there was not much care taken in the transfer process. Let me explain, during the opening music i noticed that it fades in and out something that i did not notice in the previous 3 seasons. Also on a few episodes i just watched, it appears like there was little cleaning up of the film done before transfer to get rid of all the spots or floaters that sometimes appear on older films, it would have been nice if the time was taken to remaster the film for good dvd viewing. It also would have been nice to include a closed caption feature for the hearing impaired for those who need it. In closing i really enjoy watching the Waltons and I am very pleased to have it on DVD, but if a little more care and extra work was put into the transfer process this could be so much better and i would feel i am getting the most for my money spent...",

            "input": "Apples and Oranges . Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us.  THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.    Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background.  One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving!  Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members.  Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living.  The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of  Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending.  All is not what it seemed: it's better and, well, different.    Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film.  Well worth viewing. Grady Harp, January 0",

            "input": "Many new turns during an overall great season 3! . The Shield is one of those shows I think that will attain even more pop culture status as time goes on, even long after it leaves the airwaves. The show is centered on cops who do corrupt things in order to ultimately put a major smash into the drug and arms trades in Los Angeles. I've spent my reviews of season one and two going in depth on how the camera's angles are unique and how each character has a ton to contribute to the show. This time I'm simply going to tell you little bits and pieces of what is going on with season three, and it will probably not make any difference because if you have already seen one and two, you know you have to go back for more!    Season three tends to get deep in two areas. The one area is the character development. Mackey's ongoing separation from his wife, coupled with finding out his second child is also autistic is a big downer, but besides that he's also laying pipe everywhere east of L.A. so it apparently isn't bothering him as much as he'd like to let on. Things between him and Shane Vendrell start to go south quickly. Shane and Vic were always good friends but as the pressure for the team to produce results as well as keep secrets and stay within boundaries mounts, Vic starts pulling back, starts easing off. This action does a boomerang effect for Shane Vendrell, who launches forward with more reckless abandon on cases than never before!    Despite all the drama in their personal lives (Yes, Julian the African American cop, is still gay, still a devout Christian to the point of fanatically, and still married to a women he's trying to have a child with) the street lives are alive more than ever. Rival Gangs, horrible hit squads, CI's (Confidential Informer) and sting operations happen in a one two three punch combination throughout the series.    Kicking off-season three, we have two gangs who are bad, mad and territorial. They are the Byz Latz and the One-Niners. Oh and did I mention they both acquire massive amounts of MP-5 submachine guns to try and further their struggles?    The Armenian mob of course, is still in the ongoing storyline from season 2, and its not getting pretty. People are still showing up with they're feet cut off, and it looks like they are not going to stop. Where did their money go, and who shot two of their men when it was taken? Oh well, excuse us, we're the Armenian mob, and our money train is gone, so its time to hack off more feet! Speaking of the money train, Vic decided to use some of it in an undercover operation, only to accidentally circulate it back into the drug trade. What Vic doesn't know is that there was someone else watching the Armenians, and slipped in ten thousand dollars worth of MARKED BILLS.    The Strike team is in hot water as well as the \"Decoy Squad\" is now implemented to ultimately take over their job after a trial run. This is how great this series is, you take a bunch of newbies and chuck them into an ongoing plot and all they do is ADD their talent in acting and screen presence to the table. Some interesting heat will come down on the decoy squad, as well as something terrible happening to Juliens former partner Tommy.    The corruption and mystery within the crime community runs deep, but doesn't ever lose us much. On the surface we still are able to keep up with the Strike team walking the line between good cop/bad cop, and gangs galore continue to wreak havoc in the streets. The drama and problems with EACH character continues to mount to the point you think it will crash before winning. Wrong again, these stories are tightly written and really do a good job to keep us intrigued because lets face it, like life, in the Shield you never know what is going to happen next.    The last few episodes are pretty intense. The strike team gets dissolved and Shane gets partnered up with a new guy named \"Army\" (he's an Iraq war veteran). Shane and Vic have a showdown of sorts, which really comes from all of the money issues and changed tactics involved in the money train. Season four will surprise you as well as please you, as it will see the roles of these 2 friends change quickly enough.    Season three starts off a little slow but considering the buildup to the ongoing storylines that are really turning into quite the dramatic and suspenseful mini-epics we hoped they would be, it's well worth the weight. Claudette and Dutch are still there cracking cases every day. Aceveda also appears to be going over the edge and it will be interesting to see if he can ever come back in the future",

            "input": "I worked on this dull \"erotic vampire\" film -- some \"inside scoops\"! . Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' \"exploitation\" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.    Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time.     Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to \"grow\" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.    Mission accomplished.    Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.    Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.    Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.    The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a \"meandering, almost formless script.\"    Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the \"story.\"  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.    All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the \"tragic\" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.    However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.    How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)    I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an \"inside story\" on the making of this film:    We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.    Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a \"class assignment.\"  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.    There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).    NEVER PAY for the \"chance\" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.    Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.    And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was \"originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries,\" but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.    Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.    But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see.",

We have found it compelling viewing with some episodes that used all aspects of cinema so well they went far beyond the usual TV fare.  Watching them all back to back from this box set you can have some quibbles such as unueven character development at times (people do things very much 'out of character' occasionally) and everyone has the same sense of humour (which I've never found in a workplace). But I think these things were more noticeable watching them all at once. In a long series such as this the writers could be forgiven for drifting and forgetting from time to time. The acting is almost uniformly excellent.  I'd like to particularly applaud the packaging of this box set. Its a compact way of presenting 45 disks and is very appropriate to the series -a blue leather folio with files for each season inside.It also has several lavish accompanying booklets. Clever and appropriate marketing.  The price was fine too - reasonable 'per season' cost as sold by Amazon",

            "input": "Trouble Aplenty in a Parallel World . Here we have another parody of the giant robot anime genre (mostly making fun of Evangelion). The basic plot is that a teenage guy sees giant city-smashing robots where no one else does, a mad scientist is convinced that this is evidence of a parallel universe, and the mad scientist sends the guy (along with the mad scientist's daughter) to the parallel universe where (surprise) the guy gets to pilot the giant robots.    This series doesn't take itself too seriously, or try to get into the deeper questions of the meaning of life or anything, but instead tries to tell a simple adventure story (in the format of the typical teen-age guy gets chased around by every girl in sight) of a boy and his giant mecha. The show is only 13 episodes long, but this length suits it well, as to make the series go on longer would just reduce half of the show to filler. The 13 episode format keeps things tight. As far as pioneer animation shows go, this is one of the better ones (my favorite still being Battle Athletes Victory). The animation and character designs are good, and the CGI and traditional animation melds well (for the most part). The action sequences aren't really mind-blowing (except perhaps for some of the early ones in the show {like the one where our protagonist jumps into a fallen Mecha and saves its pilot by destroying the enemy attacking her}).    The music isn't too bad, except for when it's not there (maybe it's supposed to be dramatic or atmospheric, but a few times I found myself getting bored). The characters are all pretty likable (and especially the alternate Mitsaki, one of the nicest, cutest, sweetest, most attractive girls in all of anime), and some of the dialog and situations are pretty funny (although on the whole I'd say that the comedy was largely hit-and-miss).    If you're a fan of Mecha, and particularly Mecha comedies, you should probably give this one a rent at the least. If you like its style it's probably worth a purchase.",

The photography is simply amazing. The flashbacks, dreamlike sequences, & one particularly memorable scene in which Mitchum's stepbrother is seen in the background slowly stalking Mitchum while planning to shoot him are what make this an incredible western. Robert Mitchum plays Jeb Rand, the lone Rand family survivor after a bloody feud. Rescued & raised by Ma Callum (Judith Anderson) he grows up with her two kids: Thor (Teresa Wright) & Adam (John Rodney). Jeb gets along with Thor just great, so great that they fall in love! This doesn't sit well with Adam who never accepts Jeb as a part of the family. Their rivalry only worsens as they grow older, eventually leading to tragic results which tear the family apart. Mitchum commands the screen so well with his amazing performance that he makes acting look easy. This is easily his best western & one of his greatest roles of his career. The chemestry between him & Teresa Wright is one of the best things about this classic. Add Max Steiner's music & you've got one awesome film! And let's not forget the underated Alan Hale, who has a small but memorable supporting role as a friend of Jeb's. Considered as the first psychological western, this is an unforgettable gem that you need to add to your dvd collection",

I understand this movie is made in the same way political ads are, where they try really hard to skew the facts to make the viewer have an emotional reaction to the half of the story that is provided. I think that for most people it is highly effective, but it didn't work for me.  I think this is an excellent movie to show as an example of skew, perspective, and propaganda.    When they talk about the sweatshops in China and Honduras I found myself --though I dont envy the workers-- laughing at the movie.  I used to live in China and I have been to many factories and the conditions that they make seem exclusive are universal over there.  It is the film makers and then the ex-employees (and they are assuming the viewers) who are putting their cultural assumptions about how sad it is that they work so hard and get paid so little, but in other countries that is a fact of life that has nothing to do with Wal-Mart. That is a cultural and governmental problem within the countries where the factories exist, not only a problem with Wal-Mart.    The movie also discuss how Wal-Mart employees are a burden to the government because of the fact that Wal-Mart pays very  little and then suggests that it's employess go on public assitance, but the truth is that is the same for the fast-food companies and everywhere else that pays minimum wage and offers little benefits.     I do believe Wal-Mart should morally proivide their employees with more wages and provide more full-time positions, but that is a business culture that expands well past Wal-Mart. I am a teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours a week so they do not have to give me benefits, but I don't see anyone trying to make movies to ban schools.",

            "input": "\"Turn the Sun Down\": Teen summer fun cartoon with Daria. . I saw the preview of this cartoon on Netflix. Seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach (minus Daria, who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions), I knew I had to buy this. And I love it!     \"Is It Fall Yet?\" deals with the main characters' experiences during Summer vacation. The highlight: \"The Tom Thing\" -as Trent Lane, Jane's musician brother, nicely puts it.  Daria and Tom have fallen in love, and are dating.  Tom and Jane have broken up.  This situation dents the friendship of Daria and Jane.      The two bonus episodes on the dvd (\"Fire\" and \"Dye! Dye, My Darling!\")  show how \"The Tom Thing\" happened.  It's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes FIRST as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of Daria, Jane and Tom that is carried over into the movie.     Adding to Daria's anguish, her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `OK-to-Cry Corral' summer camp.  Working with her are her teachers, dorky Mr. O'Neill and Anthony DeMartino (with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he's very irritated).    The other `Daria' characters have their own situations.  Lovelorn Jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that's out of Lawndale.  Dim-witted lovers Kevin and Brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool.  They only have eyes for each other... and I won't go further than that.  Watch the movie, and see for yourselves!  Daria's spoiled brat sister Quinn and her `Fashion Club' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their PSAT exams.  (How I remember my high school days!  I was a Junior when I took my PSAT exam - and passed it!)  Lead `Fashion Club' member Sandi (with the deep voice) reminds me so much of Khan from Mike Judge's \"King of the Hill\" series.  Like Khan, Sandi is often sullen-expressioned, and complains a lot!     Mack and Jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues'.  Mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor, in a truck, and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream.  His girlfriend Jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office, and is up to her neck in work.  The pair doesn't have time to date.      I love the opening 'beach' number with the `Daria' cast frolicking on the beach... and with Daria not participating, of course. It is reminiscent of the \"Beach Blanket\" 1960's movies with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Jane, too, is seen isolated on another part of the beach, painting. Her isolation gives proof of her rift with Daria.  The song \"Turn the Sun Down\", sung by the female band Splendora (who provide the theme song for `Daria'), is playfully catchy! Splendora sounds like the female version of the Beach Boys. The 'beach' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk, with the frolickers still dancing...followed, in a dissolve, by the \"Daria\" logo in a similar 'dusk' color, with the film's title; and Splendora's melodic singing as the song concludes. This is a nice effect.      Another nice effect is in the dvd's Main Menu, with a scene taken from the opening of the `Daria' t.v. series.  A somber Daria is at the movies.  Her fellow moviegoers, surrounding her, are laughing at the scenes from the opening `Beach' segment. \"Turn the Sun Down\" is played in the background.       At the film's end, there are `Outtakes', which are cute and amusing involving the `Daria' cast.  There are a few gross outtakes also included.    \"Is It Fall Yet?\" got me interested in the \"Daria\" t.v. series.  To admit, Daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on Beavis and Butt-Head\".  I purchased her \"Daria Diaries\" and \"Daria Databases\" books to help me get to know the Lawndale characters.  I'm presently reading her `Diaries'.  And I, too, hope that the complete \"Daria\" series gets released on dvd in the very near future.          But treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at Lawndale with \"Is It Fall Yet?\"  And savor Daria's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes.  A little girl in the film asks camp counselor Daria \"Do you ever smile??\"       The answer is Yes!  And this movie is sure to make you smile.  It's a gem in the \"Daria\" series!",

My watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world. The premise of the film was disturbing to say the least. I have never been a true fan of Charleton Heston who in my opinion always has overacted. However, Edward G. Robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played. His performance was truly heartfelt, bringing to mind the current debate on \"ending one's own life with dignity\". I shutter to think that this is life as it should be though. But Robinson's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him. I found the other actors to be somewhat bland. Perhaps this was acting at that point in time, but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot. The story line was unique, but the script was lacking. A re-make today by Steven Spielberg might be worthwhile seeing. Perhaps the most striking element I took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up",

Despite this movie being as bad as it is, I have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that I have ever had, the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad, that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in Mystery Science Theater fashion. The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like  \"don't be insane!\" and virtually every word to come out of Tara Reid's mouth, but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend Marco and literally 5 people, including myself, couldn't resist the urge to yell \"polo\" at the screen. This is one of those movies that's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art (if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is). It amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie, I can't think of a single use for it, though I can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in Sadam Huisein's palace during operation Iraqi freedom, then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that Saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction",

            "input": "Pretty Woman Meets Toxic Tort . Even though I would agree that \"Erin Brockovich\" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in \"Pretty Woman.\"  I am second to no one in enjoying a good \"David and Goliath\" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the \"true\" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the \"Xena\" character is the main attraction in \"Xena: Warrior Princess\" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).    Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in \"Pretty Woman\" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.    Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired \"work clothes\" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.    Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The \"convenience\" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar \"bonus\" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a \"thanks\" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.     The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.",

            "input": "Pushing the boundaries of traditional documentaries! . Ron Mann is a Canadian filmmaker who specializes in documentaries about alternative culture; be it comic books with Comic Book Confidential, a famous dance craze with Twist or marijuana culture with Grass. His latest film, Tales of the Rat Fink, playfully profiles Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth who helped popularize the customization of cars in the 1950s. Roth saw automobiles as much more than just modes of transportation but rather blank canvasses just waiting to be adorned with his stylish artwork or to be rebuilt from the ground up in his own unique way.    Mann does a fantastic job of taking us back to the `50s with period music and plenty of archival footage. However, his documentary is far from traditional as he has Roth narrate his own life but voiced by actor John Goodman. Mann also gives several classic cars their own voice as they tell their own story and how they contributed to hot rod car culture. It's an unusual move that takes a little getting used to but for those who have seen Mann's other documentaries it is merely a natural progression of his idiosyncratic style - kind of like Roth himself.    Mann animates still photographs and instead of having someone drone on about the different kinds of paint jobs, shows it through stylized animation techniques and footage of cars being customized. Throughout it all, he has Roth's most famous creation, Rat Fink (his answer to Mickey Mouse - a bright green mutant rat - whom he had grown tired of and created a symbol of everything that was cool and dangerous about the hot rod culture), bridges each segment via animated interludes and accompanied by the surf music of the Sadies. Tales of the Rat Fink does an excellent job immersing us in the custom car culture, how it came to be and its distinctive characteristics. This documentary takes a nostalgic look back at a time when cars had their own distinctive look; they were works of art - something that is missing today in our current homogenous culture. Its unorthodox approach may put off some but it does mirror the gonzo the look of Roth's artwork and takes it away from the stuffy confines of traditional documentaries.    \"Big Daddy Lives!\" is a rare, archival interview with Roth who talks about how he designs cars and the criteria he used to do this. This extra provides fascinating insight into the man and his work.    \"Ratfink Reunion.\" To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rat Fink, Roth and Von Dutch did a customized paint job on a car together. It's great to see these two artists doing what they do best.    \"Big Daddy's Garage\" features galleries of his rough sketches for t-shirt designs, stills from the 2006 Detroit Autorama that featured a collection of many of Roth's classic cars, samples from the Rat Fink comic strip, and other artists' interpretation of Rat Fink.    \"Interview with director Ron Mann.\" A friend turned him onto Roth's work in the 1990s and in 2000 he decided to make a film about the man but when he died suddenly in 2001 Mann shelved the project. A few years later, he got the idea to tell Roth's story from the point-of-view of his cars.    \"Deleted Scene\" is a brief clip that shows the Rat Fink merchandise explosion with model kits, t-shirts, hats, etc.    Also included is the theatrical trailer.    Finally, there is a music video for the Sadies who provided the music for the documentary. It's animated and features Rat Fink with members of the band",

The movie begins with the birth of punk, when a small roomful of people were fortunate enough to catch the Sex Pistols when they first came out, changing the course of music, and ends with the death of acid. As Tony Wilson puts it in the film, it is the \"story of Manchester,\" that begins when a group of young and idealistic local boys decide to screw London and its record companies and start producing their own records out of Manchester, and boy, has music history benefited from this decision. It's interesting to note that as these young lads on the forefront of the music scene in Manchester began to age, they become less idealistic as they were in their youth, and more acknowledging of reality and its limits. My only complaint is that I wish the movie could have had more on Joy Division and New Order, than on the Happy Mondays. Why did Tony Wilson ever sign a band that came in last place in Manchester's Battle of the Bands??? The casting for this movie is outstanding, as well.    Two big thumbs up.    P.S.

Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that doesn't automatically make it a great film. I'm not knocking this film, of course not. But there's a lot of parts in it that I didn't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be, it is or what everyone makes it out to be.    Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account. His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he's fired for apparently botching the case. Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that's why he was fired. He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller, a top and famous attorney who is, rather bluntly, very intolerant of gays. So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays.    One small nitpick: it seemed like anyone that is in Andy's family or friends circle is against him. There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him. A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking, complete with sad looking wives. It's nothing that derails the film though. And I don't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme's trademark of looking in the camera. It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks...weird, and maybe a bit too on the nose.    Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case. Hanks, in a way, reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster. Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar. No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington.    Is it a watchable film? Of course, it's quite good and performances are excellent. I don't know whether you should blind buy it though, that's up to you",

I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated.    The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy).    The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor.    The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire).    The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy.    However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.     Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment.    Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.     The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable.    For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy.    I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film.    So, I give it two stars. *Yawn",

The opening song was written and sung by the great Carole King.  It sets the stage for what the Care Bears are all about.  In their clouds and rainbow filled Care-A-Lot, they look down and see children who have stopped caring and need a friend.  Little stars flit about and help them.    The story is about a magician's assistant named Nicholas who finds a magic book with an evil spirit.  Nicholas has always felt lonely.  The evil spirit takes advantage of that, and uses him as a pawn in her scheme to get the world to stop caring.  This is almost too much for the gentle Care Bears.  Luckily, they get some help from a kind lion who lives in the Forest of Feelings with other cute critters.    There are lots of cute songs that make the whole film touching and delightful.  As far as this being a feature-length commercial, the only thing that smacks of commercialism is when more and more Care Bear Cousins keep popping out of the woodwork with no character development or dialouge.

            "input": "Musically Thrilling, but Video Record of this Immaculate Show a little disappointing . I remember this show very well.Just as the sun dipped out of sight the stage lights went on and the band blasted into \"Pearly Queen\" and \"Medicated Goo\" and it was like muscial heaven hearing this stuff actually played live (after hearing it so many times on CD). The only way to really experience TRAFFIC is live and this tour was the last chance to do that (now that Wood and Capaldi are both gone).  TRAFFIC's sound remains unique, its never really been imitated. And this band has never received much radio attention (save the occasional  \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\") and though everyone knows who Steve Winwood is, a lot of people still don't know TRAFFIC's music. But thats fine with me, they are like a well kept secret and this allowed us fans to be able to actually afford tickets to see them when they came through our towns in the summer of '94.  Another advantage of this bands notoriety-lesness is that none of these songs sound dated. In fact much of the TRAFFIC catalogue (with the exception of a few psychedelic numbers on their first two albums)sounds timeless (I'm thinking here especially of the JOHN BARLEYCORN and WHEN THE EAGLE FLIES albums). Masterfully played and highly evocative folk and jazz as well as good ol' blues-based rock does not date. Hearing these styles played next to each other as well as mixed together is as exciting as music gets. I must say,though, that the sole number played from their new album FAR FROM HOME called \"Mozambique\" sounds a bit too much like SANTANA. That doesn't mean its not a good song and I love SANTANA but it didn't make me want to buy FAR FROM HOME.      I was not a first generation TRAFFIC fan but I became interested in the band in the early 90's so this tour came along at just the right time for me. I've never been a Steve Winwood fan and his solo stuff just seems weak and souless to me. I would say his solo stuff sounds like a watered down radio friendly TRAFFIC or a TRAFFIC without the imagination but to my ears his solo stuff just doesn't sound like TRAFFIC at all.  With the SPENCER DAVIS GROUP and with BLIND FAITH (and a live DVD of BLIND FAITH is now available as well) and especially with TRAFFIC, however, Winwood made music that is absolutely unique and has that unforgettable magic to it that few folk/rock/jazz/blues groups or groups of any kind ever capture.     This was really a great show, and the art work that was displayed behind the band was perfect, mysterious and a bit surreal though in a very appealing way, so the show was evocative to the ear and the eye.   Plus it was summertime, outside, and a river flowed quietly behind the stage as the band played.  I don't think I stopped grinning through the whole set.     That said I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD as it just didn't match my own memory of this show.  The filmmaking here is just plain amateurish so as a collection of great songs this works, but as a concert artifact I think its much less succesful.  That amateurism might have worked had the filmmakers simply employed handmade cameras for that would have created an improvised spontaneous feel to go along with the spontneous improvised music. The filmakers should have taken a more subdued, as well as maybe a bit more avant-garde approach, but, instead, the filmamkers got busy and decided to decorate or trash a perfectly good concert video with some unforgivably cheesy and painfully obvious special effects and visual metaphors (traffic lights, time-lapse highway travel, traffic)which were nowhere near as subtle and evocative as the graphics that adorned the stage. These 'special' effects were just not that special, and they give the video all of the visual mystery and excitement of a local televison commercial.  The idea, apparently, was to share with the DVD audience the feel of traveling with the band but the filmmakers seem to forget that what we want to watch over and over is not the interviews and sound bites and jump-cuts to band members getting on tour buses or hanging out in hotel rooms(unless its a band that is doing something that we want to see like say the Stones in '72 ) but these guys when offstage just seem like ordinary guys who are not really interested in tearing it up. The music itself is what counts, the musicians say so themselves, and thats what we want too, the music. Lets face it Winwood is a genius onstage (so long as he's surrounded by great players that allow him to jam) but a dynamic off-stage presence he's not, so he's just not that interesting to follow around. Capaldi, on the other hand, has great camera presence and his character and humor really come across. His mugging for the camera is on occasion pretty funny. But, on several occasions, the filmakers cut-away from musical jams in progress in order to give us more of this stuff and this is sheer madness. When you buy a live album or a live DVD (especially one of a band that is known for its awesome jam potential) the one thing that you do not want is for those jams to be interrupted or edited or interefered with in any way. This music is sacred so light up, enjoy, and leave it alone. Really not cool of the vidoegraphers to cut-away mid-jam ever for any reason!  Note to future concert vidoegraphers: keep camera focused on the band, watching them play is plenty of entertainment. If you want to cut-away occasionally to show crowd shots thats fine so long as its a shot of a dancing girl soaking-up-the-music-and-sun, but no cut-aways that involve cutting songs short (as these filmmakers do in the middle of \"Glad\"). Also probably would have been best to leave Jerry Garcia out of the \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" sequence, Jerry just wasn't feeling the song, so why do we need to watch Jerry not Feelin' all that Alright. I love Jerry but I don't want a video record of this particular moment which was not one of his best.     I am guessing that this DVD was the work of more than one filmmaker because occasionally it does achieve that ground level and grassroots feel that we want from a live performance that we attended and have more than fond memories of.  Of course the people we see at the concert on this video are not the ones we saw when we were there (our own absence from the procedings is maybe why concert videos always seem to be mssing some key ingredient) but it is nice to be reminded that part of the concert experience is what happens before the show, and what happens offstage in the audience during the show while sitting on the grass among strangers who are nonetheless feeling the vibe along with ya.     No better show opener than \"Pearly Queen\" and no better show closer than the TRAFFIC version (complete with long drum build up) of \"Gimme Some Lovin'\".....lots of good stuff inbetween as well...\"40,000 headmen\" & \"John Barleycorn\".....    At the show I saw I do seem to remember hearing \"Empty Pages\" and \"Dream Gerard\" in addition to the rest of the set list on this DVD. So, what's up videographers?    By the way these performances sound virtually identical to the live versions of these songs on WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN and that is not a bad thing since that is one of the best live albums I've ever heard. If you are new to TRAFFIC and don't really want or need a concert DVD but want to experience the live TRAFFIC then WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN is the way to go. CANTEEN has \"Pearly Queen\" and \"Medicated Goo\" as well as \"40,000 Headmen\" and \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" and Gimme Some Lovin'\" but it also has three Dave Mason songs so you get \"Feelin' Alright\", \"Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave\", and \"Sad and Deep as You.\"",

I'm writing this paragraph due to the other somewhat negative views on the rape scene.  After watching the girls culled by training over years (a few drowned youngsters are even pulled from the surf), killed in testing by guards, culled again to half in the open dormitory scene in which each girl must kill another to leave the building, culled yet again to three in weaponed combat, and lots of males, guards and targets, killed by assassins, some reviewers think that a rape scene is just too darn much.  That's a reflection of our modern society of the disposable male and protected female - all under the guise of gender equality.   Apparently, it's now socially acceptible to kill as many men as you want, especially on assassin assignment.  This movie has at least two scenes killing a naked man during a massage.

It's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I'm compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the \"War between the States\" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn't really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey",

I don't want to call anyone silly, or a THIEF for pirating movies,(just look at the reviews, you'll find him) but just so everyone (and certainly someone in particular) who complains about this Columbia dvd not being widescreen understands, this move WAS NEVER MADE IN WIDESCREEN!  The first widescreen movie in America was \"The Robe\", released in 1953.  Do a little research before you start bashing film noir (minor) classics like this Bogart picture.  There were NO WIDESCREEN MOVIES BEFORE 1953!  Now as for this dvd.      I Thought the transfer showed very little wear.  All-in-all Columbia did a very nice job here of cleaning up the print.  My only complaint with Columbia is how pricey they seem to think their dvd movies are.  Still, this is a good pot-boiler drama, and Bogart is the best.  I can leave or take Lizabeth Scott in this role as the femm fatalle, another leading lady might've been better; she's not a bad actress, I just prefer a lot of other leading ladies of that time period; she does have a certain bad girl sex-appeal that helps her performance.      If you're not familiar with the story, Bogart plays Rip Murdock, an ex-G.I. returning from the war who suddenly finds himself trying to clear his war-buddy of a murder rap, and then solve his friends murder.  Bogarts character tangles with the dark underworld, mixing it up with killers and a lovely blonde.  This movie has a nice, dark feel to it.  Not as dark as say, \"In A Lonely Place\" (also Columbia), but still very nice.    I liked this film enough to put out the money, and if you are an honest person who loves old Bogey pictures, then you'll put out the money as well.  Do all of us honest people a favor, don't help drive up the cost of dvds by supporting pirating like some other goofball suggests.

In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like \"In The Mood For Love\" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either.    So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including \"Happy Together\" and \"Fallen Angels\" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's \"Breathless\", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory.    The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate.",

Not to be confused with `The Hunted' (2003) directed by William Friedkin.    `The Hunted' (1995) stars French actor Christopher Lambert as Paul Racine, American businessman on trip to modern-day Nagoya, third-largest city of Japan, who happens to witness the killing of a woman by black-masked ninjas. The cult ninja group is actually led by a charismatic leader, Japanese named `Kinjo' who is played by a Chinese actor John Lone, and they begin to search Paul to kill. At the end of the film Paul, an ordinary businessman, proves to be an equal match when fighting against martial arts master Kinjo with a Japanese sword. If you can believe this ridiculous story, you can believe anything.    I can happily ignore all the cultural inaccuracy in films as long as they give me something entertaining, but unfortunately it was not the case with `The Hunted,' of which story slowly follows a beaten path of the genre to the unexciting climax. Moreover, to handle a Japanese sword you need certain kind of gracefulness, which Tom Cruise in `The Last Samurai' managed to acquire after many months' hard training. Lambert et al. show no such thing. He and other ninjas just use them fast and furious, but with no grace and consequently, impact at all. Instead the film substituted the grace of Japanese sword fighting for needless bloody violence, and its pinnacle is the pointless terrorism of the ninjas in the bullet train. This is an insult to Japanese culture, for a ninja could be a spy or an assassin, but he is never a terrorist who would kill innocent passengers.    But the most damaging is the way how the film treats women, who are there to be used for sex scenes. Watching Joan Chen in a Japanese bathtub with Christopher Lambert was something I never expected to see, and it surely represents the attitudes of some (if not all) Hollywood films towards women. And it is not surprising to see the film's director is J. F. Lawton, whose biggest hit is Julia Roberts' `Pretty Woman' (as a writer).    By some distributors (who must have been shocked to know the film's awful content after buying the right) really released this Universal film theatrically in Japan. Since then it has been a cult film for avid Japanese film fans, who take this film as sort of comedy. Really. In addition to the ridiculous casting and the laughable scene where Chris and Joan make love in Japanese bathtub that looks as if made 200 years ago, it has plenty of things that make us laugh - a sweet little girl in pachinko parlor, a kind of gambling place (What is she doing there?); a flight attendant-like female assassin in the bullet train (Come on, it's a train, not an airplane!), and the banging Japanese taiko (drum) concert in the garden of a Nagoya hotel (You just cannot sleep!). Even though this is an action flick, it needs some degree of plausibility, which it totally disregards. And there are poorly done actions, which is another reason that makes me regard `The Hunted' as the Universal Pictures have temporarily stepped into the Ed Wood's Grade-Z territory",

The original Jaws is a classic peice of film history and the second, although not as deep or well paced, is still a great film with a fairly well written plotline. This movie, on the other hand, is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover...at sea world! Who would ever think to incorporate SEA WORLD into the Jaws franchise??? Seriously, It was just a horrible idea! The whole, \"Mother Shark lost her baby shark\" scenario is just weird...I don't even think that Shark's raise there \"pups\" once they are born...they just swim away. Not that this is that much different than the plot in Jaws 2, where a \"relative\" shark of the first Jaws decides to go after Cheif Brody and his kids...cheesy, but still, more fun and overall a better storyline. This movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-D graphics add a overly grainy, aged look to the film. The acting is horrendous. Dennis Quaid is OK, but everyone else is just plain awful. Also, who has ever heard of a shark that could break underwater glass? Who OK'd a glass type in an underwater seaworld structure that could be broken by a shark's nose hitting it 3 times??? That's not too safe in my opinion. This is just a bad, bad movie.

Beatings, whippings, gang raping of women prisoners, dipping naked women into vats of lime, hanging the young blonde star nude and upside down over a box of live rats!  I mean, hey you \"sicko\" Nazi fans, is this something or what?    There are no actual hard core sex scenes, however, there are multiple simulated sex scenes that are quite hot to watch.  I think there is significant sexual tension in scenes throughout this very good storyline.  If you are into the whole \"Nazi sex slave camp\" thing....this is by far, the best of that genre I have come across.  And because I only paid $9.99 for this double feature...it makes it a 5 star film for me by all catagories.    I am curious if there is an unrated or extra cut film out there of this, as another reviewer hinted at?  If so, and they showed more actual sex, that would be the one to purchase",

Once again, Lambert paints a disturbingly dark and morbid picture in part two of this horror movie series.      Basically, the plot centers around a young boy played by Edward Furlong who is absolutely devastated by his mother's grisly demise...naturally, he would do anything to get his mother back and eventually does.  The basic premise behind this movie appears to be that the evil force behind the pet sematary is calling upon Furlong's character to resort to the pet sematary to bring back his mother along with some incredible evil as well.    Overall, the movie works a good bit like the original and while it is certainly an entertaining enough movie for horror movie fans, the sequel is not nearly as effective as the original.  One strong area that the original \"Pet Sematary\" had was the very interesting character of Jud played very well by Fred Gwynne...Jud's character carries the momentum of each scene in the original and basically made \"Pet Sematary\" work, but we don't have that strong character presence to make the wheels go round in this sequel, therefore the movie comes across flat.  What we do have in this sequel is an average horror movie that attempts to cash in on the success of the original classic.      Perhaps, the characters in \"Pet Sematary II\" are just weak in general (no disrespect to Clancy Brown or Anthony Edwards), but something is missing here in part two of this series despite the similarities in the dark and disturbing atmosphere painted so meticulously by Lambert.  Quite frankly, I did not like the casting of Edward Furlong as the main character to begin with...I don't know but it just left a bad taste in my mouth about this movie...he's such an uncharasmatic dork and his hard to sympathize with, notwithstanding the obvious limitations of his acting abilities.      The bottom line is that due to the lack of quality characters present in \"Pet Sematary Two\", the sequel just isn't near as compelling as the original.  Because \"Pet Sematary Two\" isn't anywhere near as good, nor as emotionally compelling as the original classic.  Indeed, one is left to wonder if a sequel was a smart move here.  Still, with that being said, \"Pet Sematary Two\" is not a terrible movie and so I give it TWO STARS which means it's just fair or average, but I would be remiss if I did not say that I've certainly seen a lot worse...just check out some of my other reviews and see what I mean.",

            "input": "MUCH better than expected . After reading the reviews I thought the DVD was going to be horrible, but it's actually pretty good, and so far one of the best instructional hip-hop videos I've seen (I own a Groovaloos DVD and Tina Landon DVD and have used Darrin's Dance Grooves), and the instruction is also better than some teachers I've taken classes from.      In general, nothing beats actually having a good teacher and choreographer so they can critique your form and technique.  However, I very happy that the instructor, Dave Scott, DID give some tips on technique instead of only showing moves to copy.  (The fundamentals section is too short, but pretty good).  I only wish he gave more tips on technique.    He also breaks down routines at different tempos (which most instructional videos do not do), and this is essential!  I think it's important to get the fundamental moves right at a slower tempo first, rather than rushing through the movements just to get through the song.      He does turn around from the camera a few times so you can follow the moves without confusing your left and right, but I wish he did that more.      The only main problem I had is that there are only two real routines you can learn, and that's it's not very \"Take it to the Streets\" oriented.  No breakdancing instruction, really, or street dancing tips.  So if you want to improve your breakdancing, this isn't the best DVD to buy.    Overall, it's a good DVD for the price and I would highly recommend for intermediate to advanced dancers looking to expand creative moves, improve their ticking/waving, and get ideas for choreography.  For beginners, it would still be a good investment but will be fairly difficult.  I would suggest that instead of matching the moves, it might be good to just mirror the instructor so you can at least get used to moving your body in certain ways.",

            "input": "Not So Super . In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.    Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:    Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.    Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.    Once said \"continent\" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.    Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?    Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.    The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.    Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!    I could have made a better movie with my camera phone.",

            "input": "Rare collection of early cinema at a very good price . This set consists of 40 short films and series photographs shot between 1894 and 1913. Arranged in roughly chronological order, with the earlier pieces subdivided into categories (\"Edison Kinetoscopes,\" \"Lumiere Films,\" \"Actualities\"), they present an overview of the early silent era of motion pictures. Most people have seen stills or excerpts from such films as \"A Voyage to the Moon\" and \"The Great Train Robbery,\" but seldom have people had the chance to experience such pioneering works in their entirety. This is not a disc for everybody. Only those who have a keen interest in the development of motion pictures at their earliest phase will appreciate it. If you are one of those, like me, consider this a must buy.     In addition to scripted comedies and dramas, there are a number of films that simply record everyday life at the turn of the last century. There is \"Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat\", which is said to have panicked early audiences who failed to grasp that the approaching train wasn't going to come through the screen and run them over. Other films, such as \"Snowball Fight\" and \"Seminary Girls\" are staged with the intent of creating the appearance of spontaneity. Either way, these rarely seen films are important documents of a recent past that is so different from our present that it's hard to believe that they were shot only a century ago.     The Dolby Digital mono sound is clear and well presented. Many of the films are tastefully scored with newly recorded piano music, while others are paired with period recordings. \"Skyscrapers of New York City From North River,\" for example, is particularly haunting when viewed with its mysterious, unidentified musical accompaniment drifting from the speakers. A good number of films in this collection date back to the 1890's, and a lot of them are a lot better looking than I would have thought. Some films, like Train Robbery, even have their original hand painted color tints intact. One of the neat things about the DVD is the freeze frame, because I was able to spot a single frame in one of the Kinetiscope films that was slipped in to read \"Copyright 1907 T.A. Edison.\" This is not a disc that's about features, other than being able to zip from film to film versus fast forwarding on VHS, nor is it one to show off your home theatre.

It starts out bad from the beginning - with an on-screen title sequence dating this film \"In the Near Future\", which should trip alarms for anybody whose ever watched an episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".  The heroes of our story - three pilots assigned to fly hyper-tech US fighters called \"Talons\" - are reluctantly joined by a fourth pilot, a robotic fighter jet called EDI.  Trouble starts immediately when EDI develops an acute case of self-awareness and faster than you can say \"I'm sorry Dave, I really can't do that\", EDI is ignoring orders and raising all sorts of havoc.  It's hard to get more specific without ruining the plot...because there really isn't any plot.  The story we see on the screen hints at several different plot-ideas that never form into a single story - we have the plot about stopping \"Crazy EDI\"; the plot about the evil admiral played by Sam Shepard who will do anything he can to keep the lid on EDI when he goes bad; we have Jessica Biel as a fighter pilot running from the bad guys after she's shutdown over North Korea; then we have Josh Lucas as the other Talon pilot whose on the run from some goons who are trying to...Oh, who cares?  None of these plots go anywhere.    BUT WHAT ABOUT THEM EFFEX?? \"Stealth\" offers us hours of aerial dogfighting in unsurpassed CGI - unsurpassed because the movie demonstrates that there are some things that simply can't be left to computer animation.  Even though they're next generation aircraft, the F/A-37 Talon fighters never convincingly look like any airplanes, and the aerial effects here look little more believable than those done over 20 years ago in \"Firefox\" or \"Deal of the Century\", or nowadays on any flight simulator game run on any desktop-PC.  The effects compound the error by maximizing use of \"impossible shots\" - shots that couldn't be seen by a human perspective, such as those that cut across the sky and directly inside the subject aircraft - it's a clever shot, but not a terrible smart one (they never stop reminding us that these are effects).  It's probably too much effort to explain that even elite fighter pilots don't want to be confused by a flight panel that suddenly starts broadcasting real-time images of a bunch of terrorists sitting down as if for a CNN foto-op, or that none of the pilots come off as even casual aviators.  \"Stealth\" is one of those mindless movies that effete snobbish reviewers like to blame on teenage boys, but this flick lost a ton of money (stealthy profits) which is only strong proof that the monster audience of mindless boys is itself a delusion of these frustrated critics and studio execs, or even stronger proof that those mindless teenage boys may be smarter than anybody realizes",

This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness;  the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal \"values\"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to \"freshen\" its stale storyline.    At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives \"intellectually\" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, \"alternative\" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young.    This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him.    By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his \"alternative\" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection.    Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally.    To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their \"performances\" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed.    In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony.",

Boy meets girl,  boy takes girl out to deliver milk,  boy loses girl,  boy finds girl, boy marries girl and boy leaves for war.  Vincente Minnelli was the perfect choice for directing this, he uses New York as a character that works against them,  but Boy and Girl make it through and marry.  It is a lovely love story.  Robert Walker is very sweet in it too.  Also Judy has a crying jag in almost every one of movies,  and this is the best/saddest crying scene.  Also look for Roger Edens (her mentor) playing the piano in the restraunt scene.  It is a must for all Judy Garland fans and those who love a good love story",

For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.    There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.    My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.

            "input": "Triple-Feature Delight! . The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of my favorite stories, and this DVD contains two excellent film versions-- three, if one counts the Bugs Bunny Jekyll-Hyde animated short, which is definitely a bonus!  The Audio Commentary is also an excellent feature, as it delivers a lot of fascinating information regarding both versions featured on this DVD as well as the John Barrymore version from the 1920's.  Now for the main features:    The 1930's version with Fredric March is highly entertaining, and although it certainly fits the mold of a \"creature feature,\" it carries with it an intelligence that distinguishes it from a typical monster flick.  Fredric March himself is excellent in the dual role of the saint-like (and eventually tortured) Dr. Jekyll and the initially humorous, but ultimately horrifically sadistic Mr. Hyde.  The ape-like Hyde make-up in this film is excellent, especially for its time, but the transformation sequence is even more impressive, as it is done fairly realistically.  Also, the film sticks to the basic storyline, and the use of the fiance/dancer dichotomy adds an interesting twist to the \"strange case.\"  This is a must-see for all fans of horror movies, especially those who enjoy classic horror films.    The 1940's version of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde with Spencer Tracy is also a highly entertaining and excellent film.  There are those who do not consider this a horror film-- I would have to disagree with them completely.  Although this film is a rather lush production of the Jekyll/Hyde story, Spencer Tracy's Hyde ends up being rather horrific in his character, all because of an effective portrayal by a more-than-capable actor.  He (Tracy) manages to add a more humorous touch to both personalities (Jekyll and Hyde), and his Jekyll seems genuinely exhausted from the numerous misdeeds of his alter ego.  As for the Hyde make-up, it is considerably more human-looking than the Fredric March version, but this does not make it any less effective.  In keeping with the tradition of the 1930's version, Tracy's Hyde begins as a somewhat more brutish-looking man who bears relatively little resemblance to the actor, but gets increasingly hideous as the film progresses; as his deeds get worse and worse, this Mr. Hyde becomes exactly what he's meant to be: a monster, both in character and appearance.  True, Mr. Hyde may not be a typical role for actor Spencer Tracy, but his excellent performance shows that he is far from miscast.  Also, this version follows the basic story format as well, which qualifies it as a good adaptation of the original story.    This DVD is an excellent buy, and any purchaser will definitely get more bang for his or her buck!",

Without doubt the Touching Evil series is, along with Prime Suspect, Wire in the Blood (also with Robson), one of the finest mysteries ever developed for television. Once again British television leaves its Stateside counterpart in the dust when it comes to creating a well-reasoned, educated yet infinitely watchable &quot;who-done-it?&quot;       Robson Green's Creegan has a intensity that is deeply affecting and eminently watchable. Just shy of being over-the-edge, Creegan is instantly likeable yet worrisome; like an old friend whom one is justifiably concerned about. Yet he's not so &quot;out there&quot; that we find it difficult to identify with him. Quite the opposite.       Nicola Walker is his perfect partner, D.I. Taylor. Like the best entertainment, Touching Evil isn't a one man show and while the major burden may fall to Robson, he is surrounded with a rich and varied supporting ensemble with a genuinely stand out performance from Shuan Dingwell as D.C.

            "input": "Too sentimental, but beautiful... Wonderfully erotic and surprisingly moving... . Widely acclaimed for his serious ambitions and his uncompromising perfectionism, Stanley Kubrick has won for himself a unique degree of artistic freedom...    Based on a true story of a slave revolt in 73 B.C., Dalton Trumbo's script mixes the melodrama with some quite moving moments... The film depicts the Roman era, the brutality of the slave system, gladiator combat and the decadence of Roman senators... What emerges from the screen was a passionate statement on behalf of freedom and men who were willing to die to overthrow oppressive governments...    The credit for the film's style belongs to Stanley Kubrick, who handled scenes of intimacy and scenes of gigantic sweep with equal attention, illustrating the violence, brutality and corruption of both, the masters and the slaves, raising the question of freedom which justify the human cost...    Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus the idealistic noble slave who believes he must struggle forever against tyranny and just by opposing tyranny he inspires his followers with his example...    Spartacus' character, from a violent primitive rebel who hamstrung a foreman with his teeth, into a gladiator who fought desperately for life in the arena, into an enraged rebel who drowned his gladiator trainer in a huge caldron of soup, into a revolutionary who was able to unite an amorphous mass of slaves, and deserters into a force which succeeded to defeat Rome's best trained armies, into a charismatic leader (with a vision) who forces a long-awaited revolt against the Roman empire...    Two political rivals (Crassus and Gracchus) use the slave uprising threat to manipulate the Roman senate for their own ends:     Crassus (played powerfully by Laurence Olivier) extorts 'a fee,' the dictatorial post of First Consul, Commander of all the legions of Italy as his price for releasing Rome from Spartacus... Crassus sees the defeat of Spartacus' army as a chance for him to seize power of the empire for himself...     Crassus tries to make the slaves betray Spartacus... He tries to win the love of Varinia, not merely to possess her, but as a form of victory over Spartacus... In his last confrontation with Spartacus, he is seen losing all his delusions of grandeur as he stands deeply wounded by the total disregard in which Spartacus holds him...    The screen legend Charles Laughton plays, with expertise, Gracchus, a generous Roman politician, soft and rich, able to get his Julius Caesar (John Gavin) elected leader of the Praetorian Guard to annoy Crassus' ambitions...    The first hour of \"Spartacus\" contains many of the film's best moments : The operation of the gladiatorial school and its training program is impressive and also expressive... The gladiators school is tough but fair... The men are oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged and trained to fight... They are never allowed to kill... For their good performances, they are even rewarded with the companionship of a young lady...    In this degrading manner Spartacus meets Varinia (Jean Simmons-lovely as ever) and it is his love for her and his hatred for his captors that inadvertently sparks off an uprising and the gladiators break out...    Particularly effective is the scene in which Crassus and his \"capricious over-painted nymphs\" (Nina Foch & Joanna Barnes) ask to be entertained by the sight of two pairs fighting to the death...    The scene summarizes the injustice of the situation, the cruelty of bondage and the insurrection becomes a triumph easy to understand...    Nominated for six Academy Awards, and winning for Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Supporting Actor--Peter Ustinov, the motion picture contains no chariot races and no orgies but it still imparts the grandeur and the decay of ancient Rome...    With a stirring musical score by Oscar nominee Alex North, \"Spartacus,\" masterfully directed by Kubrick, is too sentimental, but beautiful, wonderfully erotic and surprisingly moving...",

Soon after the murderers begin dying violent and mysterious deaths.     Dean Martin plays a ramblin' gambler in FIVE CARD STUD, a movie that probably didn't, but certainly could have, pounded the fatal nail into the traditional western before handing the franchise over to the Italians.  Although it sells itself as a mystery/western - who's killing all these gambling varmints, anyhow? - a five-second study of the movie's poster will pretty much shuffle out who's the good guy, who's the bad guy, and who's going to ride into the sunset with Inger Stevens.       I watched this movie the first time years and years ago, back in the knee-britches days.  It's possible some of synapses fired and connected and I somehow, after a generation plus, remembered how the plot - and I use that term loosely - ran.  I doubt it, though.  FIVE CARD STUD doesn't bother itself with keeping an edge to the mystery.  Robert Mitchum plays a gun-toting preacher who opens a church soon after the lynching occurs, Roddy McDowell is an angry young man with a chip on his shoulder.  Katherine Justice plays the shapely tomboy sister of McDowell and Inger Stevens is wasted, again, as a hair-cutting floozie.  Both women, of course, have lips puckered for the six-shootin' gambling man Martin.     This one was pretty excruciating, and it's really tempting to blame it all on the bored, and boring, Martin.  That's probably not fair, though.  The script is murky, the dialogue laughable (at the wrong times,) and, like I said, the mystery is never all that much of a mystery.  Martin, like Mitchum, was best in movies that let him play it laid-back and coolly bemused.  He needs manic energy to react to - think Shirley MacLaine, a young Sally Fields, or even Jerry Lewis.  He doesn't have the chops to carry a movie without someone like that, though.  Mitchum could, but the movie doesn't put him at the center.  It wouldn't matter anyway, because the only hope for this trite oater would be razing the story and starting over.  About the only fun this one provides - besides a scene with Mitchum and Yaphet Kotto near the end - is trying to decide who looks more bored, Martin or Mitchum.  My money's on Mitchum, but Martin gives him a go at it.  A waste of a good cast, and, save for a scene or two, a waste of a viewer's time.",

At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of \"Mississippi Burning\" or the anger and impunity of \"Ghosts of Mississippi\", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade \"Miss Congeniality\" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not \"a powerful film.\" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like \"Mississippis Burning,\" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies",

            "input": "Oh the humanity! . No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. \"Carrie\" is probably the best example, followed by \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Dead Zone.\" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.    \"Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return\" introduces us to Hannah (Natalie Ramsey), a young lady heading back to the now infamous Gatlin, Nebraska in order to answer some important personal questions: why am I drawn to a town out in the sticks? Who is my mother and where is she? Will accepting this role in a schlock, straight to video clunker enhance my career opportunities? You can quickly grasp the metaphysical importance of such ponderings. In quick succession, Hannah runs into a string of problems. Pushy town cop Cora (Alix Koromzay) gives her sass before she even arrives in town. Doc Michaels (Stacy Keach), the town quack, insists on imprinting his own weird impressions on the girl. But the most bizarre occurrence confronting Hannah during her first visit to Gatlin is the sight of a short man hooked up to a slew of machines in a hospital. This figure is none other than Isaac (John Franklin), the original apostle of \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\" in the first film. Apparently, the boyish preacher did not perish at the end of \"Children of the Corn,\" although it sure looked like it then, but slipped into a deep coma that has rendered him helpless for all these years. The arrival of Hannah, however, fulfills an old prophecy that will see Isaac out of his coma and possibly bring about a reemergence of the corn demon.    As \"Children of the Corn 666\" progresses, not so much in a linear manner but in a serious of jerky fits and starts capable of inducing whiplash in the viewer, more of the \"storyline\" emerges for our consumption. It appears that many worshippers of \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\" survived the Peter Horton induced apocalypse at the end of the first film and grew up. They've been waiting all these years--raising their own children and acting like responsible adults--for Isaac to awaken from his slumber and call forth the demon. Why? I don't know. Since cult members always considered anyone over the age of eighteen the enemy, I can't imagine why grown people would welcome the malevolent corn god with open arms. Wouldn't he just pop up out of the earth and rip every person with age wrinkles and five o'clock shadow into bloody pulp? The whole subplot involving Hannah's reunion with her mother Rachel (Nancy Allen) withers when confronted with fundamental questions the movie refuses to ask, let alone answer. It should go without saying that numerous individuals find the idea of a possible Isaac/corn devil reconciliation an unpalatable situation. These are the people who end up on the wrong end of scythes and other sharp objects.    What we have here is such a mess of a film that it easily ranks as the worst entry in the franchise. So many characters parade past the screen, from Gabriel (Paul Popowich) to Jake (William Prael) to a dozen others that it's impossible to keep it all straight. Only the presence of the attractive Natalie Ramsey and the very gorgeous Sydney Bennet in the role of cranky Morgan help keep this film down on stomachs made queasy with banalities. John Franklin, who also co-wrote the script, doesn't do much beyond what he did in the first film. Sure, he issues the usual biblical mumbo jumbo pronouncements to adoring audiences, but his middle age mug and rougher voice tell us this isn't the Isaac we remember from the first film. Is it possible for the chief apostle of a demon to collect Social Security checks, particularly when said demon makes it a point to hype the virtues of youth? Like I wrote earlier, there are more questions here than answers. By the time the film shudders to a halt, all I could bring myself to praise was the gore, and there is precious little of that floating around compared to other entries in the series.    The DVD contains no extras, which is just as well because that would require the viewer to spend more time with this no account film. I suggest you skip, forget, overlook, reject, condemn, avoid, cast off, jettison, exile, dump, burn, pass over, disregard, denounce, discard, and abandon \"Children of the Corn 666\" as quickly as possible. Rearrange your sock drawer, change the furnace filters in your house, or reattach those plastic thingies to your shoelaces--do anything you can think of to avoid this atrocity. If you must see it, good luck and may god be with you.",

I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.      Riveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, \"a tour through hell.\"  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.    During the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn't depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.    All of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.    I felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn't close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.    The film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.    Overall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.    All in all this is an 5 star film",

I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was \"Big top Pee-Wee\", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.    In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.    The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.    The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.",

            "input": "Personal truths and loyalties . I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives - a lively debate.  There were so many brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing out \"Helpful\" votes (to both positive & blisteringly negative reviews) like they were candy.  The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.    The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of \"Blue Lagoon\" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.    I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.    Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that \"historical accuracy\" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.    One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, \"No one dies of sorrow.\"  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in \"Angels in America\" says, \"The body is the garden of the soul.\"  Sorrow is worth full attention.    The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply \"good\" or \"bad\"; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.    Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.    May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.    Compare Caravaggio's \"Judith Beheading Holofernes\" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions",

Smiley and former WWII Circus/MI6 colleague,Alisa Brimley(played with characteristic acumen by Glenda Jackson)are heroes of \"the greatest generation\". In their nation's \"finest hour\",they fought and won against forces of barbarism and EVIL. But TODAY the Murder of Quality...in resentment;pettiness;and politics of envy and entitlement...sweeps across The Western World. John Le Carre's British Public School epic dramatically comprises consequences of \"living\"-off heroism and sacrifice of others while wallowing in Hollow man/woman self-pity and(ironic to the max!)self-apotheosis.(7 stars)",

After watching this film I realized that the legendary 80's mega-flop \"Howard the Duck\" was almost twenty years ahead of its time. There's very little difference between Scooby-Doo (and most of the other current films of this type) and that classic bomb! Perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered \"sequel worthy\". Also, Just to be fair to Howard the Duck, at least that movie had the visual appeal of Lea Thompson.    If your idea of fun is bombastic, poorly produced special effects, a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you! Certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of the Scooby-Doo character, but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back!    The sequel deserves the exact same review.    -J",

            "input": "A woman's rise above so many adversities . This is a heartbreaking epic tale about the difficult road a young woman must travel when she breaks the rules of social acceptance.  It's hard for a modern young woman like myself to fathom that a mere seventy years ago, this was the fate of an unwed mother. Elizabeth's life is turned upside down when she becomes pregnant, and has no idea where the father has gone.  Social restrictions leave Elizabeth with two unappealing choices: Admittance into a Magdalene convent or marriage to a farmer twice her age whom she has never met.  She chooses the latter and is determined to make the best of it, but the harsh, cold, and desolate landscape of her new home is a metaphor for the fate of her marriage.  Her husband Neely, is very possesive and treats her like a piece of property. He is particularly leary of his Cousin/ Neighbor, Mossie,  who he calls a \"Land Grabber\".  They have been fueding for years over the ownership of family property which also gives way to Neely's fearful possesiveness over Elizabeth.  Elizabeth Dermot Walsh gives a fantastic performance as the fictional Elizabeth, who has been so severely beat down yet stays incredibly strong throughout all the tragic twists and turns of her life.  The most impressive scene is towards the end when Elizabeth kneels at the grave of her stepdaughter and blames herself for her death. That point is the culmination of so many emotions. It shows how Elizabeth has given all she can to rectify herself for all the wrong-doing she feels responsibility toward, but at this point feels she has failed.  The acting is very powerfull in this scene.     I am giving four stars only because I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. It is sad right up until the end, then there is an admition of love and bam -- a wedding and happy ending.  I feel like if you are going to make a movie four hours long there is no reason for an abrupt ending.      This is a fantastic movie for anyone with an interest in women's studies, social influences, period films, or you just want to see a good old fashioned tale of a person rising above so many adversities.  If you like this movie, a good supplement would be \"The Magdalene Sisters\". It will show you what would have been in store for Elizabeth had she admitted herself into the Magdalene Convent. It is not for the faint of heart though, as it is much more brutal and depressing. It will make you angry, but will give valuable insight into the bleak choices that faced Elizabeth in Falling for a Dancer.",

            "input": "Awesome . The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.      In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.    The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up",

It is a rough, rambling, long film, badly dubbed in the English version, but it is also an indispensable, inimitable, and immensely enjoyable journey through a vital part of modern European history. I saw the \"short\" version of the film shortly after its release in 1977--it did not have a long run in the United States--and never forgot it. I saw it again, just now, thirty years later, but this time, the director's much longer cut. It had lost none of its power.",

He looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good. Unfortunately, his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad. I won't explain the story, it is cops vs. drug dealers. There is a beautiful fighting female, good car chases, big name stars, and good fights. How did this movie go wrong? Well, Stanley Tong is a decent director, but he is a stuntman, screen fighter, and martial arts choreographer at heart. He tries to make this an American movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies. I cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film I have seen in a long time. Usually, I am able to get past all of this since I am a sucker for good fight scenes, and this movie does have a few. Highlights to watch for are Ken Lo vs. Marc Dacoscos and Dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight. The thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes, but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie. 'Cradle to the Grave' has a better end fight! Stanley Tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale, Coolio ends up as the main opponent. Not Ken Lo who is the leg fighter that faces Jackie Chan at the end of 'Drunken Master 2', and not Marc Dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors, but Coolio.     I honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie, but the final fight sequence is just horrible. Stanley Tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight. It is just too bad Coolio had to ruin it. 2.5/5     DVD from Dimension Home Video has good sound and picture quality. No special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie.",

This compilation of tracks recorded at historic Montreux in '96 and '00 is just fantastic.

Montreux is in the top two, and I have enjoyed it almost every night since it arrived last month. Paice, Morse, Lord, Glover and Gillan mesh perfectly [as always] and obviously have a great time playing together. They joke around occasionally, and theres a few surprizes that spontaneously erupt on stage [Sooo, thats 'funky Claude' eh? hmmm].    This DP line-up clicks extremely well together, and it shows [I can't believe I am the only one that noticed Gillan giving Blackmore the \"finger\" at the end of 'Paint it Black' on the High Water DVD. If you got it - watch the last second of that track .. BOING! Up goes the 'bird' at Ritchie, who should have gotten a butt kickin instead of just the finger].    If you are a purple fan, or just a music lover who enjoys those nice long live instrumental riffs of great rock & roll that highlight not only the guitarist but all facets of the bands talents, buy this disk.

Small town America... only this isn't the pleasant and white-picketed small town America of film noir fame, it's the gray and colorless small town America of neo-noir, and there's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it.  A bum who's being approached by that famous \"Man in a Black Trenchcoat\"...    Hard Eight (AKA Sydney, but I've yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title) is a debut pretty much as promising as Blood Simple to the brothers Coen.  Paul Thomas Anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best, with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want (or expect) them to do, but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout.    Anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect, allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir.  That said, Anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies, and despite the long takes and steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies, he focuses most of his time on the characters' faces, and just lets them be.    If he hadn't already done the amazing and always stunning later work of Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I'd say that this is a \"promising debut that makes me impatient for the next Anderson picture to come out,\" but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt, I must say, \"See this to see Anderson at his roots,\" and \"Man I can't wait for his next feature!\"    --PolarisDi",

This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like \"pre-birth preparation,\" which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a \"ultimate baby care DVD.\"    The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says \"over an hour of hints\"... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of \"you should always consult your doctor\" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.    I've seen this DVD and the \"ABC of Newborn Baby Care\" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.    BTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It's also available from Netflix.  It's just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price",

Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.    Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:   - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street   - playing the piano too fast   - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much   - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well   - having no recollection of being framed for murder    If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.

            "input": "A True Classic . I remember overhearing a conversation that included my father and other men around his age talking about the movies they loved as young people. All of them agreed that one film was perhaps the greatest film of their youth: CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. I think it's easy to see why this is the case. The story may be old fashioned and this one time classic is hardly read anymore, but the story of young Harvey Cheyne coming of age aboard a Gloucester fishing schooner has a way at tugging at the heart and if given the chance, people can change.    On of the reasons the film works so well is the acting. Depression era child star Freddie Bartholomew plays the incorrigible Harvey. Bartholomew plays the role with great skill. He's miserable enough that we're glad when he finally falls overboard, yet sympathetic enough that we are glad he does get rescued. The transformation is believable and by the films end, we begin to believe in Harvey and even grow to like him. Spencer Tracy won an Oscar as Manuel, the Portuguese fisherman who in some ways becomes the only true father figure Harvey has ever known. Today Tracy would never get away with playing a Portuguese fisherman with his Irish looks and somewhat clumsy attempt at an accent, yet his skill in portraying his character is undisputed. Lionel Barrymore is perfectly cast as the old salt New England sea captain Disko Troop. Mickey Rooney is somewhat underused as the captain's son Dan. My guess is that if the film were made a few years later when Rooney became a matinee idol, he would not be cast in such a small role or the role would be expanded.    While a great cast carries the film, there are also smaller details that make the film powerful. The original sea shanties add a certain flavor. The special effects of the sea are magnificent for their time, and the sailing scenes are stupendous. This was no small feat in the 1930's. The film certainly is a timeless classic. People who purchase this DVD will also love the bonus features; trailers of the 1946 re-release, a short film THE LITTLE MAESTRO and a cartoon LITTLE BICK CHEESER.",

The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the \"natural\" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk \"friend\" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.

            "input": "Superb value package . If Bette Davis is not remembered as the best actress to come out of Hollywood in the Golden Era, she certainly was thought so at the time and this package easily demonstrates the range of her talent. This set, compared to Volume One, which contains obvious Davis hits, covers a wider period of her career from 1937 to 1962. Two favourite Davis films, \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" and \"Marked Woman\" are included.      More detailed reviews of each of these films can be viewed under their individual titles so by way of a quick summary:    - \"Marked Woman\" is a sensational 1937 film about prostitutes who go to court to get their gangster pimp incriminated.  This was the first film Davis made after she walked out of Warner Brothers and was sued for breach of contract.  She lost and returned to the studio but with a new found respect. She gives an intense performance and the film is very exciting with a great downbeat ending.  - \"Jezebel\" is the 1938 film for which Davis won her second Oscar, a precursor to \"Gone with the Wind\" and directed superbly by William Wyler.  The film is a soap opera about a willful Southern girl and would fall into trivia without Davis's subtle performance and Wyler's attention to detail.  - \"Dark Victory\" from 1939 was possibly Davis's favourite role about a Long Island socialite with a brain tumour. The film is a tour de force for Davis who might have won another Oscar if the film had been released in a different year.  - \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" is an ensemble piece, an excellent version of the 1941 Kaufman and Hart Broadway Hit.  Davis supports Monty Woolley, a character based on Alexander Woolcott, who hilariously dominates the film.  - \"Old Acquaintance\" from 1943 maybe the quintessential woman's picture with Davis starring with rival Miriam Hopkins.  It is a picture which resonated with \"woman's issues\" in 1943 and was remade in the 80's as \"Rich and Famous\".  - \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\" is the famous teaming with Joan Crawford in a baroque tragedy which has become a cult (and camp) classic. The film was shot on a small budget and in 3 weeks and it shows.    The extras alone make up hours of additional viewing which enhance the films immeasurably, although some of the commentaries are poor with far too much gossip about Davis's overanalysed relationship with Joan Crawford. Best of all, the excellent documentary \"Stardust: The Bette Davis Story\" has been included.  The Collection is great value",

            "input": "Gantz and Life After Death . Gantz is a tense, emotion wringing story with a lot of blood and a side portion of sex.  Unless you are very tolerant of hardship, blood and sex this isn't for young children.  Parents won't want their children to watch these episodes until they are 18, teenagers will love watching the show when they are 15 and perhaps even a bit younger and will miraculously be totally unharmed except being exposed to a couple of interesting ideas.    Ideas (certainly not comprehensive):  1) What happens after you die could be Heaven or Hell, could be nothing, or it could be something else entirely that no one has considered before  2) Young men tend to be more horny than have sense.  (Amazing how for some reason this just isn't projected most times there are teenagers around)  3) Materialist idea of 'you' or 'I'.  It appears that almost all of the characters in the show are 'captured' at the time of their death and recorded and transported to Gantz.  This either implies that the soul is recordable and recreatable or that the soul is unnecessary in the recreation of a person.  4) The weaponry appears to be fairly original.    Kei Kurono is certainly the most interesting character in the series.  He can be annoying and is certainly obsessed with sex, but I think that merely makes him a relatively accurrate depiction of a teenage male.    One of the key points in this very violent series is that violence is real and although the activities in the Gantz games are certainly violent, you can't get away from violence even in a place that should be safe like home.  This is demonstrated by Kato's little brother being beaten by their Aunt that is taking care of them because their parents are dead.    The effects of violence at home, rather than violence in the Gantz activities are what appear to motivate Kato to incredible rages.  Kato, who is the most reasoning character in the series.  Kato, who is unable to kill in order to survive or even protect his friends - is driven by the violence at home and school to beat people insensible.    The series is neat.  Not all questions are answered in the first series.  Nor, I suspect are they answered completely in the second season.  Some questions perhaps we do not have the answers.  Some answers are held in the Manga and possibly Japanese Anime versions of the show.    I hope they continue to produce Gantz Anime, and perhaps some of those answers will be revealed.  Perhaps it will be like the original Guyver series.  One of the best Anime I've watched and I was horrified that the end, was in fact the end.  Clearly a show (just as Gantz) that there is plently of material to continue the story.    While I'd love to continue reading the story in the Manga, it appears to currently not be available in English.    I will hope that people will be able to watch this show and not be put off by the sex and violence contained within it - just as they are contained in real life.  It certainly provided me with a nice diversion.    Oh, and yes, I hate the fact that there are only 2 episodes per disk.  Who makes that kind of decision?  I have anime with 5 episodes per disk, 2 episodes per disk but most commonly 4 episodes per disk.    Don't waste resources people!  13 episodes could have easily fit on 3 disks compared to 6!  The extra disks, cost to the manufacturer, extra materials for disk holders and the large box - man - it just makes sense to shave some cents off the cost of the series and sell it for the same amount and make more money than waste all those disks with 2 episodes each.    Blech.  Good thing I really like the series.    Atheists, agnostics and secular humanists will probably enjoy this series as well as people who are fairly moderate in temperance.    Folks that take their religion too seriously, don't like anime, don't like sex or feel that there is too much violence on TV - need not apply.    Funny how this is a Japanese animation, with so much blood, guts and sex and they have lower incidences of violence in their country than in the USA.  Must not be the violence and sex on TV that causes the problems, folks!  If blood, guts and sex on TV causes it in reality then Japan must be overrun with roving gangs, rapes and thousands of murders, but we know this is not true",

The long \"set-piece\" scenes (wedding, Russian roulette, etc.) are much discussed, usually either in the context of being \"essential for character development\" or \"boring\". In fact they're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film's awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything \"happen\" narrative-wise.   2 stars is rather generous, but De Niro, Walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting, albeit for such a misguided cause. Ultimately, despite some controversy, many of the film's questionable portrayals of Vietnam, Vietnamese, America, Americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy",

The opera diva is Betty, a young singer who gets a chance to star in Macbeth when the original lead has an accident and breaks her leg. Her powerful (not) performances in Macbeth attracts the killer who randomly kidnaps Betty, ties her up and tapes a row of sharp pins under her eyes forcing her to watch him commit murder. Later on in the film we find out why he does this to her aswell as the killers secret identity. Terror at the Opera is more of a slasher rather than a horror, (as there is no real scary moments in the entire film) but still a good horror.    TATO is a very enjoyable horror/slasher. For the usual horror fanatic, it does deliver as it is gory and strangely at times very humorous. The camera work is great in this film as it exaggerates the gore by simply zooming in on a penetration of a knife or when the camera becomes the eyes of Betty, showing us what she sees through those sharp needles taped under her eyes. Apart from gore, TATO also has a mystery factor. As the film progresses introducing new characters and reminding us of old suspicious characters, the viewer soon begins to wonder who is the killer. And of course this does lead to a twist at the end.    With plenty of violence, mystery, thrills and humor, Dario Argento's well paced feature will not dissapoint. One bad thing I can say about this film is that the acting is quite bad, but that maybe the result of the terrible dubbing. However, Terror at the Opera is still an entertaining film and well worth a look",

Here are some interesting facts relating to \"Heat\" and myself:    LENGTH OF FILM:  547 Minutes  NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN FILM:  231  NUMBER OF INTERESTING OCCURRENCES: 0  NUMBER OF MINUTES I WAS INVOLVED/ENTERTAINED BY THIS FILM: 0  NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE STARTED WATCHING THIS FILM, THEN STOPPED: 5-6     Truth be told, I've never actually watched \"Heat\" in its entirety.  I've seen almost all of it, and many parts of it multiple times, but never all the way through.  (In fact, I think I probably have seen absolutely all of it, considering how many scenes I distinctly recall seeing repeatedly, but I can't be sure.)  Anyway, I'll be sitting there trying to watch it and I just can't do it.  It's so damn boring, and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and I have to do something else.  Like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours.  Maybe just stare at the walls and think.  Mow the lawn, perhaps .  Do some dishes. Clip my toe nails. Anything.  (I hasten to add, however, that its extreme length isn't really \"Heat\"s problem.  It's all boring.  Cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring, just not for as long.  Which would make it about twice as good, actually, but we're talking about such a small baseline that the difference wouldn't be terribly perceptible.)    And it's not like this thing isn't up my alley.  People I trust and who have good taste tell me it's good and  I like crime-dramas.  It has a generally excellent cast. But then I'll be looking at the screen and not one thing, not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it.  And so I stop.  I'd like to be more specific, but it's pretty damn hard to say why a film isn't involving.  It's tough to describe a lack.  Probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it doesn't really have time to get into anything.  I especially like how Pacino's stepdaughter tries to off herself, yet we've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes.  Why would I care? Pacino's marriage is failing, you say?  Why would I care? Pacino and De Niro have tedious conversations with one another.  Oh boy.  It's also hurt by their making Pacino a cop.  He doesn't much work as a good guy.  Furthermore, the action scenes are dull as hell.  Also, one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin.  For other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made, particularly the ones that suck.  (This observation, by the way, comes from the film \"Adaptation\", and though it didn't specifically refer to \"Heat\" it totally applies.  On a related note, \"The 3\" would be about 1000 times more entertaining than \"Heat\", were someone to make it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, be sure to check out \"Adaptation\".  It's a good example of a film that ISN'T really sucky and boring.)       Unlike some things I dislike I feel no animosity towards those who think \"Heat\" is great, though I can't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie, and so they got one at least in their heads.  It's got Pacino and De Niro together!  It's so damned long, complicated, self-important and humorless!  It superficially resembles great films from the past!  4 stars!!  I realize that this is unfair of me and I hate it when other people try and explain the hidden, false meanings why I like whatever movie they don't like, but it's what I think, and if that makes me a hypocrite, which it does, well, I can't change that.  And besides, it's always possible that I'm right....  If in 20 years \"Heat\" is largely forgotten we can assume that I'm correct.  If not I'll watch it again, this time all the way through, and we'll see if I've changed my mind, and we'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if I'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one.  Get back to me in 2026.  Perhaps we'll have to make it 2031, cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy.  I need some more breathing room.    But til then, the hell with \"Heat\".  I'll just watch \"Taxi Driver\" or \"The Godfather\" or \"Goodfellas\" or \"The Departed\" or whatever again.  Just about anything will do, actually, regardless of quality or genre as long as it's shorter than \"Heat\".",

            "input": "The story of the murder and funeral that galvanized the Civil Rights Movement . It was in August of 1955 that 15-year-old Emmett Till was sent from Chicago by his mother to spend the summer with his great uncle, Moses Wright, in Money, Mississippi.  On August 24, Till and some other black teenagers who had been picking cotton went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to get some candy.  In the store Till allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant.  When her husband returned from a trip several days later and heard about the incident, Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam decided to \"teach the boy a lesson.\"  On August 28, they kidnapped Till from his uncle's house, too him to a plantation shed, brutalized the boy, shot him, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie river, having tied a seventy pound fan from a cotton gin around Till's neck with barbed wire.  The two men were tried and found not guilty by an all-white jury.  In January 1956 their confession was paid for and published by \"Look\" magazine.  Both men would die from cancer, Milam in 1980 and Bryant in 1990.      I do not remember when I first heard of Emmett Till, but the story of the black teenager who was killed by white men in Mississippi for the crime of whistling at a white woman was a pivotal event in energizing the Civil Rights Movement and I have known about it for a long time.  However, I never saw a photograph of Emmett Till's body until I was at the Seattle Art Museum looking at an exhibit having to deal with depictions of race and gender in art, and there was a small photograph of Till's body on display at his funeral.  The photograph was too small to tell any details, but you were struck by the swollen and misshaped head.  It did not look human, but then to Milam and Bryant, Emmett Till was never a human being.    The title of Keith A. Beauchamp's documentary is \"The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,\" not because the story has not been told, but because the people he interviewed, including Till's mother, Mamie Carthan Mobley, along with several cousins and friends from that summer in Mississippi, never had a chance to tell their story in court.  Beauchamp provides them with that opportunity, using newsreel footage from 1955 as well.  It follows the chronology of events, from Till's birth to the present and Beauchamp's own investigations into the case (his chief claim is that up to 14 other people were involved in the crime in various ways).  For just telling the story and covering the facts, Beauchamp keeps things pretty basic in his documentary, letting people speak for themselves.      The most unforgettable part of the documentary is when Mobley tells the story of getting her son's body back home.  Officials in Mississippi wanted to bury the body before anybody got a good look at it and when Mobley managed to get it back to Chicago the coffin was nailed shut.  But she got it opened and then describes what it was she saw in simple and graphic details, emphasizing not the horrors but the child she remembered (e.g., she smiles as she talks about how she thought Emmett's teeth were the most beautiful things she had ever seen and then remembering seeing only two of them and wondering where the rest of them were).  It is only after Beauchamp lets her tell of the pivotal point where she decides to leave the casket open at the funeral so the world can see what was done to her son in Mississippi that we go from a school photograph of a smiling Emmett Till to the wrecked ruin of his face and head.  This is the most disturbing image from the Civil Rights movement, but that is exactly why it is the most important one and why its publication in \"Jet\" was an important catalyst.  You really cannot tell the story unless you look at the photograph, and teachers who want to show this documentary to their students should be prepared to defend their decision.      In addition to Mobley, it is Moses Wright, who stood up in court and pointed to the two white men who came and took away Till (there is a photograph of the dramatic moment), who stands out here.  But it strikes me that somebody who is not mentioned by name, William Bradford Huie, played a key role as well.  A journalist and author (\"The Americanization of Emily,\" \"The Klansman\"), Huie was often criticized by mainstream journalists for using his checkbook to get stories.  But it was Huie who paid the murderers to confess in a national publication five months later.  A follow up story revealed that the businesses of Milam and Bryant had gone under because they were ostracized by local whites.  I am sure this did not happen because of the murders, which clearly the jury representing the town supported, but because of the published confession that took away the thin veneer provided by the not guilty verdict.      This documentary received a lot of publicity because it fueled an effort to reopen the case.  The U.S. Department of Justice did reopen the case to determine whether others in addition to Milam and Bryant were involved.  The F.B.I. and Mississippi officials worked on a joint investigation, and while Till's body was exhumed so an official autopsy could be performed, the federal investigation was closed in March of this year.  Consequently, justice in this case will not result in anybody ending up in jail, but rather with preserving the testimony of these witnesses for posterity (Till's mother died after the documentary was completed).  Carolyn Bryant (now Donham after her fourth husband) is still alive and living in Greenville Mississippi.  Signs in her front yard warn that uninvited visitors will be prosecuted, an apparent indication that she believes the law in Mississippi continues to protect her a lot more than it ever did Emmett Till.",

            "input": "Just Sleep-Inducing: Yet Another Pointless Remake . John Carpenter's `The Fog' may not be his greatest film, and that is exactly the reason for remaking or improving it. The character of vengeful Blake could be scarier with modern prosthetics, and the deadly fog that sneaks in on the townspeople could be more atmospheric with today's special effects. Revolution Studios seems to have thought the same way, but sadly something went terribly wrong while making the film itself.    What is wrong? The answer is clear. That is the film's incoherent storytelling, which made me dizzy while watching it. The original's story about the ghosts seeking revenge remains intact, and the film presents how they show up at the quite seaside town (or an island ... whatever) shrouded in a fog. So far, it's good, but the problem is how to tell this story.    Apparently the fog is so whimsical that it appears and disappears without particular logics behind its random actions. It can sneak into a kitchen, but not a fridge. It can turn a human into a mummy-like corpse in a second, but it uses that trick not much, because it seems to know that the CGI is costly. The lack of consistent logics just helps make the film scare-free.     Slow and sleep-inducing pace of the film only makes us realize the impossibility of the film's plot. In horror films I usually don't expect much from the characters, but the behaviors of them here are incredibly stupid. If you find a video camera that might prove your friend is not a killer, you won't hide it from the police and give it to your girlfriend. Forget the law of physics here. If your car crashes, overturning several times before finally plunging into the sea, you would get seriously hurt. Not in this film, because of the driver happens to be the star of the film.     New version of `The Fog' is not scary. Well, the original was not that scary, but it was moody and stylish. They certainly did change some part of the original, but none of the changes make sense. So ... why did they remake it",

            "input": "Pretentious, boring, political, un-real . Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, \"heartfelt\" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. \"War is tough\" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?     One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to \"play opposites,\" meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. \"I'll have her - but not for long.\" THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.    OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.    So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)    The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will \"get it\" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.    An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, \"how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?\" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, \"if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?\"     The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.     I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller.  \"Why can't we all get along?\" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...    A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the \"war spirit\" and how wars are conducted, see \"Gallipoli\" and/or \"Breaker Morant.\" These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.    \"The Thin Red Line\" is what I would call \"professed brilliance.\" A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.",

            "input": "Film Has Some Merit Despite Some Flaws . I enjoyed this film very much.  It strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet.  How many can identify with the lead character David, obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years, a fellow named Theo.  What gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting, devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters.  In an ironic twist, his best friend, Theo, played by John Simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy.  Unfortunately, Simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have NO chemistry, thus making their relationship implausible.  If it is true that gay people look for \"looks in a person first\" rather than personality, then this movie proves that this is a myth.  I liked the fact that David, who could have any man he wanted (because HE is the good looking one) saw beyond Theo's average looks and felt a genuine, albeit, obsessive and unhealthy love for him.  One sympathizes with David because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend, and then hear the details afterward.  Again, how many gay people have ever been in this situation?  It is a common occurrence in the gay community.  Another implausibility is the \"coming out on a talk show\" with a near \"Jenny Jones\" type of fiasco at the end with Theo nearly beating David to a pulp until his girlfriend, who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing David.  One can't believe that Theo would have THAT much violence and hated toward David, no matter what drove David to break up the relationship between Theo and the girlfriend.  John Simm (Theo) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack.  The film ends with David serenely contended in a lush, green park, free at last.  Free from hiding, yes, but free from his love for THeo?  I think not. The film was, indeed, realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society.  However, the end result is that, in my opinion, one is not entirely convinced that Theo would abandon David in such a violent way.  Not after being taken care of and defended by David for fourteen years.  Thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played David, this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable, despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for Theo.  This film is worth a look.",

It is a full-length feature expanded from the bucolic short film, 'Fishbelly White', but which contains none of its lyricism and rural poetry.      Duncan is a 14-year-old misfit known for the chickens that he cares for like pets.  He is isolated and lonely because his mother has just died, and his mono-syllabic father ignores him.  And, in keeping with a time-honored cinematic cliche (starting with `Tea and Sympathy'), he is teased, tortured, and threatened by his macho peers for being 'different'.  It seems that he may have a friend in leader-of-the-pack Perry but this is where the two versions part company.  In the short, they develop a lovely, understated homoerotic romance.  Here, Perry is violent and brutal, like his abusive father, ultimately instigating Duncan's final humiliation.     There is not one moment of tenderness in the entire film until the final 'reconciliation' between Duncan and his father but, considering the unrelenting nastiness which has come before, it feels highly contrived.  Duncan is such a willing, unquestioning `victim' throughout the film, any resolution-of-conflict which might have raised this to a true coming-of-age story is lost.    This is a surprising entry from the usually gay-friendly Showtime Network.  There is nothing friendly about this one.",

It's all very autobiographical about this really \"cool\" and \"talented\" actress Anna Battista who is adored by her public and so wants to get into directing. Daria Nicolodi plays Anna's mother. (Who else?) And Asia is shown as nude as can be involved in a handful of sex scenes that are at times bordering on the harder side of softcore (all of course in the interest of \"honesty\"). And that's about the only good thing that can be said about the movie.    The film just screams \"Me! Me! Me!\" Pity that not everyone who is director, writer and actor in one is automatically an Orson Welles. Prior to the start we even have a clip of Asia advising us that we probably heard already how bad the film is, but that it REALLY is very good (shouldn't that be up to the viewer to decide???) and that it had saved her life blah blah.    This movie has - hands on stomach - some of most pathetic and amateurish performances I have seen in quite some time. It so wants to be arty, hip and experimental and is even shot in three different languages: English, Italian and French. I would have actually preferred if the English parts had also been subtitled as I really haven't got a clue what Ms Argento was mumbling most of the time. In actual fact this ended up being the first DVD where I completely gave up on following the director's commentary: I had to really crank up the sound on it, and still found it hard to hear what she had to say (contentwise: very little anyway). For someone who is supposed to be such an expressive actress, Asia simply has the most boring, dull and expressionless voice I have ever heard recorded.     I was never the biggest Asia Argento fan, but after watching this flick my respect for her dropped to new lows. This lady has one of the biggest Egos in the biz, with unfortunately very little talent or trace of humour to boost and is an utter moron full of pseudo-intellectual pretensions.",

I was 4 years old when this movie was released, but I vividly remember Irene Cara's smash song of the same name in 1980 (especially the chorus of, \"Fame, I'm gonna live forever\") and, after so many years, I was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was I disappointed.    I was thoroughly bored during the first half-hour.  The audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes.    After this painful sequence, the movie finally gets underway.  I tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and couldn't do it.  I appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts (it IS hard work - everybody's an actor, dancer, and/or musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it), and I definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment, but the movie just didn't flow for me.  Perhaps it would have to do with the fact that I'm not one of those people who isn't proclaiming to anyone who'll listen that I'm an \"actress\" (and who rolls their eyes at those people who do).    Besides the slow pace of the story, \"Fame\" is very dated.  The off-the-shoulder top (that became the rage of the early-80s due to Cara's video) and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that \"wonderful\" decade known as the 1980s gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie.

Accomplished director Sidney Lumet directs a insightful and prophetic satire from the expansive mind of Paddy Chayefsky critiquing the business of network television production.    CCA corporation frontman Frank Hackett played by Robert Duvall has taken over UBS network with the idea of finally turning it +  into a profitable situation.  Lagging in ratings behind the big three, Duvall focuses on the news division headed by Max Schumacher played by the aged but excellent William Holden.  Duvall's plan calls for the firing of long time news anchor Howard Beale played superbly in Oscar winning fashion by Peter Finch.    A disconsolate Finch announces on air that in one weeks time, he will blow his head off during his newscast.  His ratings take an immediate bump which comes to the attention of intensely obsessed TV generation programing vice president Diana Christiansen played by Faye Dunaway.  Dunaway encourages Holden to keep Finch on the air, against his better judgement but the ratings hike eventually flattens out.    As Finch's time in gradually coming to an end, he has a bedroom epiphany which inspires him to come on the air after walking the rainy streets in his pajamas.  In a heartfelt spew with wild gesticulations he calls for those watching who are frustrated with their existence, to open their windows and yell that they 're mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore.  His rant strikes home and before long he is a media darling with the number one rated show.  This opens the door for Dunaway to fill her programing schedule with wild and revolutionary shows which threaten to drive UBS to the top of the network heap.    As profits soar, corporate head Arthur Jensen played by supremely talented Ned Beatty is pleased.  However Finch goes too far with his angry prophet routine speaking out against corporate business practices.  He receives an angry rebuke in a brilliant soliloquy by Beatty, who decides that due to a ratings drop that Finch must be silenced.    A combination of Lumet's top notch direction, a cleverly scripted screenplay and a series of superior acting performances make \"Network\" an all time cinematic classic",

I recently bought the recent release of The Ritual Path after seeing some clips on Nijole Sparkis and Fritz Heede's my space pages and really enjoyed the images and music so I thought I would give the Illuminated Manuscripts a try.   I really thought it was well done and would have enjoyed it just for the music. I guess it depends on what you are looking for as to weather or not you will like it. I watched on a regular TV with a $100 DVD player and thought it was great. Someone else may watch on a $10,000 TV and system and may still not be impressed.  I looked at another DVD review that was mentioned and highly recommended by someone that didn't like this one, yet that DVD only had 2 reviews and not good.. So just a matter of taste and perhaps the digital age has made it very hard to impress a person.   I feel the DVD does what it was meant to do, provide some relaxing music with some wonderful scenes, perhaps the title Illuminated Manuscripts explains the writings and emblems that appear in the video.   Perhaps if you are able to watch some clips you will know if it's for you or even check out the more recent Ritual Path. I come from a rock music background and don't feel that I'm easily impressed but from my personal viewing I would recommend both the Illuminated Manuscripts or the Ritual Path. It's been awhile since I have seen some of the other animated clips mentioned in some of the reviews here and admit some of what I remember they were great, but these do what they were meant to do just like Chronos did years ago without the animation....",

            "input": "A LESSON TO REMEMBER... . This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes.     They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise.    The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship.     Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner.    While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting. Yet, at the same time it is puzzling, as it is almost as if there were an atonement involved, but the viewer is left guessing as for what. The film is a compelling one, but in the final analysis falls somewhat short of its mark, with questions unanswered and motives left open to speculation. Still, the film manages to entertain, notwithstanding these shortcomings",

EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling \"horror\" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.      3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the \"so what?\" question.

Upon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger's \"Anatomy of a Murder\" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center.      Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.     Stewart is his dependable self in \"Anatomy of a Murder.\"  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  \"Anatomy of a Murder\" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as \"Anatomy of a Murder\" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.  Yet, this is not the case",

The last time I saw the names \"Adam Goldberg\" and \"Giovanni Ribisi\" together, they were two American Soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain Private Ryan.    Goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long.  At times towards the end I was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to \"Memento\" or something of that nature.  What this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels, that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution.  Some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning.  Despite a stellar cast that besides Rabisi also features Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Vince Vaughn, Haylie Duff and Elvis Costello, it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey.    Rabisi stars as Gray Evans, a movie star actor who is having marital trouble.  Gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set, going through fan email, and getting bugged by people, that a fan is stalking him.  Relentless in his obsession of this belief, he starts obsessing about others around him.  Great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales.  We understand that Gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time, of being the stalker, but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring.  The ideas are there, I just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all.  The sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing, and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat.    If you like Independent films, or want to try something different, by all means give it a try.

In that one she started out slow, repepated it several times, then did it real time, and then added another combination the same way.

When I do it now, I just go right to real time and ignore the slow start, so I haven't been bored at all.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (Jonathan Liebesman, 2006)    In the documentary that serves as one of the DVD extras for Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, a number of the movie's connections talk repeatedly about how their goal for this movie was to push the envelope with the gore. One even says that the people who went to see Hostel and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) will go to see this movie and expect the violence to be kicked up a notch. Well, folks, I just saw the unrated version of your movie, and I've only seen the rated version of Hostel. And I hate to break it to you but, well, even cut by the censors, Hostel blew you out of the water.    For those who have been living in a cave for the past thirty-two years, a quick plot summary: there's a very odd family living out in the middle of nowhere. When the main local business, a slaughterhouse, closed down, it took most of the population with it-- save this family. (The fact that the slaughterhouse is still in operation in the original film, and there are neighbors in some of the original canon films, seems to have completely escaped screenwriter Sheldon Turner [The Longest Yard].) As with any TCM movie, there must be a batch of clueless teenagers, here two guys-- Eric (Tru Calling's Matthew Bohmer), on his way back to Vietnam, and his brother Dean (Zerophilia's Taylor Handley), who's planning on ditching the war and heading for Mexico-- and their girlfriends, Bailey (Diora Baird, recently of Wedding Crashers) and Chrissie (The Fast and the Furious' Jordana Brewster), respectively. There will also be a lot of revving chainsaws.    Now, I readily admit I'm one of the people who didn't recognize the brilliance of Tobe Hooper's original vision for a lot of years after I first saw the original film (close to twenty, in fact)-- thank you, DVD commentary, for pointing out so many things I'd missed my first few times around. I'm still not sure it deserves the classic status it has come up with since, but it's a good, solid piece of work, groundbreaking for its time. There hasn't been a single film, canonical or no, following it that's lived up, but the straight remake Marcus Nispel popped out with a couple of years ago has been the best of a bad lot. Unfortunately, it looks as if the sequels to the remake will have the same relative quality as the sequels to the original-- worse. The acting is wooden, the direction pedestrian, the special effects pretty good but nothing special. But what these guys were after, they tell us, was something really over the top. They were striving not to make a good movie, but to make the mother of all splatter films. And, quite simply, even within the Hollywood machine, they were well upstaged by Hostel before they even started filming. *",

Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.     Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.    The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.    For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.",

Set in the suburbs of Tokyo, \"Whisper of the Heart\" is a story of finding ones place in the real world and of finding one's first true love.  The teenage main character, Shizuku, wants to be a writer and is seeking her place in the world.  While she is a voracious reader, she reads only fantasy which tends to skew her world view.  After meeting a hansome boy, Seiji, who both infuriates and intrigues her, Shizuku sets a personal goal.  Because Seiji knows he wants to study violin making in Italy and is going there for a short apprenticeship to see if he has the skills, Shizuku sets a goal of writing a story by the time he returns in order to know conclusively if she should be a writer.  During the course of Whisper of the Heart, she learns that life and love is not as easy as in a storybook but that with hard work, one may find true love and happiness in real life as well as in stories.  A subplot is Shizuku's relationship with Seiji's Grandfather who serves as the voice of wisdom and experience.  He teaches her that many beautiful things are hidden and may only be exposed with hard work.  He also teaches that life does not always give a happy ending.       Other than the scene showing Shizuku's writing, the story has none of the strange characters, magic, or fantastic settings of other Studio Ghibli U.S. releases.  (In my opinion, some of their best real-life style stories such as \"Omoide Poro Poro\" do not translate well into American culture or the American market.)  The animation is fantastic, which I attribute to the detail Studio Ghibli includes.  This is the film which gave rise to \"The Cat's Return\" and several of the characters are found in both (the Baron, Muuta).    Regardless of the subject matter, I was easily caught up in the story and found it quite compelling.  My wife and I often set the language to Japanese with subtitles (my Japanese is abysmal) and as we found with \"Kiki's Delivery Service,\" the translation of the Japanese dialog is better than what was written for the English version.  Those with some knowledge of Japanese culture will notice some other facets of that culture which underlie the story.  These include studying for the High School admission tests and the \"Goodbyes\" of long-time classmates following junior high school.  I found this to be a good family movie and highly recommend it, particularly to anyone with teenage daughters.",

Oddly enough, on the latter list it's directly below \"Some Like it Hot\" and both films have simalar subjects. Ironically, both subjects are some of the most stereotypical ones. Comedies come out every year involving men dressing as women for some purpose; Only some films pull it off with dignity and real heartfelt humor, though, which is why I think Tootsie is so popular. Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman, in a wonderful performance) is a down on his luck actor. He's been living in New York City trying to make it for twenty years and nothing's happening. One day his agent (played by the films director Sydney Pollack) explains to Michael that no one wants to work with him. Taking matters into his own hands, Michael dresses as a woman and adapts a higher voice and becomes Dorothy Michaels; Michael, under his new guise, auditions for a soap opera and wins the role...And acclaim.  At the same time, he falls in love with Julie (Jessica Lange, who won an Oscar for the role) who is dating the director (Dabney Coleman). Meanwhile, Michael manages to neglect a potential girlfriend (Teri Garr) and freak out his roommate Jeff (Bill Murray, who's hilarious as always). In retrospect, you've seen this film thousands of times...While I wasn't alive the year the film came out, I can't say this is the originator of this storyline, but it is one of the best films to evolve from that storyline. Dustin Hoffman, who is almost always good, is great in the dual role (although his five o'clock shadow can be seen under the makeup in several scenes). Lange is beautiful and wonderful in the role. This is a great movie, if you haven't seen it...Well...See it.    GRADE:",

            "input": "More Fun than a Barrel of Crack Babies . Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.    The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This \"problem\" became an asset later.    The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.    It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.    In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.    Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.    All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.    If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this",

            "input": "\"You'll be the first one I'll tell when I'm in love\" . Everyone, just once in their life has probably had fantasies of pistol whipping or perhaps even punching out at least one member of their family, but the embattled title character Ethan Mao, in maverick director, Quentin Lee's saga of Asian American gay dysfunctional angst gets to do this and so much more.     A whole film about holding your family to ransom by gunpoint may not immediately strike viewers as the stuff of a great story, and may even be a little bit much for most, but Lee manages for the most part to hold this film together, delivering up a tight, taught, if not terribly low budget package that mixes elements of the psychological thriller, coming-of-age drama, gay love story, and even black comedy.    Ethan Mao is certainly overly ambitious in its themes and crude in its execution, but there's a gritty and solemn earnestness to this movie, that lifts it above the usual dramas of teenage angst. What makes this movie worth viewing and so involving, and perhaps also so groundbreaking, is that it depicts a modern, urban gay Asian-American teen, which is something that to my knowledge is very rare in film.     The story takes off when the title character Ethan Mao (Jun Hee Lee) has just been kicked out of his home after Abraham, his father (Raymond Ma) discovered his stash of gay porn. His family is reasonably wealthy having worked hard over the years, now they're the epitome of the immigrant success story. But Ethan's father has made the fatal mistake of putting money before the love of his family. Now his days are spent catering to Ethan's gangly younger brother Noel (David Tran), a bullying and spoilt stepson Josh (Kevin Kleinberg), and Sarah, his slinky, narcissistic, ex-actress wife (Julia Nickson).     Obviously being gay doesn't sit well with Mr. Mao, so Ethan is promptly ejected from the family and immediately - without exploring any other options - adopts the life of a homeless hustler, eventually meeting Remigio (Jerry Hernandez), who also works the streets. The pair develops a fierce friendship based on love, trust, and loyalty. Remigio feeds Ethan, gives him a home and surprisingly keeps his hands to himself. Ethan, for his part has a lack of affect, which presumably signals an emotional numbness.    Ethan enlists Remigio's help to return to his home to pick up his belongings as well as a necklace belonging to his dead mother, but his family, who are supposed to be on a Thanksgiving outing, come home.  A vicious argument ensues, with the two young men holding the group hostage until the necklace can be retrieved from a safe-deposit box the next day.     From here, the film mushrooms into an unlikely hostage melodrama, complete with guns, uneasy family dysfunction, along with lots of emotional recriminations. Josh, the stepbrother hates Ethan, and Ethan hates Sarah, the stepmother, while M. Mao remains appalled at what his son is doing, but at the same time begins to regret the way he's treated Ethan, and the rest of his family.    As the hours progress, Ethan begins to enjoy his newfound power and uses it to tell everyone in the family, especially his uptight and highly traditional dad, exactly what he thinks of them and how he feels he's been mistreated. Meanwhile, Remigio looks on, remaining a silent, and somewhat reluctant witness to the proceedings, and a loyal friend to Ethan.    Ethan Mao is clearly heartfelt and sincere- and an early robbery scene is particularly strong - but ultimately a facile script hampers the film, along with its low production values and its bargain basement, C-grade acting. It is also essential that the viewer feel some sympathy for Ethan, but his decision to freely participate in the hustler lifestyle, when you know a boy as bright as he could do something else, makes it hard for us to really root for him. Ultimately, he comes across as a bit bratty, spoiled, and sad; he should learn to lighten up a little, even if he does have a mean father and a wicked stepmother.    Despite Ethan Mao's obvious shortcomings, the film has an intensity and fervor that is impossible not to like. The film also works as an offbeat tale of love and friendship; Ethan and Remigio, through no fault of their own, have become a couple of devoted urban hustler outlaws. Thank goodness though, that we are subjected to only one of Ethan's elderly and flabby customers. Mike Leonard November 05.",

But I did not at all like the ending; it very much ruined it for me.  I'm a person who needs closure.  Yes, this was a movie demonstrating a tragic topic and should be sad.  But that was just cruel, to end with the poor little girl singing about how she's so lost.  We don't know her fate.      I also felt that Roberto was a sort of villainized character.  He had a point about Gaby having to lose another mother.  I hope that Alicia, when she left, was going to get Gaby.  What I would like to know is what they decided to do with Sara, her possible grandmother.  Again, I need closure!  I was expecting a depressing ending, but not to be left hanging like this!  Arghhhhh.     I also had a problem with Gaby's having been born in captivity.  It makes that scene where the little boys suddenly burst into her room kind of pointless; it's meaningful, powerful, and was one of my favorite scenes untiL I realized she was just startled.  I guess it still has meaning, but, I dunno.  Just my being nitpicky, I guess.      I also want to know who Pedro was.  Also, what Gaby's possible parents did that got them arrested.  I realize that it could have been something very minor, but it would be nice to know.  For all I know they all could have been gun-toting revolutionaries.    Overall though, it was a wonderful movie and I am considering buying it myself.  I especially loved the scenes involving Las Madres y Abuelas de la Playa de Mayo.  And the acting was fantastic.

It's easy to believe in the lone-nut theory of the killing as long as you believe things like:  1) the Parkland Hospital doctors in the ER who had seen many bullet wounds were mistaken about seeing an entry wound on the front of Kennedy's neck, an exit wound on the back of his head, and the absence of the grotesque wound on the right side of Kennedy's head seen on the Zapruder film, 2) the autopsy accurately identified the type and location of Kennedy's wounds, 3) the second bullet fired by lone-nut Oswald passed through Kennedy's body, through Connally's body, and lodged in Connally's leg, later to fall out on the stretcher in good condition and morph from the pointed shape identified by the finder to the rounded shape found by the Warren Commission, 4) the eyewitnesses and police at the scene when the shooting occurred were mistaken about the number of shots they heard, hearing shots originate from the grassy knoll, and seeing the limousine momentarily stop, 5) Oswald fired three shots with a bolt-action rifle in 6 seconds and was able to fire down at a target moving away from him and up an incline while hitting with two shots, 6) Oswald decided not to fire when the Kennedy limousine was coming towards him but waited until after it had made the turn directly in front of him, had traveled several hundred yards, and was moving away, 7) Oswald was able to hide his rifle and race down the stairs from the 6th floor to the 2nd floor lunchroom in 90 seconds without even breathing hard and then be questioned and released by an extremely suspicious police officer who had just raced into the building after hearing the shots, 8) fire a bolt-action rifle 3 times without having any gunsmoke residue on his cheek to be detected by a 'paraffin' test given hours later by the Dallas PD, and 9) a guy just happened to be pumping an opened umbrella up and down on a sunny day at the exact spot of the shooting, when the president came driving by.      If none of these things are a stretch, then you will find ABC's work highly persuasive.  Otherwise, you will start to wonder why ABC is cranking out this kind of stuff and...perhaps...even become a conspiracy nut.  Even if you do lean towards the conspiracy point of view, though, you will find this video well-produced and interesting.",

Joel Hershman's \"Greenfingers\", starring the now-famous (and utterly gorgeous) Clive Owen and Helen Mirren, is a sweet, cutesy, and utterly empty British romantic comedy.  In this forgettable, generic chick-flick, inmates at a British minimum-security prison take up gardening.  Initially, they are understandably reluctant to garden.  But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives!  And, after his parole, Owen's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden!  And Mirren's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her!  Wow, where do people get this stuff?    Of course, this being a \"romantic comedy\" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren's daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other.  In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed \"uplifting moments\".  And none of it works.    For all its good intentions, \"Greenfingers\" is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates' rooms. It's all perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull",

            "input": "the NFL on VHS, transferred...yet again; . \"Football Digest\" once voted week four's 1977 Monday Night game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears one of the top 10 Monday Night games ever played (and arguably one of the greatest Bears games during the post-1963 NFL Championship season).  What was even more significant than it being Joe Namath's last appearance as a starter (or the last time anyone would see Broadway Joe at Soldier Field, and no one had seen Namath in Chicago since the Jets 1974 win over the Bears for that matter) was the fact that Chicago's Bob Avellini threw 3 touchdown bombs in the pouring rain to beat \"Hollywood Joe\" (who was knocked out of the game by Bears LB Waymond Bryant and replaced by Pat Haden for the remainder of the season) and the Rams 24-23.  Not only a great moment in Chicago Bears history, but a great moment broadcasted by  ABC's legendary Howard Cosell.  Just one of the many great moments left off  the \"Chicago Bears - The Complete History\" double DVD release.    What you have here is a compilation of old VHS Bears highlights (most of which were produced in the 1980's by NFL Films) assembled together by the NFL Network and transferred onto DVD.  Making it abundantly clear to real Bear fans that it wasn't compiled by a \"real\" Bear fan.  This 2005 NFL production plays more like a propaganda film than anything else (meaning; this is what \"they\" want you to remember).  A history of the Chicago Bears through their eyes, not Bear fans.  I found it rather insulting to have to listen to some spoiled brats (Virginia McCaskey) banter concerning a game and history of a team she knows nothing about.  What i mean to say is; why couldn't we get some insight from say...Chicago Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander (someone who actually covered the Bears) than someone who sat in a luxury box and picked her nose, totally oblivious to what was happening on the field (the Dave Wannstedt era of the 90's is a clear example of this).    Even more disturbing was the \"Bears/Packers Rivalry\" segment.  Packer fans will find this more engaging than Bear fans, considering the infamous \"asterisk\" game of 1989 (Green Bay's 14-13 instant replay victory)  along with Jim McMahon's 1986 pounding into the Soldier Field astro turf are covered with a fair amount of detail.  Although...i'm still trying to figure out why those moments would be more memorable than Chicago's 61-7 slaughter of the Bart Starr coached Packers of 1980 (which by the way wasn't mentioned at all here).  Instead we're shown (Ditka's continuing \"fullback\" saga) William Perry's 1985 Monday Night touchdown as though that were the only memorable moment of the Bear/Packer rivalry concerning Bear fans.  I mean...who's highlight reel is this? For a more comprehensive view of this rivalry, pick up Gary D'Amato's \"Mudbaths and Bloodbaths\" book. Although a bit pro-Packer in places, a good read never-the-less.  And after all, at this point in the DVD...anythings better than watching Green Bay's Don Majkowski spike the ball after scoring a TD (against the Bears mind you), on a Bears highlight film no less.    The NFL Network and NFL Films continues with its barrage of lowlights and insults levied against Bear fans by showing clips of the New York Giants 47-7 mauling of the Bears (in color mind you) in the 1956 NFL Championship, but failing to show any highlights from the famous snow bowl of 1977.  This was an important game to the Bears and their fans. It marked Chicago's return to the post-season for the first time since 1963. I can still hear Vin Scully's \"watch Fencik lower the boom\" on New York's Jimmy Robinson in one of the most devastating hits in the history of the game itself.  Chicago won the game 12-9 (a classic nail biter) in the last frantic seconds of OT to capture their sixth game in a row and finish the season at 9-5 enroute to the playoffs.  But we're shown none of this.  Instead we're told how great Frank Gifford was before, during, and after a few clips of the 1963 NFL Championship victory over the Giants.  Again...who's highlight reel is this? Also, there was no mention at all of the Bears week nine game of 1977 (the game that started the 6 game win streak) against the Marv Levy coached Kansas City Chiefs (Bob Avellini's TD pass to Greg Latta as time expired to steal a 28-27 victory in the wake of another brilliant performance by Walter Payton) or the 1979 demolishing of the St.Louis Cardinals 42-6, to finish the season at 10-6 and secure a playoff birth (the day after \"Mugs\" Halas' death, and yet again...NFL Films failed to mention any of it).    And although it was humorous to see Abe Gibron's \"wired for sound segment\",  lets not forget...he never coached a winning team in Chicago.  Watching Gibron just reminded me of all those losing seasons after the 63' NFL Championship. And considering the absolute chaotic, mind-numbing bewilderment on the sidelines, it's a miracle the Bears won any games at all under Gibron's baffling direction. The only memorable Gibron moment would have to be 1972's Monday Night win over the Vikings at Soldier Field (the game in which Abe got carried off the field,...a huge achievement considering the fact that the Bears hardly ever beat the Vikings during the late 60's & early to mid 70's, and well...taking into consideration that it was a nationally televised game and  Gibron's weight (lbs)...it was probably the most work the players did all year). But even more poignant than that for Bear fans was the priceless blank look on Gibron's face, captured by the CBS camera crew during the last home game of the 1974 season. In the midst of a 5 game losing streak, a mere 18,000 fans showed up in the rain and sleet to watch the Bears Mirro Roder split the uprights in the closing seconds to clip the Giants 16-13 (known as the \"fight inflation or conserve energy; stay home and watch Bears lose\" game...only they won!).  But again...we're shown none of this.      Casual Bear fans will find this insightful and entertaining i'm sure. But real Bear fans will find this to be nothing more than an overpriced cheap VHS transfer of the same recycled  file footage NFL Films delivers whenever a Chicago Bears documentary is in order.      ...hardly a complete history.      olofpalme6",

            "input": "Walk softly, carry a big stick, and have Johnny Knoxville as backup . Ex-Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business. He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business. In fact, things have changed for the worse in Kitsap County and home isn't home anymore. There's now a nasty element in the former little town and Chris's old friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) seems to be in the thick of things, with his thriving casino and burgeoning drug empire. It doesn't take long for Chris to nose out the corruption and soon, Chris and Jay are at vicious odds with each other. After Chris is beaten and tortured and his young nephew falls prey to crystal meth, Chris runs for and becomes the local sheriff. He then tries to set things right with his town, waging his own personal battle against crime, armed only with a length of cedar and the loony but dependable help of his buddy Ray (Johnny Knoxville).       This film is a distant cousin of the first Walking Tall movie back in 1973, which told the more or less true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser. The premise is the same, that of a man who has had enough of vice and crookedness infesting his town and decides to do something about it - to wit, getting elected Sheriff. But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock-like sensibilities. Walking Tall (2004) is more action-oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic. It doesn't take itself as serious as the original;  it is, in fact, laden with a healthy dose of rowdy humor, much of it being contributed by wildman Johnny Knoxville. At a running time of one hour and 27 minutes, director Kevin Bray doesn't try to embroil the viewer into too much set-up, but instead gets right to the nitty-gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave - the Rock's physicality and charisma.      Yes, the Rock is an action star. He'll never do Shakespeare or go on stage. But, in his specific genre, he shines. And he does have enough thespian in him to capably and convincingly play his formulaic silent but kick-ass roles. What sets him apart from other would-be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self-deprecating, wink-of-an-eye (arch of an eyebrow?) quality that enables viewers to like him and identify with him. The rest of the cast, with two exceptions, are mediocre and bland, but, at least, they don't hurt the film. The intense Neal McDonough stands out as he invests his villain with frozen, blue-eyed menace and cold-blooded venom. A very good and formidable villain indeed. Johnny Knoxville is just plain fun to watch as he plays his Ray Templeton with unpredictable wackiness. The laugh he uses (I don't know if that's his real laugh) when he and Chris are watching television is just plain out infectious.     Basically, this little actioner, the Rock's follow up to the superior The Rundown, doesn't have anything new to say. It is what it is: a short, enjoyable movie that's sure to give the audience a good time. It certainly beats Son of theMask, or a fork in the eye.  It gets 3 and a half stars from me.",

It touches on several themes, including the plight of the refugees, and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry. Much of the story takes place at a construction site, where the central character, a young Iranian, a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen, gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father, injured at the work site.    The young man's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl, and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family. Though they never exchange a word in the film, she leaves a deep impression on him, and he is utterly changed by his experience. A story that is about the transformation of character, the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process, often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines, wordlessly ponders his situation, or goes in search of the girl and her family. Director Magid Magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men, the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them, and the unforgiving weather (snow, rain, cold) in which they all labor.

            "input": "Wet Willis' for everyone! . Welcome to a new style of reviews.  For those of you who have been following my career, my comments on the films that I have seen have been lengthy, verbose, and at times, just plain boring.  Today marks a day of change.  I am finding myself with less time, energy, and dedication to the cause, so I am changing.  Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans - but for me, it is still all about the cinema.      War, really people, what is it good for?    Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film \"Hart's War\", absolutely nothing - do you need me to say it again?  To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany.  No brutality, no murder, no starvation - just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other.  Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his \"luxury\" suite.  He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.     Did I hint towards \"The Great Escape\" - please don't think the same thoughts with this film.  What makes \"Hart's War\" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers.  It comes in the form of Terrance Howard.  One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way - but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films.  It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest.  Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, \"You can't handle the truth\", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.    How bland.      \"Hart's War\" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time.  Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape.  It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film.  Willis is Willis.  If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film.  Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp.  I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp.  Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans?  Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?      Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, \"oh brother!\".  The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen.  It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.      This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions.  It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls.  For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film.  While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum.  This is strange, because I loved \"Fallen\" so very much.  \"Hart's War\" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.          So, again my friends, I must ask - what is war good for?    To my reply ... absolutely nothing.      I cannot suggest this film to friends or family.  Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give \"Hart's War\" a    (wait for it ...)    BLAH",

Those who have read the novel will find this difficult, but others are in for a treat.    Although somewhat shocking at first, this finely crafted film contains many nuances of political and social commentary that become more apparent on subsequent viewing.  This film has aged well, given the current political climate and world events.  Here we see a vision of government founded on the politics of fear and openly contrived war set in a framework of WWII and Cold War-styled propaganda.  Unfortunately, the parody is not as exaggerated as one might hope.    Visually, the film is spectacular.  The score by Basil Pouledouris is itself worth the price of admission and is one of the best I have heard in three decades of collecting soundtracks.    Despite this recommendation, I should emphasize that this film is absolutely violent, with the stated aim of depicting the realities of war and is definitely not for the faint-hearted.    An interesting aside, probably not well known outside Australia, is that Australian politician Pauline Hansen (One Nation) ran a youth campaign directly modeled on the graphics and narration style of the Federation propaganda web clips depicted in this film; an hilarious blunder considering the controversy surrounding her campaign (accusations of fascist leanings by her critics)",

Subspecies is an excellent, 4-part series written and directed by Full Moon Studio's Ted Nicholau (Actually, the first three Subspecies are allright, but the fourth movie sucks in my opinion). However, Vampire Journals is nothing more than a feeble attempt to portray a different side of the Subspecies archetype.     The characters, scenes, and acting in Subspecies Part 1-3 were superb. Yet this movie has an insipid plot and the actors are novice at best. The vampire teeth/fangs look horrid on most of the actors, and I was bored for the last 1/3 of the film.     Essentially, the plot...if you can even call it that pertains to a vampire named Zachary, who wants revenge for unwillingly being turned into what he is. So Zachary (Whoever thought to name a supposedly wise and powerful vampire Zachary anyway?) sets out to destroy an ancient and extremely lame vampire cult headed by Ashe, a fledgling of the main antagonist (Radu)of all the Subspecies films.    In addition to this, Zachary tries to rescue a female pianist named Sophia, who has been kidnapped by Ashe. Because she is a gifted musician...or something, Sophia is being forced by Ashe, a  fervid music lover, into becoming a vampire as well. Really there's not much else to go into, except that you should definitely not waste your time or your money on this film. So unless you're a die-hard Subspecies fan, or you basically just want to get drunk and have something to make fun of with your friends, try watching Subspecies 1-3 because they're the best you're gonna get from director Ted Nicholau",

The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.      The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.    At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.      I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.      On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.

I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny. Most critics batter him for childish antics, bathroom humor, violent slapstick, and immaturity. True, he can childish and immature in his humor, but he is just lovable enough to get away with it. Anyway, the people I know like to laugh at the one-liners and antics of BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WATERBOY. but not a lot people talk about BIG DADDY as much, and that's too bad.     Meet Sonny (Sandler), a 32-year-old law school grad on the fast track to nowhere: Rather than take a high-paying job in a high-powered New York City firm, Sonny works one night a week in a tollbooth and hangs out with the deli delivery guy (Rob Schneider). Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five-year-old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law-school buddy Kevin (Jon Stewart), who's just left for China. No problem, thinks Sonny: A son will get his life on track and help him win back his wayward girlfriend (Kristy Swanson). But when a compromising situation arises and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him, Sonny gets desperate and has social services look for a family that can take Julian. Instead of letting Julian end up in an orphanage he volenteers to look after him, giving the kid options instead of orders, letting him dress however he likes, bathe when he wants and eat what he likes, but soon he realizes that he needs to set boundries for the kid in order for him to excell school. Sonny starts to bond with the kid. But after ignoring calls from social services, Sonny is taken to court for Fraudulently hold Julian under his biological father's name.    I think this is one of Sandler's best, not only because he's downplaying his humor impulse to stutter like Bobby Boucher, get violent like Happy Gilmore, or act childish like Billy Madison. But because he seems to have matured a bit as an actor and as a person. His humor is dry, but funny. Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy. Adam has really come a far way since BILLY MADISON, he's a hell of a lot more calmer, and a little bit more likable to the non-Sandler-fan community. Yes there is some bodily humor here, but it's marginal and it doesn't come from Adam, which is good because it wouldn't wear well on a man in his mid-30s as it would on a little kid. All in all, if you're not a Sandler-fan, you're better off not watching his earlier stuff first, because he can get carried away with the childish humor, so start off slow and watch BIG DADDY, THE WEDDING SINGER, or 50 FIRST DATES.",

This is an excellent training DVD if you want to maximize your fitness conditioning and increase your functional strength, suppleness, agility and coordination. The 3 training segments are each 20 minutes, not 10 minutes as another reviewer reported. The videography is excellent, clearly and simply showing each movement without any fancy fadeouts or quick switches. Each phase is more challenging. I would say that the phase 1 section can be done by most people of average fitness after a couple of weeks of practice. However at first you may need your remote to pause the DVD until you acquire the skill to transition into and out of some of the more challening postions. Let's face it, if you aren't at an average fitness level then you should be doing a different overal kind of training, not focusing on abs. Personally I am 56 years old and teach Holistic Nature Workouts professionally. I have shared the training methods in this DVD with several people already and they have all benefited tremendously from them and are now including them in their workouts. Have a ball",

To say he is entertaining would be an understatement. I have yet to see anything like the Jamie Oliver Tour. He includes just about every element of entertainment possible in one show. It is a game show, cooking class, cooking competition, music gig, sports event, comedy show, talk show (he almost interviews some of the audience members), magic show and sing along. Basically this is Jamie Oliver's mind on cooking and he is in constant motion, meeting every challenge and even batting oranges into the audience to select people to join him on stage.     The recipes are simple to make and after watching this show you might find yourself trying out something new, and not even measuring anything. I tried his idea with the foil bag to cook fish and it was one of the best dinners I've ever made. The ideas transcend recipes and enter the arena of creative exploration. You can cook with what you have in the kitchen. Don't have leeks? Try onions and potatoes. Want to learn to make your own pasta? Is it really as simple as eggs and flour? Watching Jamie Oliver maker pasta is like watching an artist create. Where he excels is in how he transfers his knowledge to the audience members and they to learn to make pasta, right on stage and he turns it into a competition.     While fast paced and wildly funny, there are a few casual moments to relax. Jamie challenges himself to make Pizza before the Pizza guy arrives. He orders pizza and then tosses flour on the counter and begins to make pizza dough from scratch. His ideas about sun dried tomatoes and fresh mozzarella will make you wish you'd been to the store for the ingredients. In fact, you might want to stock up on ingredients and cook along with Jamie. He really helps to make life less ordinary and more extraordinary.     The new apartment is the entire stage and the set is filled with surprises to entertain. You will start to wish you had a kitchen computer. Jamie leaves the set now and then and there is a screen showing a night out on the town, what it is like to cook in a restaurant kitchen and his wife checks in with him to find out what he is making for dinner. He even makes a cheesecake and then delivers it for a birthday party.     By watching Jamie cook, you can learn basic techniques, time saving tricks and creative uses for herbs and spices. Everything he has taught me to make through his shows and this DVD has turned out to be absolutely delicious and I love the fact that a lot of the things I learn don't require me to measure ingredients.     ~TheRebeccaReview.com",

It's a countdown to extinction.  Theo(Clive Owen) is asked to deliver a young pregnant girl out of the tumultuous country.

I totally got caught up in the effort, completely absorbed by the significance of this mission.  The action really kept me on edge.  I was expecting the movie to get too preachy with apocalyptic themes, you know--hell, fire and brimstone.  Any religous fanatics would definitely have some valid points.  This is touched on periodically, but doesn't go too over the top.  I also liked the sarcasm evident when some idiot spray painted a sign that read \"Last one to die, please turn out the lights\".

I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.     Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.     This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.     That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.     Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.     Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.     They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered \"scary\" is with the cheap haunted-house \"BOO!\" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.     Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.

Add to that the fact that the artistic integrity of the film was likely to be ruined by the studios decision to populate the feature with a multitude of cameo appearances by just about every living movie star in Hollywood. Sure signs of impending doom surrounded this project.    Surely director George Stevens pulled off a major miracle. Aided by one of the finest soundtracks in motion picture history provided by the legendary Alfred Newman, some of the most gorgeous cinematography and set designs you'll ever see and an unforgetable performance by Max von Sydow 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' lived up to it's title to become the definitive film version on the life of Jesus of Nazareth.

Catherine Keener is one of my favorite actresses but she doesn't use her trademark sardonic wit and sarcastic humor like in a lot of her other movies (i.e. Being John Malkovich, Your Friends and Neighbors) but she still manages to come away from this subversive comedy with a well likable character.

            "input": "Hollywood Apocalypse... Sorta . It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.    As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that \"Day of the Locust\" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.    \"Locust\" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.    But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.    It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in \"An Englishman Abroad\". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.    It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...    Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, \"Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!\" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot.     To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a \"symbolic\" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours.     Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after \"Locust\" appeared. Then they went and made this movie. Remember that next time you start thinking that life is unfair.",

However, I found the disk quite entertaining and helpful.  Gigi and Pedro do not come across as so elegant and skilled that it seems impossible for the average person to copy.  Yes, both know what they are doing and are quite fluent in what they communicate.      The instruction on the disk allows you to watch their whole demonstration from beginning to end or go through each set of steps and turns lesson by lesson.  You also have THREE choices of camera angle.  The default is from in front.  You can also choose looking down from above, or from the back.  This multi-view method allows you to see things in the dance that a simple 2D presentation from the front actually hides.    The names of the steps are given in Spanish, but even if you don't speak the language you will pick up on the names quickly; it is not hard.    I did miss the discussion of how to communicate dance steps through hand motions that I have seen in another salsa series.  One isn't going to call out the names of the steps as Gigi and Pedro do throughout these disks.  It is the subtle way one moves the hands and touches the partner that communicate what is to be done next and that is as much a part of learning the dance as the footwork.    Still, a pretty darn good set of instructional disks",

Upon reflection, that's not terribly surprising, given how strong a film it is; good things, it often seems, never flourish in the sandy, sandy soil of Hollywood. And Niccol (Gattaca) has created a good thing here.    Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law. Or they are until Vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab, leaving Yuri to fly solo-- just as the Berlin Wall comes down and the arms market takes off. Yuri is being dogged by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an FBI agent who's sure he's breaking the law.    As an action movie, it's kind of fun, interesting, a bit slow at times but watchable all the same. As a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who's just trying to make his way in the world, it's incisive, well-done, witty, charming. However, the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties. Yuri Orlov is the perfect character to allow Niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time. Yuri traipses through the former Soviet Union and Africa, and Niccol follows with his camera, casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled (at best) analogues of real dictators. It's good stuff; you probably didn't see it in the theater (very few did), but you can catch what you missed then on DVD now. ***",

None--and I mean not one--of the interior scenes is adequately lighted; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background.

Then there's the DVD which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film.

It presents some very cool testimonies of Rod Taylor, Ray Bradbury, Tony Curtis, Joe Dante, Barbara Eden, Ray Harryhausen, Roy Disney, Charlton Heston, Walter Lantz, Janeth Leigh, Tonny Randall, Gene Roddenberry and Robert Wise. Originally an architect, the Hungarian George Pal (1908-1980) is one of the best references of the fantastic cinema and the animation in stop-motion. Pal became famous in Europe for his advertising films using animation of dolls, technique named by him as \"Puppetoons\". The first one of them, in 1932, was a great success and showed cigarettes dancing. Running away from the Second World War, the director went to United States where he began to work to Paramount Pictures. He started making a series of short animations and soon he was producing and directing movies, always with his particular touch of fantasy and special effects. During five decades Pal produced and/or directed classics as \"War of the Worlds\", \"Seven Faces of Doctor Lao\", \"Destination Moon\", \"The Time Machine\", \"Conquest of Space\", \"When Worlds Collide\", \"Atlantis: The Lost Continent\",\"Sinbad \",\"Aladdin\" and \"The Wonderful Worlds of Brothers Grimm\". \"The Power\"(1968) and \"Doc Savage\"(1975) were his last productions.

            "input": "\"I'm in print!\" . Navin Johnson is an idiot.  He was adopted and raised by black sharecroppers in Mississippi.   Navin loves his family but he feels he doesn't fit in.  His family all has rhythm, but he doesn't.  So, on his 18th birthday he leaves to discover the rest of the world. After hitching a few rides he ends up in St. Louis working and living at a gas station.  My favorite scene in the entire movie happens there.  The new phone books arrive and Navin gets all excited.  \"This is the kind of spontaneous publicity--your name in print--that makes people.  I'm in print!  Things are going to start happening to me now.\"  That scene is priceless.  While at the gas station Navin invents a device for a man's glasses that later makes Navin a billionaire.  But, before that happens he gets shot at by a crazy sharpshooter, gets a job at a traveling carnival, meets a biker chick, breaks up with the biker chick, and fall in love and marry the woman of his dreams, Marie Kimble (Bernadette Peters).  Of course, Navin ends up loosing everything and that's why he's a jerk.    THE JERK wasn't Steve Martin's first movie, but it was his first starring role in a feature film and introduced the style of comedy he was doing on the comedy circuit to a broader audience.  The movie is filled with all kinds of jokes from witty one-liners, poop jokes, sexual innuendo, slapstick, and a lot of crazy nonsense.    There were moments of THE JERK that I really enjoyed, but there was a lot of stuff that was just plain stupid.  Of course, there's a lot of material in the film that no one would be able to get away with today.  Steve Martin always was more than just a \"Wild and Crazy Guy.\"  He's an intellectual at heart and one can see snippets of that side of Martin in THE JERK. Unfortunately, it's overshadowed by the type of comedy Martin was doing on the comedy circuit that appealed mainly to teenagers and college students.  Actually, the reason I ended up liking THE JERK wasn't because of Martin at all, it was because of Bernadette Peters.  Peters is one of the finest actresses of all time--she can do serious drama or slapstick comedy and do it better than any other actress.  She's a classy lady with a broad charm.  Martin is the star of THE JERK, but the film would not have been able to stand if it wasn't for Peters.    THE JERK is a must-see movie for Martin or Peters fans.  It's also a movie that people who enjoy lowbrow humor will probably like.  The film's largest audience at the time it was released was college students and teenagers.  Twenty-five years that core audience probably hasn't changed much",

There are some classic shot sequences that have been honored in more recent films, and you should look for these. For example, Spielberg must be a big fan. Pay attention to the shot compositions for the field (fence, lighting, etc.) and seek out homages to be found in Close Encounters and War of the Worlds.    It is also highly informative to note the perspectives used for social mores, and for science in general. In today's world, the notion that \"the town scientist\" would turn his astonomical telescope into the daylight sky and view heavenly objects, then turn it below the horizontal and look across the countryside to view the goings on at a top secret military base, are both hoots. That the scientist sees a classic rocketship and knows simply by the form that it is \"atomic\", is classic. One can only imagine the wonder that science and the future held for the popular mind back then that the writers could get away with that kind of stuff.    And yet, in contrast, note the strong presentation of the female role, not as a nurse, but as a doctor who makes the initial tough decisions and takes charge of the situation, driving the story forward. Very progressive, when contrasted with the \"scientist love interest who exists to admire the brilliance, bravery and manhood of the hero\" found in the typical films of this genre and era. Admittedly, our heroine is subjected to those stereotypes later on in the story, which is disappointing.    I also love the military response. This is shortly after WWII. Because some kid has a bug up his tail, we roll the tanks onto the trains and storm the town. Commanding officers up on rooftops with binoculars!!    In summary, our modern levels of sophistication might diminish this film to Mystery Science Theater, but that would be unfair. Instead, I recommend watching it once for the sheer joy of it. Then, watch it a second time with a more critical eye and have all your laughs and pick out all your iconic scenes for future reference",

When I use the term \"horror\" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which \"the changeling\" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time.    The changeling doesn't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story. A strong script, excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers (Hitchcock) or modern horror films in the mold of \"the sixth sense\". If you're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you'll need to look elsewhere (thankfully). This film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills. For those who don't prefer to watch R-rated films I can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge, has very little violence, no nudity, and certainly nothing that can be considered \"graphic\" by todays standards. Most modern films rated PG-13 have more disturbing content than this film. If you're an adult viewer looking for suspense and thrills but you want to avoid gore and graphic violence.... the changeling is a good choice!    Not a perfect film, but an excellent effort that holds up well.    -J",

            "input": "I Liked It...Just Not as Much as Everyone Else Does. . \"The Searchers\" is considered by many to be a masterpiece of both the Western genre and of movies in general. It's even on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#96). I liked the film; It's got a lot of good things about it, but one thing I look for in a film to really call it \"Great\" is entertainment. The movie is entertaining, but a movie on that same list that's a few notches below it ('Unforgiven') was a much better movie; Both as a film and as entertainment. Anyway, I've seen over a thousand movies and have somehow never seen a John Wayne film. Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier who shacks up with his brother and his family. After they're all killed and his two nieces are kidnapped, Ethan sets out on an obsessive quest to get them back. One of the nieces is found dead soon after and the rest of the film is about them trying to find the living one Debbie (Natalie Wood). Along with him is Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter), a man Ethan doesn't really like. Ethan hates indians and Martin is 1/8 Comanche. Early in the film, you find out that Ethan actualyl saved Martin when his family was killed by indians and gave him to his brother and his brother's wife. Even though he seems disagreeable, it sounds like Ethan's quest in honorable enough. But, you'd be wrong. He's not out to save Debbie, but to kill her. When people are kidnapped by the indians, they pretty much become one...And Ethan can't have that. The movie takes place over a long time span and there were times that, I thought, the movie seemed longer than it was. The film has beautiful cinematography though, especially when you consider that the film was released in 1956. John Wayne's performance is very good and, you find later, multilayered. Having read about the film a little bit, I found that it inspired movies like Taxi Driver and even the Buddy Holly song  \"That'll Be the Day\" (which is a line Ethan frequently says). I should make this clear that I'm not a huge fan of classic westerns, so that may have something to do with my view of the film. I know that certainly not everyone will agree with me about it. But I can say this. If you're a big fan of Westerns and/or John Wayne. You'll probably like this movie.     GRADE:",

            "input": "Classic . Its setting and subject matter were somewhat grim to put it mildly, but that didn't stop Trainspotting from becoming one of the top movies of the nineties, and having just watched it this morning I can safely state that it holds up well to this day.  While I haven't read the Irvine Welsh novel on which this movie is based, I have read some of his other work, and the movie is a perfect distillation of his storytelling style-rapid-fire, filled with bawdy set pieces, characters living on the edge of acceptable society, and lots and lots of swears.  It's also the kind of violent, genre-defying, and pop culture reference-laden movie, complete with way-cool soundtrack, that emerged with such force in the nineties and spawned so many imitations in this decade.  For my money at least, this movie is a much more entertaining and convincing look at the world of heroin users than the interesting, but annoyingly depressing and pedantic, Requiem for a Dream, which came out a few years later to almost hyperbolic praise.  Trainspotting is a blunt, unapologetic look a life most of us can scarcely imagine, delivered with a combination of hilarity and horror that effortlessly intertwines these two extremes.  It doesn't shrink from depicting the damage caused by heroin addiction, but it doesn't downplay all the fun of it either, which is what lends it so much of its gritty believability.     Trainspotting also marked the arrival on the international scene of director Danny Boyle, whose manic visual style would later serve him well on the slightly-less-brilliant 28 Days Later.  Perhaps most impressively, it manages to contain one of my all-time top ten movie lines (\"Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?\"), my favorite nickname ever, fictional or otherwise (\"We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit\"-brilliant), and more \"Oh my God, did I just see that?\" images than you'll find in fifty Hollywood blockbusters.  In Boyle's hands the crazy imagery practically flies off the screen, be it human waste flying from a sheet across a room, the movie's protagonist climbing into Scotland's filthiest toilet to retrieve something he lost, or the hallucinatory, nightmarish haze of a cold-turkey withdrawal.  The unrestrained depictions of sex, nudity, violence, drug use, and bodily functions make this a movie not to be viewed by the squeamish, but they perfectly suit its unflinching examination of the sordid goings-on in one country's drug-laden urban culture.      The action is filtered through the point of view of the movie's narrator, Mark Renton, a cynical but insightful twentysomething travelling through a nihilistic culture of nightclubs and drug dens without many concerns beyond getting his next fix because, well, all other concerns seem petty and inconsequential by comparison.  Although I don't use drugs (well, the ones arbitrarily declared illegal anyway), it's not exactly hard to understand Renton's reasons-in a world as numbing as the one that surrounds him, the ephemeral rush of a heroin high is more tangible and true than most of what people use to distract themselves from their unfulfilling lives.  Really, that's what the movie's about-the relentless pursuit of that elusive and nebulous concept known as happiness.  Renton's not that bad a guy; he mostly just wants to score some drugs and sex and listen to some Iggy Pop, and if his lifestyle causes anyone else (i.e., his parents) to suffer, well, that's just an unfortunate byproduct.  Besides, it's not like he's missing that much: the Scotland of Trainspotting is a rather depressing land of dingy, Detroit-esque post-industrial decay, and even the natural beauty of the local highlands isn't enough to overcome the cynicism that's overtaken Renton and most of his friends.  Viewed against this backdrop, it's easy to ask whether the straight life is even worth it.    Although Ewan MacGregor plays Renton in career-making fashion (too bad he spent all that time on those mediocre Star Wars prequels), Robert Carlyle delivers the most immediately enjoyable performance as the menacing Begbie, an unhinged, beer-swilling psychopath who looks at heroin users with contempt but has no problem cutting a swath of destruction through any bar where someone crosses him, intentionally or not.  Even though (or perhaps because) he's so violent and unpredictable, Begbie gives the movie a sort of bizarre comic relief through the sheer force of his twisted personality alone.  Even though I wouldn't get within fifty feet of the guy, I couldn't help but enjoy watching him, especially with Carlyle turning in such a likably maniacal performance.      Besides, in addition to what I've written above, how can you not like a movie that features a shot of a dead baby crawling along a ceiling and rotating its head 180 degrees?  If that doesn't scream fun for the whole family, I don't know what does",

Both are funny and being offered together makes them a bit more affordable. Reviews of both appear below.        SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF    James Garner always does a great job in playing acerbic comic roles and his role in this one is no exception. He plays a man who is hired as sheriff in a gold rush boom town and who takes the job seriously enough to clean the place up. He does so with wit and charm and the bad guys never no what hit them.     Bruce Dern plays the first guy he arrests. He is a bad one but not to bright. This is a good thing since the bars for the jail have not been installed yet. Walter Brennan plays Dern's father. He is the head of the outlaw family but just can't seem to get his way with the sheriff. His performance too is a delight. Jack Elam plays the deputy and Harry Morgan plays the mayor. All do a wonderful job.     There is always something to laugh at in this one.        SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER    SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF was a comic masterpiece and cried out, at least in terms on dollars and cents, for a sequel. So they made one, only it wasn't    Almost all of the cast from the SHERIFF appear in GUNFIGHTER but they all play completely different characters. Nothing is the same except that it takes place in the west and is funny, but not as funny as the original.    James Garner plays the role of Latigo Smith. He is a man on the run, not from the law but from a woman who expects to marry him. He goes to ground in Purgatory, a mining town. His arrival is noted by the owner of one of the town's two competing mining companies. They think he is a gunfighter hired by the other company. He's not but sees financial opportunity in the confusion. He passes himself off as the agent for the gunfighter (less danger and stress) and cons a down on his luck cowboy into playing the part of the gunfighter.     This is not a movie filled with excitement or drama. It is a comedy. It is not as funny as SHERIFF but it is funny in its own right.",

Face Off is in my opinion an all time classic film, the plot at first glance is fairly ridiculous and unrealistic but it is one of those cases where if you suspend your disbelief you will love this film.  John Travolta plays Sean Archer a police detective whose son was accidently killed by Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) while attempting to kill Archer, who had been tracking him for several years.  Archer then makes it his lifes ambition to catch Troy, and early in the film Archer finally catches and apparently kills his man (Troy is in a deep coma afterwards), only after he reveals vague details of a chemical attack on L.A.  After interviewing his brother Pollux Troy, they find out there is indeed an attack iminent in L.A, but he will give no details of the location.  It is then that the undercover Face swap idea is suggested, from this point on Archer is played superbly by Nicholas Cage, who goes into prison to recover info from Pollux.    The plot dramatically changes when Troy awakes fom his Coma, after finding a video of the operation and finding his face missing, he calls in a few associates to help him.  The doctor who performed the operation on Archer then grafts his face onto Troy at gunpoint, the few people who knew about the top secret mission are then all killed.  From this point on of course Castor Troy is played by Travolta.  I won't give away any more of the plot but what follows is both hilarious and disturbing, both leading men are superb, but Cage perhaps just steals the show, as he gradually becomes trapped in Troy's body (as Archer).  A great plot, an all star cast and superb acting make this action thriller a classic, like most great action films, there are great high budget chase scenes, hilarious moments (usually courtesy of Travolta as Castor Troy) and excellent drama.  Instead of ridiculing the plot, watch this with an open mind and you will see a superb action film, which I believe to be one of the best of all time",

The American novelist Edith Wharton spent most of her professional life in Europe. \"The Reef\" exemplifies her close observation of Americans in France, their inner lives and social conflicts.    On his way to France to see his beloved, the widowed Anna Leath (outstanding perfomance by the always beautiful and talented Sela Ward), Charles Darrow (Timothy Dalton-former James Bond) receives a telegram telling him not to come due to an \"unexpected obstacle.\" As time passes and he doesn't receive an explanation for the delay, he experiences growing feelings of disappointment and humiliation.     As he waits undetermined as to whether to go back to London or to press forward, he encounters Sophy Viner, a recently unemployed servant of a woman whose dinners he once attended. She is on her way to Paris to look up old friends and to pursue a theatrical career. Darrow, who feels sorry for himself and the loss he thinks he is about to suffer, finds himself manipulating Sophy into staying with him to attend the theatre and finally into a short liaison. He is unaware that she has fallen in love with him and his kindness in her hour of uncertainty.    Four months later, Anna Leath eagerly anticipates Darrow's arrival. During the walk they had in the garden, Anna expresses her love for Charles.    Anna: \"I'm not a naive young girl. I know...of course I KNOW...but there are things a woman feels...when what she knows doesn't make any difference. It's not that I want you to explain--I mean about that particular evening. It's only that I want you to know the whole of my feeling. I didn't know what it was till I saw you again. I never dreamed I should say such things to you!\"     Charles: \"I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!but now that you have said it.... the only thing that matters is that we are here together and I want you to be my wife.\"    Anna is also excited because her stepson, Owen Leath, wants to do something that they know will upset his aristocratic, old-fashioned grandmother; he wants to marry Anna's daughter's governess, who is none other than Sophy Viner.    Darrow and Sophy's secret is safe with one another, yet Darrow is faced by the uncomfortable fact that the ignorant Anna wants him to support Owen's choice of a woman he knows to be unsuitable but whom he pities. He tries to convince Sophy that Owen is not right for her. \"You'd rather I didn't marry any friend of yours,\" she says \"not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact.\" She is a painful reminder that both of them have broken social conventions.    This is a outsanding movie for people who appreciate understanding the complex nature of human behavior. The movie finishes with these lines:    \"What I meant was that when you've lived a little longer you'll see what complex blunderers we all are: how we're struck blind sometimes, and mad sometimes--and then, when our sight and our senses come back, how we have to set to work, and build up, little by little, bit by bit, the precious things we'd smashed to atoms without knowing it. Life's just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits.\"     Overall this movie is a truly outstanding movie with excellent performances.",

If childrearing were this easy, us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick! (I noticed Emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere). Can I please borrow it, Ms. Thompson?     My daughter and I were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself, Emma Thompson. It was loosely based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and who better to play the plum role of Nanny McPhee, than Ms. Thompson? One thing though, did disappoint me. Nanny McPhee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end--that my daughter and I wondered why Mr. Brown couldn't have married her?     Angela Lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity Aunt Adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced Mr. Brown into taking a bride. It was hilarious how, while he was wooing the opportunist Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things. Colin Firth as Mr. Brown was dynamic. So was the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). And, in the end, everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale, snow in August, and all. Kirk Jones, directed.

            "input": "Bleak and despairing.... . This is a great film, but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of Eastwood's career.  Many have said that Clint's film, Million Dollar Baby, was depressing.  That film was sad, but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it.  This film has nothing like that.  The 3 boyhood friends, played by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon, have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when Penn's daughter is murdered.  After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.  Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.  While at first you feel sympathy for Penn's character, you realise slowly that Penn is really a cruel, brutal man.  Bacon is very good as the detective, the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced, even though his wife has left recently, and he is a typically cynical detective.  The film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous, dark note, with Kevin Bacon giving Penn a \"I know what kind of person you really are\" at the end of the film.  This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.  It has the marks of a great tragedy, because like all tragedies, things never worked out for the best, they seemed to have worked out for the worst, but we're really not sure.  Great film....",

Like others have said, this production is totally rushed and they made some weird cuts.  -The face value acting doesn't go deep enough into the characters. While all these performers are skilled individuals, I was not impressed with their acting. However, this could be partially the fault of the director as well.  -The lip synching was a huuuuuuge disappointment!  -I don't understand what the deal is with the adults playing lost boys. Yes, adult performers can often perform more sophisticated choreography, but a certain nostalgia and innocence is brought to the production when actual kids are invovled.    With all that said, I think that kids would love this video. However, as a musical theatre student there are several shortcomings to this production overall. Nice musical, so-so interpretation. :",

I've just endured an unpleasant half hour trawling through the myriad reviews of \"Grand Canyon\", that are so misinformed as to be laughable.    Aside from the fact that the New York Times may have awarded this the \"worst film of all time\" (in a year that \"Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves\" was released?? - please!) I find these attitude of such reviewers quite lamentable.  Grand Canyon is a magnificent film - and absolutlely NOT just the purview of \"New Agers\"!  Anyone who has studied film to even a marginal degree will recognise the greatness in Grand Canyon. No, it's not \"The Godfather\"... yet it is still one of the finest films of its time.  To those it touches (and there are many), it is unforgettable.    Kasdan had a vision that was unfortunately ahead of its time (and still appears to be in 2006, judging from some of the reviews here!).  Certainly not \"The Big Chill\", Grand Canyon is a far more nuanced work - to those who understand its subtleties, it is sublime - to those still struggling to comprehend the mysteries, magic and meaning of our existance here, I can see how it might appear impenetrable or pretentious.  That is no fault of the film itself - just as \"Deuce Bigalow\" is speaking to its chosen audience of prepubertal adolescents, so is Grand Canyon attempting to connect with those humans who choose to delve beneath the flimsy facade of modern existance. To the opinion-makers, it will naturally slip under their radar; don't let that be a reason for you missing this unmissable film.    To anyone considering this film, I implore you - do not be distracted by the inane ramblings of posters who wouldn't understand a truly meaningful film if they fell over it.  Grand Canyon is for a select audience - it will never be widely popular; as if that were any true marker of what is important!  Grand Canyon stands tall as one of the great achievements of the 1990s - watch it, and be moved.  Watch it, and see a reflection of the world we currently find ourselves in - striving for answers, yearning for meaning... and looking all the while for the magic that defines our existance.

If you took everything out of an early 80's Woody Allen film EXCEPT the repugnant parts, you'd get \"Fall,\" and it's made me a devoted Eric Schaeffer fan.    What's so amazing about it all is the sheer self-centered wish-fulfillment that Schaeffer indulges in.  It's so cool!  Every single character in the movie exists only as a vehicle to convey to his character how incredibly great he is -and why not?!  He has two female friends who we know almost nothing about except that they're constantly impressed with his life and abilities as a lover.  He's got the supermodel lover who ultimately dumps him only because he's TOO cool, too hot, too real for her.      I'm not kidding.  You must see this.    Then there's the sex.  Schaeffer's character (who, like Shaeffer, is a NYC cab driver who had an affair with a married supermodel who ultimately dumped him) is so amazingly incredible as a lover that he makes his supermodel climax WITHOUT TOUCHING HER!  If that's not cool enough, his two lady friends then spend time marveling at this, about how great it is that he did that WITHOUT TOUCHING HER!  Wow!  Later, she actually  violates HIM with the aid of a toy, but once again it's HER who climaxes, thanks to his incredible dirty-talk and overall amazingness.  This guy's a dynamo, and thankfully there isn't a frame of the film that isn't devoted to showing that or having one of the other characters tell him that.    As I said, he gets dumped eventually, just like in real life.  But Schaeffer wants us to know the truth, that it's because he's too great and she's ultimately too shallow and loves him too intensely.  Schaeffer even imagines his lover's husband as a sexless idiot and gives him the line \"Maybe I'm shallow and superficial, but...\"  The husband then goes on to acknowledge that he can't compete with whoever this incredible lover-man is, but that he'll \"be there\" if she changes her mind and chooses the shallow, easy path.  Eric's \"character\" is just THAT good.    For anyone who, like me, lives in a world where the only obstacles are the fact that some people resent how incredible I am and that the world revolves around me instead of them... this movie is for US",

The characters and their odd mannerisms made this film a success, in my view. One of my coworkers lent me this movie, promising me that I'd like it - he was right. It is both funny and tragic, though a bit exaggerated (but it's a MOVIE, where life circumstances do not have to be totally realistic).     Most people can relate to Office Space, even if they don't have a cubicle-based job. I happen to have a cubicle-based job, though I recently moved from a rather large cubicle to an office, which I share with another coworker (there is a gray cubicle wall dividing it). It's not so bad though.  Anyway, the main character, Peter Gibbons, lacks motivation in his career and is fed up with a number of business practices. But he doesn't quit his job - he just stops working.  Doing nothing is his ideal life.    The rap music is a nice touch.    Now back to my favorite character, Milton, who repeatedly says that he \"could set the building on fire\" whenever things get too rough.  He is pathetic yet likeable, and I felt sorry for him when he didn't get any cake at the party. Everyone keeps passing it around, and he watches the cake get smaller and smaller until it is completely gone. And his desk is moved numerous times, which really irritates him. Eventually, he moves down to the basement, where it is dark and lonely.  His boss comes down to ask him to kill the cockroaches (\"That would be terrific\"), even though it's not Milton's job.  His distinctive \"Excuse me...\" protests are rarely heard. He is being used by the company, no one respects him, no one listens to him.  I'd burn the building down too",

Patriots. Even if you ain't that into sports, maybe just inspirational films that put a huge sh** eating grin on your face... this is a DVD to own (at least to check out..)  I of course was issued a copy of this after the Superbowl win in 2002, being from New England, but only dug it out recently to view it. Besides telling the story in detail about the season, game for game, it is also produced very well, by using the real NFL film footage, that is much more in depth than what we all saw on TV back when it happened. Right on the sidelines with the players, you get to watch (half the time you can see that they are almost as amazed with themselves as we were)  I guess I should spare the story, because it is written in every other review here, and really its much better shown on the DVD, but to remember the state of the team at that point...  Last place underdogs the WHOLE season. Even as the team barrel rolled and got bigger and better, game for game, no one believed they would do it (maybe us New Englanders did, but we were still crossing our fingers pretty damned hard).. but everytime the stakes got higher, the team got hotter (not to mention a few divine miracles, like the enormous hurricane during the Raiders game)  You just gotta watch this thing, and see how crazy the team really got, spectacular moves all over. This is one of those sports stories that should grace the big screen... a story you couldn't make up.  Rock on PATS!     P.S. Regarding the tribute to 9/11, god bless to all....  but I REALLY hate U2",

I enjoyed the plot, enjoyed the action, enjoyed the suspense, and enjoyed the acting by Michael Douglas and Brittany Murphy. I always am up for watching excellent movies like Ghost World, Frailty, American History X, Seven, etc.. but movies like that are hard to come around. In comes movies like Don't Say A Word. They're predictable, even lame, but I still find them to be fun and amusing. Maybe if you people would lower your dam* expectations, maybe you'd enjoy movies like this. This is worth a rent if you don't expect seeing a best picture nominee. But, all the reviewers on Amazon obviously were thinking: \"the next silence of the lambs! The next Seven!

After watching the fabulous bonus features on this DVD (a biography of William 'Wild Bill' Wellman with observations by Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter, another bio of \"Track\" author Walter Van Tilburg Clark, a look at actual mountain lions and their habitat, and more), I realized I held a 'minority opinion' of the film, itself, compared to many of the reviewers you'll read, here; I think it is stagy, lacks the sense of dread and palpable suspense of the novel, and doesn't 'hold up' as well as most of the director's work.    A tale of a dysfunctional family at it's boiling point, and the impact a nearly primordial panther has, in changing their lives, the characters, with the exception of always watchable Robert Mitchum, as the domineering middle son, are all either boring, frustratingly indecisive, or downright unlikable. Oldest son William Hopper, best-known as 'Paul Drake' in television's \"Perry Mason\", is the dreamer, who 'bonds' with the environment, but lacks the instinctive power to defeat the cat, and never comes across as more than wishy-washy; bitter spinster sister Teresa Wright offers a one-note portrayal that soon becomes grating; youngest son Tab Hunter is so wimpy that you quickly lose interest in him; Philip Tonge, the loquacious alcoholic father, whose drinking problem, in the novel, is tragic, here becomes a stereotyped comic drunk, with hidden bottles of liquor providing 'comic relief'; Diana Lynn, as Hunter's girl, tries hard, but never seems more than a minor character in the proceedings; even legendary Beulah Bondi, as the greedy, Bible-spouting, mean-spirited mother, seems to simply channel her 'bad mom' portrayal from the \"What if?\" sequence of \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Worst of all, ex-Little Rascal Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer, encased in phony-looking 'old age' make-up to 'pass' as a 100-year-old ranch hand/medicine man, looks neither believable, or comfortable in the role.    With a farm set that looks patently artificial (and obviously on a sound stage), the outdoor scenes, shot at Mount Rainier, must take up the slack; sadly, despite the creativity in using high contrasts to make the colors achieve a 'black and white' look, the book's greatest asset, the constant, frightening 'unseen' presence of the malevolent cat was, to me, never achieved, despite a Mitchum monologue as he gradually succumbs to helpless fear; in fact, Hunter's final confrontation with the cat is handled so 'routinely' that you can't understand what all the fuss was about!

It had been a big hit on Broadway in the 40's but predated the civil rights movement.  Coppala had the task of updating it for 1968.    Fred Astaire is 69 in the title role and this was his last role dancing and singing. This was the first times since the beginning of Astaire's career that he didn't have control over the direction of his musical numbers. Coppala was an inexperienced director and fired Hermes Pan, Fred's chorographer. He admits that it was his fault that  Fred's big number in the film didn't come out the way should.    Petula Clark is wonderful as Astaire's daughter. Tommy Steele who was also in \"The Happiest Millionare\" and \"Half a Sixpence\" plays a part typical of his personality.   There is very little chemistry between Petula Clark and her love interest, Dan Franck.  PLOT:  Finian(Astaire) is an Irishman that steals a pot of gold from Og (Tommy Steele). He heads toRainbow Valley, which is right next to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he thinks burying the gold will multiply his riches.  He meets some people, Woody and Silent Sue, and gives them money to save their land from the bigot senator (Keenan Wynn).  In return he wants part of their land to secretly bury the gold.  Og follows Finian to get his gold back. He is turning into a mortal because he has lost his pot of gold.  Meanwhile, Finian's daughter(Petula Clark) is falling in love with a local, Woody (Dan Franck).    Nicely restored with great special features.

Burt Kwouk  as Cato is given more to do in his small scene with Wass and you wonder why he isnt in more of the film.

Sam Neil was incredible as Reilly. He showed a man who was elegant, charming and yet so ruthless you could almost see the ice in his veins. He doesn't have a problem with killing and he doesn't have a problem with leaving an incompetent agent behind either. He was a womanizer who could be the ultimate romantic in one scene then simply walk away in the next. One of the most touching scenes in the series is when Reilly's wives and sweethearts all clamor for news of him. He's treated some of these women horribly. One he's turned into a hopeless drunk but they still can't get enough of him. In another scene, one of his conquests calmly faces death rather than betray him. After her death Reilly, the series implies, carries her earrings, the only thing he has left of her on him for the rest of his life.    Reilly has been called the grandfather of the Jame Bond character because by the time young Ian Flemming came along Reilly was a legend in the British spy world. Flemming denied this but Reilly's relationship with his spymaster is very reminiscent of Bond and M and of course there all those women.     Everything about this series is great. The acting is all top notch, the costumes are perfect, the music, especially Romance of the Gadfly, Reilly's theme is unforgettable. This series came on TV when I was a kid and I would rush home every week to get all my homework and any other chore done so I could watch Reilly in peace.

            "input": "19th Century Incredibles . There have been far too many sequels to too many original films that were much more stellar. \"The Legend of Zorro\", unfortunately, is another.     Whereas the 1998 original was more along the lines of a blockbuster, this 2005 sequel has proven to be lackluster.   Antonio Banderas, as Alejandro De la Vega,has taken his late father-in-law's name, and is now more at ease in his role as a nobleman of mid-19th-century California. He is still donning the mask and making sojourns to help the oppressed and dispossessed of the region. But he now has a wife and child to consider and the tensions between the swashbuckler and his equally daring young wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones)mount when she begins to fear for the safety of their son, Joaquin.    As Joaquin, Adrian Alonso reveals that the genes for the spunk and cunning of the De La Vegas have not worn thin as he defies authority to help defeat the villians of the film. At intervals, the family become the 19th century's precursor to the animated Incredibles with the skills and technology available to them.   As another reviewer noted, the story loses its credibility when Elena and Alejandro divorce due to her concerns for her son's safety. This would have been extremely rare  in the 19th century, and unheard of in a Catholic country at that time.    Elena reunites with a former acquaintance she met during her years in Spain, a French nobleman named Armand(a piercing-eyed, striking Rufus Sewell) in whose house she and her son become guests, and whom Elena finds to have sinister designs on California, not unlike the abductor she had believed to be her father for many years.   The \"Zorro\" franchise recycles Tony Amendola as a priest trying to teach students such as Joaquin, whereas he had been a devious henchman to Don Rafael in the 1998 film, and lets us glimpse Mary Crosby, a quarter century after the height of her popularity, in a non-speaking role as a Governor's wife, reassuring us that there are no small roles, only small actors.   While it has a few impressive moments, the script is a tired rehash of the original theme, and the outcome is predictable, literally hinging on the ability to get on the right track.   Young Adrian Alonso appears to have a bright future ahead of him, and I hope that Antonio and Catherine enjoyed their onscreen reunion.   But generally, it simply does not have the sizzle of its 1998 predecessor, and there was a lot of time and money that could have been better spent",

            "input": "He named his dog after Ronald Reagan. . This was one of those mythological films that I speak so highly of in other reviews. This was a gem hidden in the darkness. Looking at the cover, you would never guess that this would be such a powerhouse of a film, but let me be the first to say that it was.     Berenger and Winger are amazing in their roles.  Winger giving the best performance that I have ever seen her do, while Berenger takes a character riddled with evil and makes him human.  When I first began this film, I was expecting a very true Hollywood production.  One that would be dark at first, but all of the sudden create this happy world at the end.  This film did nothing close to that.  What was amazing about this film was that it let the audience make it's own decisions.  Not much was handed to you on a silver platter.      Upon the first ten minutes of this film, you would probably assume that it was a love story. It is anything BUT a love story.  It is a crime/thriller/drama film, and quite possibly one of the strongest that I have seen in some time.  There are some scenes in this film that I couldn't believe I was watching.  The sheer brilliance of the director left me wondering if this film was really made in 1988.  The cinematography was outstanding.  There is one scene that stands out the most in my mind.  After Berenger tries to \"put down\" his dying horse, he can't pull himself to shoot a living creature, so he has his side-kick do it. After it is done, he runs out into the rain behind Berenger wrapped in a plastic tarp. The image here is of the devil riding close behind.  It is so vivid and so beautifully done that you can't help to wonder what that may represent.  There are a couple of scenes very similar to this as well.     Now, this isn't a film without some small flaws.  The young girl was annoying. Perhaps I find young children in these types of films always to be annoying, but in this case it was especially bad.  Also, there were some dopey scenes to this film. There were some parts that I felt I was the director of the film watching some bad lines happen between Berenger and Winger ... but it was only a couple.     Betrayed ends like an open-ended question.  It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated.  It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film.  Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist.  But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever.  The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy? Dark and impressive ... WOW, I am lucky to have found this one.     Grade:  ***** out of ****",

(I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment.",

            "input": "Water-logged . Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.    In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)      The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- \"Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again,\" attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.     Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.",

Wallace is a daft inventor who, in this story, is running a humane pest removal service named \"Anti-Pesto\" and Gromit is his intelligent and loyal dog.  Gromit is the one with the common sense and is the only one in the whole film who seems to know what is going on.  And Gromit never says a word.  However, he is quite expressive and we always know clearly what is on his mind and why he has the concerns he has.    The town is concerned about the rabbits eating their vegetable gardens because the annual giant vegetable growing contest is about to be held.  The sponsor is a local hereditary heir, Lady Tottington (wonderfully voiced by Helena Bonham Carter).  She is being courted by the scoundrel Victor Quatermaine (voice amazingly by Ralph Fiennes).  He also loves to shoot rabbits, but this bothers her ladyship and once she meets Wallace she becomes more taken with him and his humane ways.    Wallace comes up with the idea of trying to condition the rabbits to not want to eat the vegetables and things have to be stopped before the process is completed.  The rest of the movie is working out all the crazy details of the unexpected results of the partial experiment.      Lots of fun and quite a visual treat and a stop-action / animation triumph.

However, you can probably do much better picking out films your kids will watch than this collection. That's not to say that there aren't some great yet silly films in the batch, because there are. Next I describe each film in descending order of quality.    UHF (1989) - This is a great film starring Weird Al Yankovic as a directionless young man whose uncle gives him a rundown TV station to manage. His unconventional programming turns things around for himself and the station.     Cooley High (1975) - This is a great film for all ages, and was the basis for the sitcom \"What's Happening\", although it only faintly resembles it. It is set in south-side Chicago in the mid 60's, and concerns a group of high school friends that have numerous comic encounters, but there is also some tragedy involved in the plot.    Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) - The first one was very funny and fresh, and Keanu Reeves will always be Ted as far as I'm concerned, even if he winds up doing Shakespeare at some point. The plot concerns two slackers who are about to fail history that are given some help from a time traveller from the future. The only problem is that it is so steeped in 80's pop culture that your kids may not get half the jokes.    Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) - The second one is still funny, it just seems to try harder and not get quite the same comic effect as the first.     The rest of the movies are under the National Lampoon label.    Dorm Daze (2003) - One of National Lampoon's better college farce movies, with the plot set up by a series of silly misunderstandings. The closest thing you're going to get to \"Animal House\" 25 years after the fact.    Going the Distance (2004) - A Canadian version of Roadtrip. This movie was better than I expected, with a lot of good interaction between the main characters, but still not that great even for a teen farce.    Class Reunion (1982) - This movie had all the ingredients to be funny, but it just bored me, even in 1982. Top that off with all of the 80's and even 70's pop culture references, and I don't think it would do much for today's kids.    The last three movies are just awful - \"Movie Madness\", \"Gold Diggers\", and \"Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj\". I won't even bother to describe them. When I say they're bad, I'm saying they are boring and completely unfunny. If you force your kids to sit through these three films as part of their summer break, they'll be looking forward to going back to school.    The end result is you have three good to excellent films that are all older movies, four mediocre to OK films, and three horrible movies. I think you can do much better at entertaining your older teenagers/college kids than this collection",

When Tru Calling's pilot started I originally thought, \"well, this show will be cancelled soon\". it was messy, unoriginal & kinda lame. but that's how it was supposed to start. then the 2nd episode was more believable & was a little better in every area that Pilot lacked! & from then to the middle of the season, it had its high points & its lows, Closure being one of my fav episodes! then, enter Jason Priestley as Jack, I'm thinking, why on Earth is he on this show? they must be desperate or something. but his character suddenly started making the show more interesting, things started moving faster & the show became darker, there were more things going on in the episodes & by the finale, Tru Calling hit its high point! everything was looking good for the show! but had they started out that good, maybe Fox would've gave it a better promotion. One of my fav moments is in Death Becomes Her when Jack saves Harrison's car by calling the thief's bluff. & from that moment, you have to know there's something up with Jack. especially after the audience presumably found out that he got a girl to commit suicide by making a phone call to her parents telling them about her constant gambling. & then with some help from Tru, Davis has to re-find out what he did on day one & tell her that Jack also relives days which in the next episode we find out why. He's there to stop her! & after getting Luc(Mat Bomber) killed, he takes a vacation & hopes that Tru will stop saving lives that are suppose to die. but Tru doesn't give up & when Jack comes back, things start getting tricky.    Perfect Storm- 5/5 Jack's return makes it difficult for her to save the life of a cop who died in a white squal but Jack sending her back out in the water at night makes it even harder after Davis saved her the first time by making a \"phony\" phone call. & Davis gets a replacement psychiatrist & things don't go so well with her.    Grace- 5/5 Jack sets Tru up for murder & things hit rock-bottom before they get better for her.    In the Dark- 4/5 In one of the more obvious deaths for the viewers anyway, Tru is forced to figure out who died after a party is thrown by her brother at the morgue. Jack keeps Tru on her feet & makes her go on a wild goose chase.    The Last Good Day- 5/5 My fav episode of Tru Calling. Everything changes when Jack gets asked for help from a girl who commited suicide. now the only question was, why? & why does the relive day feel so cold to Tru?    Enough- 5/5 Tru crosses the line when she tries to save life of her boyfriend Jensen as Jack tries to stop her & even Davis warns her of the reprecussions of saving the life of someone who doesn't ask for her help. She shouldn't be able to choose, it's up to fate. but she doesn't listen & something severe does happen in return.    Twas the Night Before Xmas, Again- 4/5 Harrison finds out about his dad's alliance with Jack but before he warn Tru, her day restarts. Tru reluctantly lets Jack help her in solving a murder case possibly after an old cadaver asks for help.     It's an ok ending cause it at least it isn't a cliff hanger but it's a shame it didn't get a whole season & stupid shows that shouldn't be around cause their just getting stupid(cough*the oc*cough) are still on??? but Fox screwed Tru Calling, see my review for the first season for more about how ticked off I am at fox, lol.    plus some features on the show & I think anyone should get into this show! the second season could've been so great had they had a whole season! these six episodes are worth your money just the same! a memorable show too bad it wasn't given a real chance cause it did become something great!",

Evolution only disagrees with written texts of creationism. One needs to look well beyond.    If I were God I would want my people to be able to neither prove or disprove my existence...yet I would leave some doubts or unanswerable questions for man to ponder...like science that breaks down at the moment of the Big Bang.     Those that study the human body have barely glimpsed the complexities of this evolved life form and I find I have a gnawing feeling about how adaptive evolution alone got us all the way here. A bit of doubt leaves that door to God open, albeit not a god exactly like one's holy book might have posited.     Many great scientists are believers of sorts so I find atheists to be arrogant, and agnostics perhaps closer to the truth.

            "input": "A classic tale of adventure, true love, and REVENGE! . When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...     What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...     If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).     Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece \"Dance of Curse\" for instance. It reminds one a lot of \"Duel of the Fates\", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode \"mystic eyes\". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.     Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.",

Unfortunately, after the requisite \"beefcake shot\" of Rick, the plot of the movie slides downhill into Bad Soap Opera Land.      Rick CAN act and I have seen him give some amazing performances.  That said, this movie doesn't show his skills in the best light.  Mostly because the writing is HORRID but also because his co-star (Janet Eiber) is not much of an actress.  Rick does his best, but he's left hanging by a bad script and a lame director.      Now, if you're looking for some great Rick Springfield tunes, then this movie won't disappoint you in that respect.  The soundtrack should have won a Grammy.  There are fantastic songs from Rick (one of my personal favorites \"Stand Up\" is fun and energetic and the hit \"Love Somebody\" is terrific concert footage), and other very good artists contribute including Peter Gabriel.

Foreman stars as Julie, a valley girl who, along with her boyfriend Tommy (Michael Bowen) are the most popular couple at Valley High.  However, Julie is getting bored with Tommy because she thinks he's ignoring her.  So, she breaks up with him (on a mall escalator, no less).  After the break-up, Julie and her friends Samantha (Tina Theberge), Loryn (Elizabeth Daily), and Suzie (Michelle Meyrink) head to the beach.  It is here that Julie gets her first glimpse of Randy (Cage).    Unfortunately for Julie, she and her now ex-boyfriend Tommy are both supposed to go to a party at Suzie's house.  Randy's friend Fred overhears the plans for the party, and he and Randy plan to crash the party.  Sure enough, Fred and Randy show up uninvited at Suzie's house, but Julie is immediately intrigued by Randy.  The two start talking, but Tommy and his thug friends interfere and throw Randy out of the house.  Now very mad, Randy and Fred go back to the party.  Randy waits in the bathroom for Julie to come in, and the two decide to leave together.  Julie convinces Samantha to come along.    Randy takes Julie \"over the hill' to Hollywood and shows her some of his favorite places to hang out.  The sparks soon begin to fly between Randy and Julie, and they start going steady, much to the disgust of Julie's friends.  Their relationship goes along very well for a while, but one night at a sleepover, Julie's friends tell her that she must make a choice between them and Randy.  They convince her to get back together with Tommy and dump Randy.   Julie goes along with it, and starts to be very mean to Randy, but does she really feel that way, or is she just covering up her true feelings for the sake of her friends?  Will Julie and Randy get back together, or will Julie do what her friends want her to?    This is a great movie.  I've seen it several times on VHS, and I was thrilled to find it on DVD. Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman are great in their roles as Julie and Randy.  The supporting actors are very good as well.  This movie was released when I was in high school, so it brings back a lot of memories for me.  The great 80s music played throughout the movie is a huge plus, too.      I give this movie my highest recommendation. The story is excellent, and the acting is very good.  Take a trip back to the 80s with this great movie.  \"Its awesome\"",

Beat Takeshi's violence, however, is not gratuitous, but righteous anger in action.

If the warrior immortalized in Book of Five Rings or Gitopanishad has an equivalent in modern times, surely it would be in this strange character, this Japanese-style Colonel Kurtz in Hana-Bi.

Paparazzi (Paul Abascal, 2004)    Paparazzi is best known for being Icon Production's first released film after the mighty (and mightily money-making) majesty that was The Passion of the Christ. The Icon connection, however, is where any similarity between the two films comes to an abrupt and jarring end. Where Passion pushed all sorts of envelopes for mainstream American film, Paparazzi is simple and formulaic, never rearing its ugly head from the morass of revenge fantasy in which it finds itself bogged.    Bo Laramie (Pitch Black's Cole Hauser, looking and acting more and more like his dad by the day) has gone overnight from nobody to superstar thanks to his film Adrenaline Force. Subsequently, he's packed up his family and moved to the suburbs of LA to be closer to the set for his new picture (predictably, Adrenaline Force 2). Along with the closeness of the commute, however, comes the mobs of paparazzi. Laramie runs afoul of photojournalist Rex Harper (the always-slimy Tom Sizemore), who convinces three of his friends to help him put Laramie in his place. In doing so, however, they inadvertently cause an accident that lands both Laramie's wife (The Craft temptress Robin Tunney) and son (Jurassic Park III's Blake Michael Bryan) in the hospital. Cue revenge-fantasy music here.    The film is watchable, as one would normally expect from this sort of action film. The roles are acted capably enough, though two-dimensionally; it's almost as if Hauser, who's made his living mostly playing guys like Rex Harper, only knows how to play the hero as a square-jawed Tarzan type. That's not surprising in an action flick, though, and can be forgiven most times (look at Predator 2). Where the film becomes moronic to the point of offensive, though, is in the accident scene itself, which is so obviously ripped off from tales of Princess Diana's death as to be insulting to the intelligence of the average viewer. *",

Written by playwright Noel Coward, directed by David Lean, starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, and set to the impassioned music of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2, this is a story about two people living quietly dull lives, married to equally dull spouses, who suddenly find someone interesting to share a brief encounter with. This masterful film shows how hungry normal, ordinary people are for the feeling that life is exciting, and that there is someone who finds them interesting to share it with. The normal avenue for such a relationship would have been their own spouses; but they are unable to find it there, somehow. So they find it one day, accidentally, illicitly, secretly, dishonestly, soul wrenchingly in a stranger. Now these quietly dull souls become quietly desperate souls, as they realize that stolen love comes with a price, and that what had promised to bring them boundless happiness is instead bringing them more sorrow than they have ever known before.    I found many parallels in this movie with other quietly desperate people that I know: friends of mine who have tried to find happiness illicitly, secretly, dishonestly in work, sex, alcohol, drugs, co-dependent relationships, etc. I think this movie has a powerful message for our times. It is not about a love relationship that was doomed because of a stricter social and moral code than we have today; it is about the emptiness and madness of stolen love of any kind. I love the way the film ends, with repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation. This film is a timeless gem.    Waitsel Smit",

I think it is very well done and it is very inspirational.      However, for anyone who wants to know the TRUE story of what happened with Escalante and his students, purchase the book \"Escalante: The Best Teacher in America\" by Jay Mathews.  The film leads you to believe that Escalante took students who didn't know how to multiply and then in the course of one school year made those same students score 5s on the AP Calculus test.  This is far from what really happened.  Escalante spent YEARS developing a program and he made sure he had proper courses that led to an understanding of Calculus.    There is one other noticeable bit of fiction in the film.  The movie portrays it as the testing company (ETS) accused the students of cheating simply because the company was racist and they felt the students at Garfield High School couldn't have possibly known the material.  The true story is that some answers on the AP tests from Garfield were noticeably similar.  About 12 students made the same exact errors on one particular problem, and that is what made ETS suspicious.    So once again, a well done film, and while is it \"based on a true story\", it is far from a true story",

An excellent swimmer, Johnny Weissmuller makes the swimming scenes seem effortless and believable. Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane provides elegance, as a gentle yet brave and courageous woman, who falls in love with a man, king of the jungle, and yet completely unaware of civilization. The house Tarzan builds for her is a marvel of progress, with the latest technological advancements... in a rudimentary... simple... basic construction. When Edgar Rice Burroughs created Tarzan he played on our survival instincts, and surfaced the innate fears of confronting savage beasts, and yet, the fantasy that we can become friends with all jungle creatures.     Tarzan and His Mate  - Simply best in class. It explores how life should have been for Adam & Eve... in love, living in paradise, respecting nature, and living in complete harmony with the environment. Not spoiling and accepting the simple things offered by our planet Earth.       Tarzan Escapes  - From civilization, Jane's cousins visit the Mutia Escarpment, only to realize that she has found true love, family, and home in Africa. The marvel of the home created by Tarzan is highlighted, with the elephant-powered elevator becoming a fascinating process to watch.    Tarzan Finds a Son!  - Here we meet a new addition to the family, played by Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Both Tarzan and Jane now have a play pal, and he does a magnificent job at allowing the audience to see how we can grow up in this environment and learn survival skills that keep him active, healthy, and self-assured. Great for a younger audience, adding fun and adventure to this wonderful set.    Tarzan's New York Adventure  One of the best scenes ever filmed is when Johnny Weissmuller dives off the Washington bridge, and makes it all look possible, doable... and easy. What precision! This movie is fun and Cheetah provides many a laugh. The struggle between good and evil are played to perfection in this series, where those in search for profit and wealth, are always trying to take advantage of the many natural treasures that surround Tarzan's simple life, and it is rewarding to see how the hero never gives in to avarice, defending and maintaining his world in its natural state.     We loved the set... and when we visit the zoo... or go to the Circus... we find ourselves looking at elephants and monkeys and saying... \"Simba... ungawa!\" \"Simba... ungawa!\" Would highly recommend acquiring this set",

            "input": "When Life Is Not Enough? . This film seems to want to have it both ways - offering the premise that not all disability is disposable - just Sampedro's.    An incredible amount of talent and creativity went into a film that pays homage to ... well, plainly put - a man that was too petulant to live. The movie presents Ramon Sampedro - a talented, intelligent and articulate  man as someone who ultimately proves to be a self-pitying whiner.     It was not that he was not capable of living a life of accomplishment and satisfaction - he simply refused to. Despite the acclaim and admiration that his writing had brought to him, despite the devotion of those around him that loved and cared for him, Sampedro seems a bit like the child who gathers his marbles up from the playground and marches home because someone hadn't played by his rules. (Refusing a wheelchair? C'mon!)    Granted, the stress, humiliation and despair of being a quadriplegic cannot be minimalized nor discounted. However, giving up on what you may have once hoped your life would be for what it ultimately becomes proves to be difficult for all of us - no matter what the size or nature of our own personal challenges.    (Oddly enough the very limitations that he views as untenable are most likely the factors that pushed him to reach inside himself and find a voice that brought him such attention and celebrity. Imagine the platform that was his ... and was thrown away)     Yes, yes - allow the man to end his life if he is incapable of recognizing the gift that he squandered; let us be done with him if he so chooses. We should not, however, celebrate his cowardice - the easy out - this foolish waste of something precious. What an insult this film seems to those who struggle quietly everyday with half the talents, abilities or the emotional resources of devoted family and friends that were at Sampedro's disposal. Those gifts for which others could only envy, Sampedro discarded in self-indulgent and careless abandon. The joys that others could only dream about, he chose to reject.    It would be better instead for us to triumph with Stephen Hawking (\"Brief History of Time\"), Christy Brown (\"My Left Foot\") or Helen Keller (\"The Miracle Worker\") - each of whom had to face the equal of the challenges that Sampedro faced, but did not cower in resignation or mawkish self-absorption. Instead they rose above the limitations (those imposed on them either by themselves or those around them) and made all our lives better for their struggle.",

As with the other reviewers of this film, I must agree that  in its restored and complete form, this is an outstanding  film.  The supplemental material is also quite interesting.  The themes in this film are just as relevant today as they  were when it was made.  Most anything else I could write would  be redundant with what others have written.    I will admit that at points I felt the film dragged a bit,  having made a point but not moving on.  Maybe I am just too  much a product of watching too many fast paced films of today.    One thing I find curious about this movie is the title.  Since  the main character is not Colonel Blimp and is really a much  deeper character than the cartoon character, I wonder why the  film was given the name it was.   I wonder how many people went  to see this movie expecting a comedy based on a cartoon character.    My minor quibbles aside, this is really an excellent film and  worth seeing.",

I origionaly didn't want to watch this film I mean come on a film starring Sandra Bullock but it was my girlfriend who suggested that I watch this film and said that I might like it and now I admit it was pretty good. Sandra Bullock plays a woman named Birdee Pruitt who believes to be happy with a perfect life until she appears on national television and hears her best friend confessing to an affair with her husband. She then leaves her married home and travels to her birth place in Texas where she begins to rebuild her life and relationships especialy with her mother and young daughter who hates Birdee. I was surprised that the film didn't have any cliche Hollywood moments and it dealt with human emotions and was realistic, Birdee has to overcome the humiliation and public betrayal she obviously has a lot of problems but soon Harry Connick jr.'s character comes along to hopefully win Birdee's heart since they knew each other from Highschool. The film was very uplifting and in a way it is a serious romantic drama with a bit of humor so I enjoyed this film alot and I didn't hesitate the fact that I like Sandy in these roles and everybody else gave a great performance and I hope that she stars in more films like this instead of those awful comedies, I highly recomend this film",

And, as many have already said in Amazon's ratings, this movie is not like Foer's book.  It is, unfailingly, cinema and with that in mind it should be judge upon cinematic criteria. Thus, although I will grant the impressive visual beauty of this movie (the cinematographer captures an oddity, serenity, and disturbance) I cannot agree with those who give it high marks.  The plot is sparse, as is much of the character development.  I am especially disappointed with the portrayal of Alex and his grandfather.  I found myself empathizing little with the grandfather or Alex in the movie's final dramatic scenes.  The grandfather's emotional turmoil seems underdeveloped as does Alex's reaction to his Grandfather's action.  Morevover, the parallels between the JSF character and the Ukranian characters seem forced.  The only things they share are contrived connections in the narrative's backstory.  Overall, I felt untouched by this movie.  And one last note, why is it even called \"Everything is Illuminated?\"  That title illuminates little within the movie",

Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody.  \"Equilibrium\" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin.  But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment.

Whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning Sting's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80's New Wave scene to Serious Jazz Artiste, the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there. Director Michael Apted delivers an ultra-slick production  with an \"A+\" grade in the cinematography, editing and sound departments as we follow Sting and his crack back up band (ex-Weather Report, Miles Davis players) rehearsing in a French chateau for a \"debut\" performance in Paris. Most of the material is from the outstanding \"Dream Of The Blue Turtles\" album (which Sting has yet to match since-this WAS his artistic peak, IMHO). There are some \"oh so precious\" moments-especially a sequence depicting a \"goofy\" photo-shoot in Paris, with Sting being chased through public squares (and most embarassingly, a public fountain-what, suddenly he's Anita Ekberg in \"La Dolce Vita\"? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez, who I really wished to see drop-kicked into the Seine. My favorite \"Spinal Tap\" moment: Sting's dictatorial manager (Miles Copeland, former Police svengali and founder/president of IRS Records) goes off on a set designer for her \"lack of imagination\" on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the Big Show, against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that Sting had told her he WANTED a \"Brechtian effect\". (You couldn't write something that funny.) The tardy yet belated release of the film on DVD should satisfy rock doc collectors with its excellent sonics,sparkling transfer and bonus videos from the period",

Found a copy to rent, but it's so good I want my own copy to keep! Couldn't find it anywhere to buy today, so I'm ordering it from Amazon now and thought I'd put in my two cents about how great it is. Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams are too priceless as the 15-year-old best friends who stumble unwittingly into the Watergate mess in 1972. They are befriended by Tricky Dick, who gives them jobs as Offical White House Dog Walkers of his famous dog \"Checkers\" in an attempt to please them so they won't talk about what they've seen (they don't know what they witnessed anyway, which is what makes it so funny). The entire cast is first rate and I haven't laughed this hard at a new comedy (new for ME, I mean) since I first saw \"Me, Myself & Irene\". This movie isn't nearly as crude in humor as the latter, but as far as the writing and the comedic talents of the fantastic cast, it ranks right up there with any of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sure to put you in a great mood!  :)  :) The simplistic premise of the movie could have made it go either way (either really great or really awful), but these actors made it fantastic to watch and must have certainly had a blast filming it. I don't know if the DVD has outtakes but I hope so; I bet they would be hilarious to see. I was holding my breath the last few seconds as I waited for the ending, hoping it was going to be worthy of the rest of the film, and was NOT dissapointed. Laughed my b**t off at the ending!! Give it a watch; if you love to laugh, and especially if you were a dreamy teenage girl in the 70's who covered her bedroom walls with posters of Bobby Sherman and David Cassidy (like I did!), you'll LOVE this movie.

There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life.  Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much.  I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie.

This is another in that rare grouping, running at an entertaining 12 minutes longer than the first.    This time we learn of the existence of a whole network of Spy Kids, and Carmen and Juni have to prove their mettle against a well heeled sister and brother duo from hell.    Their adventures take them to a mysterious island, invisible to radar, where \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" meets \"Sinbad\", \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Fantasy Island\".  Star turns by Ricardo Montalban as Carmen and Juni's grandfather, and Steve Buscemi as the nutty scientist, as well as cameos by Alan Cumming and Tony Shaloub increase the entertainment value fourfold.    The rival Spy Kids dialogue and superciliousness go against the grain sometimes, but the gadgetry is as brilliant as the first, even though they don't always work when needed.      Imagination rules here, and if you like those old adventure movies with fantastic creatures and swashbuckling heroes, you will like this one.  Better yet, adults can enjoy it without needing the excuse of having a child.    Amanda Richards, May 5, 2005",

Grateful Dead legend Jerry Garcia's daughter made this amateurish home video. While the topic of genetically modified foods is interesting, this video comes off as terribly one-sided hatchet job on the biotech industry and U.S. agriculture, in general. Monsanto is the main target of this film's attacks, but no one from the company is ever allowed to respond to the claims that it is trying to monopolize the pesticide and seed industries by buying up potential competitors and registering for patents on thousands of genetically engineered plant products. Instead, we're treated to the overzealous opinions of a few blowhards who don't have any idea of how to encourage research, development, and innovation in agriculture. The vague term of \"biodiversity\" is mentioned as some kind of virtue, but no explains its benefits. Actually, everyone is allowed to whine in this movie, from farmers to activists, but no one is ever allowed to respond to attacks. In one sequence, a farmer criticizes Monsanto. In another sequence, the U.S. government is criticized for subsidizing farmers (nevermind that every major industrial power subsidizes its farmers). Why not ask the farmer if he's dependent on government handouts, and how he justifies such subsidies? Why should farmers be immune to criticism? Please, let's get into the mix a little bit, and get to the bottom of these controveries!",

Glengarry Glen Ross is a superb drama directed by James Foley (At Close Range), and starring a powerful all-male cast including Al Pacino (Heat), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men), Ed Harris (A Beautiful Mind), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands), Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator), and Jonathon Pryce (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl).    The movie is an adaptation of the stage play written by David Mamet, who also helms the screenplay to the movie version. The thing that drew me most to Glengarry Glen Ross was the dialogue. And since I tried my hand at door-to-door sales, I felt very connected to the characters in the movie, especially Sheldon Levene, played remarkably by Lemmon. The presentation made by Alec Baldwin in the beginning of the film about what it takes to be a salesman hit me harder than an iron fist.    The movie is not just for salesmen (even though I find it mandatory for anybody who's considering a career in sales), but for everybody who appreciates real movies.    Recommended",

Watch the credits at the end for examples of what I'm talking about.    Because of this creative juxtaposition, KUNG POW manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own. It really does \"feel\" like a vintage martial arts film, yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd, it just wrings laughs out of you.    SIDELIGHT: The entire movie is dubbed, and Oedekerk also did all the voices for every character (except Whoa.)

            "input": "Do The Hustle:  Newman Makes Fast Eddie Felson A Hollywood Legend . Let's face it, what can I possibly say about Robert Rossen's exquisitely hard-edged classic that hasn't been said before?  \"The Hustler\" is an astounding and uncompromising drama that seems as fresh today as it did 45 years ago.  So often we'll look back at the classics--and, as is appropriate, they might seem dated.  Times change and that is reflected in cinema.  \"The Hustler,\" though, is one of the rare films that was so sophisticated, so intelligent, and so honestly raw--that its power has not been diminished by the years.  Set in a very unglamorous world of pool halls and back rooms, \"The Hustler\" is a testosterone fueled excursion into the life and pursuits of one of Hollywood's most notorious anti-heroes--Fast Eddie Felson.  Nominated for eight Oscars, this refreshingly adult film cemented Paul Newman's status as one of our greatest actors.    The story of \"The Hustler\" is surprisingly simplistic.  A brash young pool shark sets his sights on defeating one of the game's greatest players--Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason, at his best).  But getting up on Fats isn't enough--no, he wants to crush his opponent.  Eddie's naked and uncompromising drive eventually becomes his undoing as his winning streak turns to defeat.  Despondent and broke, Eddie aligns with an equally desperate love interest.  Sarah, played by Piper Laurie (never better), is a bitter alcoholic who has given up on life.  But her complicated romance with Eddie seems to hint at the possibility of new hope.  Eddie, however, can't change his spots overnight and an encounter with an unscrupulous manager (George C. Scott) just might get Eddie a second chance at Fats.  For good or for bad, it seems Eddie is destined to go down that road again.    Paul Newman imbues Eddie with much cockiness, bravado, arrogance, ambition, and even desperation.  In my opinion, it is Newman's best and most multi-layered performance.  This (along with \"Hud\") celebrated Newman as a new type of leading man--someone you could like and despise at once.  Morally questionable, perhaps even amoral at times, Newman was not afraid to be despicable.  While only Oscar nominated for this film, ironically he won roughly 25 years later for reprising Eddie for \"The Color of Money.\"  Laurie, Scott, and Gleason all picked up Oscar nods as well.  The film is impeccably acted and beautifully filmed.  Not just for those with an interest in pool, \"The Hustler\" is a searing drama that stands as a deft character study of a man figuring out what is important after all.    While the Collector's Edition seems to be handsomely packaged as a two disc set, whether or not it's worth the upgrade from the Special Edition seems a bit suspect.  Both have widescreen presentation, commentary from Newman and \"Time\" film critic Richard Schickel (among others), and features on \"How to Make The Shot\" and \"The Hustler: The Inside Story.\"  This new addition adds four featurettes--\"Life in the Fast Lane: Fast Eddie Felson and The Search for Greatness,\" \"Milestones in Cinema History: The Making of The Hustler,\" \"Swimming with Sharks: The Art of the Hustle,\" and \"Paul Newman: Hollywood's Cool Hand.\"  So it's a judgment call whether or not you feel these extra shorts will add to your viewing experience.  If you don't own the film, then it's a no-brainer!  Either way, \"The Hustler\" is a true classic.  One of Newman's best (if not best) performances make this gritty and timeless drama a must own DVD.  KGHarris, 04/07",

Well, it's Hell on Earth for all of us mere mortals as Aion with a bewitched Rosette wanders the world healing people and driving mankind into enforcing justice, even if they have to murder those they find guilty of sin! The Magdalene Order is strangely relegated to the sidelines in the old \"God doesn't interfere with Man, so He lets the Devil do it!\" cliche. The whole thing becomes some sado-masochistic dream in which characters are dying left and right but don't worry, we're being tested like Job fatalism. Chrono and Azmaria desperately try to track down Rosette as Satella is locked in a battle with her older sister, whose memory was wiped by Aion.     Sad to say but Volume 7 of Chrono Crusade brings a series that started with a lot of laughter and entertainment to an end filled with sadness and overacting drama. Maybe to a Japanese audience this theme of making Man to suffer as a test is something new, but to Christians, it's all old hat. The humor from the first couple of Volumes is also sorely missed with this gloom and doom installment. And another sore point is Azmaria's singing which is supposed to be divine, but just sounds like poorly pronounced English by a Japanese singer. The saddest facet of this show is that it never was allowed to achieve its potential.",

Danila was not a bad guy, though he did fit into the criminal world well. He still did what he could for those who had nothing. It was, at times, hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man.     The movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two Danilas.

            "input": "One of the Best Criterion releases yet. . In this 5 disc set, the five Antoine Doinel films are released. All are by Fran√ßois Truffaut.     The first film, \"The 400 Blows\" or \"Le Quatre Cents Coups\" was previouslly released by the Criterion Collection but was taken out of print until this version was released. Truffaut based it loosely on his own troubled adolescence. It follows 14 year old Antoine Doinel's youth playing hooky from school, later running away from home and eventually sent to a juvenile deliquent center.     The second film \"Antoine and Collette\" or \"\"Antoine et Colette\" was originally a segment of a film titled \"L'Amour √† vingt ans\" or \"Love at Twenty\" It follows his life as he is in his late teens working in a phonograph record factory.     The third film, \"Stolen Kisses\" or \"Baisers vol√©s\" covers his dishonorable discharge from the army, his reunion with his girlfriend, and subsequent attempts to find a steady job     The fourth film, \"Bed & Board\" or \"Domicile conjugal\" skips ahead to after he is married. It covers his wife's pregnancy, his son's birth, and an adulterous affair he has with a Japanese woman.     The fifth and final film, \"Love on the Run\" or \"L'Amour en fuite\" covers the process of his divorce and reunion with an ex flame.     The films wer made between 1959 and 1979 and Jean-Pierre L√©aud reprises his role for each film. The films are very impressive and quite rare for there to be series like this. Each film has some fine secenes and some interesting comedy. The acting is good and many scenes are well photographed.     The box set has some excellent special features also.   out of the five discs, four are numbered. For describing the special features, I will list the unnumbered disc as the last one.    Disc one contains the first two films. 400 Blows and Antoine & Colette. The supplements for the 400 Blows are similar to ones in the out of print version. There are two audio commentaries. One is by film professor, Brian Stonehill and the other is by Robert Lachenay who was a lifelong friend of Fran√ßois Truffaut. The commentary by Lachenay is in French with subtitles. There is also audition footage for three of the child actors in the film. Jean-Pierre L√©aud who played Antoine, Patrick Auffay, who played Rene, and Richard Kanayan who played Abbou. There is also footage of Jean-Pierre at the Cannes film festival for the screening of the film and a theatrical trailer. There are also two television interviews with Fran√ßois Truffaut about the making of the film.    It also contains the short film, Antoine and Colette.       Disc two contains the film Stolen Kisses along with the following special features:    There is News footage of Truffaut's participation in the sucessful attempt to shut down the 1968 Canne Film Festival to support students and striking workers, a TV spot of Truffaut and Jean-Luc Goddard showing ther support for Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise founder, Henri Langlois at a time when his job was in jeopardy, news footage of French cinema VIP's protesting against the planned removal of Henri Langlois from his job, excerpts from a TV interview with Truffaut discussing actor Jean-Pierre L√©aud's portrayal of Antoine, and a video introduction to the film and events surrounding its release presented by film historian Serge Toubiana.    Disc three contains the film Bed and Board with the following supplements:    Behind the scenes footage with interviews of some of the cast & crew, a TV interview with Jean-Pierre talking about the film being the last in the series (before Truffaut decided to make the fifth and final film,) a TV interview with Truffaut and Bernard Revon discussing how the write the scripts, and a scene from a Truffaut documentary where he discusses the character of Antoine Doinel.    Disc four contains the final film in the series Love on the Run along with the following    Truffaut and Marie-France Pisier talking about their work on the film and their feelings about the film, Scenes of a TV interview with Truffaut talking about his feelings on ending the series, There is also a theatrical trailer.    The final unnumbered disc contains:    Fran√ßois Truffaut's 1957 short film, \"Les Mistons\" or \"The Mischief Makers\" about some young teenage boys who attempt to sabotage the relationship of an older couple. The film also has oprional audio commentary by Claude De Givray. It is in French with English subtitles. There is also a primer for the film presented by Serge Toubiana, a noted film historian.    There is also a 44 minute interview with co-writers Claude deGivray and Bernard Revon. A scene from a 1961 documentary titled \"Fran√ßois Truffaut,\" a 1981 TV interview with Truffaut, and a slide show of movie posters for the four feature length Doinel films.    This set is a must buy for those who like the series as well as Criterion collectors, and fans of Fran√ßois Truffaut's work",

This is Michael (LAST OF THE MOHICANS, HEAT, THE INSIDER) Mann's far superior, first film adaptation of Thomas Harris' RED DRAGON. It's superb. Creepy, tense, edgy, slick when you don't expect to be, and genuinely even-handed about the story's anti-hero Will Graham and the supposed monster Francis Dolarhyde (portrayed as no less a human than the cops who pursue him), MANHUNTER is a artfully crafted thriller that stands apart from the other \"Hannibal the Cannibal\" films. I also far prefer Brian Cox as Lektor, he gets under your skin without making an incision, while Anthony Hopkins splattered the screen with patent medecine ookiness.    That said.... I was very disappointed when I rented this particular set. The second, \"director's cut\" version is clearly a pre-release work print, with lower grade titles and dubbing, and a final scene of Graham visiting near-victim family #3 that is just terrible.     The first disc is the release version, and though it restores a few scenes which were snipped from the VHS cut, a quick line from the scene in which Graham figures out how Dolarhyde is picking his victims is \"missing.\" (\"As a child my heart bleeds for him ... as an adult ... slaughters whole families for selfish, trivial ends. ... Are you uncomfortable with this kind of understanding?\") Whether it really needs to be in the scene is arguable. Mann may've removed it from the final version for good reasons. He sneers at his friend and former colleague, Crawford. Alienates him. It's a false climax in a scene when the REAL climax is the storeroom guard (on the phone) confirming Graham's breakthrough discovery about the mountain of forensic evidence.     Other than that, the first disc is superbly transferred. If you've only seen this on tape, the clarity and color saturation of the original film will amaze you. Save your pennies, buy the \"release version\" single disc release, and let Canal/Anchor Bay learn that mis-labled \"director's cuts\" just won't sell.",

There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.    Branford Marsalis comments about Sting's music:  The music is a tremendous social statement.  Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say \"This s$!t is out.\"    Bring on the Night is a movie about the launching of The Dream of the Blue Turtles album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\" is a response to his earlier \"Every Breath You Take\".    Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.   In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, \"I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think.\"   Good protest songs are made to be sung.    One world is enough for all of us.  Love is the seventh wave.  I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.      Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.    This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.  If you are a fan of acapella or minimal accompaniment, watch the film to hear the amazing, open versions of both Roxanne and Message in a Bottle.

I have been waiting a long time for this film to be on DVD, but to find that they are insulting Robert Ryan again by providing poor quality DVDs of many of his films now on DVD. Most recent example in Billy Budd, which I also have been waiting to be on DVD for eons. Both The Naked Spur and Billy Budd should have been given first class treatment. Naked is only marginally superious to the VHS due to the soft picture (Mann's other Westerns have been transferred better). MY VHS copy of Billy Budd is superior to the DVD. I definitely won't buy the DVD. Another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of Billy Budd were deleted in order to fit it on the DVD. I wonder which scenes they were.   As for The Naked Spur, it is another Ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality. It is amazing how an actor such as Ryan can interpret malevolence so well, yet be a peace activist in real life. When Ryan's Ben Vandergroat cooly murders Jesse Tate, his deep seated cold bloodedness, which has only been talked about up to that point in the film, occurs at the moment when Ben kills Jesse. Ryan's final line to Janet Leigh as he lays in ambush for James Stewart and Ralph Meeker encapsulates his situation:  \"Pretty soon Roy and your friend Howie are gonna show up. Then I'll get me some more insurance against dying young.",

Though based on the famous character in Phil Silver's famous oldie TV show, the new \"Sergeant Bilko\" is less an homage to that show than it is to the classic Steve Martin of his 1970's days. Though this Bilko (again a shifty and tireless grafter, the evil face of non-coms everywhere) is very much the opportunist that Silvers' character was (he runs the base casino), as shy of risk as Silvers was (the unit's mobilization orders for Desert Storm mysteriously disappeared) and manages to get caught in his own dealings as Silvers had (Bilko botches the fixing of an Army boxing match, unwittingly tricking each boxer to think he's the one who's supposed to take a fall) the screwball zaniness is very much out of Steve Martin's SNL days.     The script has Bilko's unit charged with testing a brand new army weapon - a \"hovertank\" that is soon to be cancelled because, among other things, it simply doesn't work. That the hovertank's end will spell doom for his own cozy position doesn't seem to bother Bilko, mostly because he lives day-to-day. Things change when the officer charged with evaluating the hovertank turns out to be the fearsome Major Thorn (Phil Hartman).  Years earlier, Bilko unwittingly made an enemy of Thorn by accidentally implicating him in one of his bitched schemes. Now a major, Thorne isn't simply content enough to eliminate the Hovertank, but must now axe Bilko as well. They say that desperate times reveal the man, and Bilko is now revealed to be the spineless weasel his troops have come to love. Martin plays Bilko like a character from one of his old SNL skits. It's sort of fun to watch the guy work on material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen (\"LA Story\", \"Roxanne\") and more mature dramatic roles (\"The Spanish Prisoner\", \"Grand Canyon\" and that update of \"Silas Marner\"). It's light and breezy and you'll probably forget most of the gags, and the script under-uses most of the supporting cast (especially the now late-great Phil Hartman as Bilko's evil nemesis), but it's still fun",

This second sequel to \"Darkman\" maintains the visual style of the first two, has great music, a few good action moments, and a very good performance from Arnold Vosloo as the hero. These are the four things I liked most about \"Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die,\" which isn't a bad movie, but it's not very good either. I'm not only a fan of Darkman, I'm also a fan of Sam Raimi, Liam Neeson, and Arnold Vosloo. Given this, I was sad to see Raimi and Neeson leave the franchise, but am thankful for Vosloo's performance. He does a great Darkman/Westlake and the sequels, especially this movie, have him to thank. While the second was a great follow-up, this film is a little on the stupid side. Jeff Fahey, overacting in every scene, plays bad guy Peter Rooker, who is a drug dealer who is after Darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him. The plot digs deeper into Rooker's life and soon Darkman is disguising himself as Rooker and befriends his wife and daughter. Darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family, that he is only after Peter. But soon Darkman's light side gets the better of him. The movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners. Thankfully, director Bradford May keeps a dark, violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself. There are a few unintentionally funny moments, more so than in the second, and this hurts the movie a little. I suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two. I did, and gladly added this one to my collection. I have no regrets about it, but take fair warning: only fans will enjoy this one. Everyone else will be in the dark",

The film is decent enough to merit 3 stars, but I'm deducting one because of the dreadful DVD.      What's so bad about it?    I'm truly annoyed by DVDs that keep viewers as a CAPTIVE AUDIENCE, forcing them to sit through production credits or FBI warnings, unable to fast forward.  It's an insulting time waster for the audience.  But CARLITA'S SECRET takes it to new levels.  The DVD opens with about a minute of production credits and FBI Warnings, followed by a 5 1/2 minute promo short that one is FORCED to watch.  No fast foward allowed, nor does the Menu button work.  Altogether, over 6 minutes of crap that one must sit through before the film.    Then after the film is over, before you can go back to the Menu, you have to sit through the same 5 1/2 promo short YET AGAIN.    Hey Maverick Entertainment, there's a REASON DVD players come with fast forward and Menu buttons.  It's so that WE THE VIEWER can decide what portion of a DVD that we PAID FOR we choose to watch, WHEN we choose to watch it.  Instead, every time I want to watch this film, I have to sit through your promo crap.    Shame on Maverick Entertainment for stealing the viewer's time like this.    If you get this film, you may want to pop it in the DVD player well before you plan to watch the movie.

This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD.      Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in \"The worst Pies in London\" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street      Carol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational \"Before the Parade Passes By\" from Hello, Dolly!      Yul Brynner performing \"Shall We Dance?\" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress!      John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-\"Hey There\" from The Pajama Game      Paul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in \"Kids\" from Bye Bye Birdie      Joel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song \"Willkommen\". This song never gets out of your head!      Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: \"All That Jazz\" and \"Nowadays\". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment.      Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song \"Lullaby of Broadway\" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street.      Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform \"Tomorrow\" and \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws.      Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-\"Jellicle Songs\" and the classic \"Memory\". It is stunning to watch.      Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- \"Buenos Aires\" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron.      Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song  \"Applause\" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of \"hits home\" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals.      All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!",

As much as I can't stand Tori Spelling's \"acting\", she's the only performer not phoning it in. (Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots?)  What little life there is in this movie, it owes it to her.    The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking.  The \"sizzling\" dancer looked like bored monkey. And the soft, sensitive Gabriel has no personality. Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery.  I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy (which wouldn't be too much of an effort for him), there wouldn't be much of a movie.    A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat.

Sure there are other movies that have butchered their source material beyond recognition, but it's not even the butchering that's the problem. The problem comes when the director hits all the marks and completely misses the point of the book. Jan de Bont decided to take the atmospheric Haunting of Hill House and turn it into a carnival ride and give an easy explanation to the haunting. DePalma went and decided to tone down the racism in Bonfire of the Vanities. But those weird decisions to miss the point pale in comparison to Shlessinger's choice of turning a vicious novel into sentimental slop.    From the opening sequence with the tinkling piano music to the ending with Faye sighing at Tod's stupid rose, this movie sets out to jerk tears and make the viewer feel bad. Even if there wasn't a great book to be killing, this would be a terrible movie. But with Day of the Locust as a source material, the awfulness of this movie borders on the criminal. One imagines the book done right by a Quentin Tarantino or a Todd Solondz.    Where the book is fast, the movie is slow. Tod Hackett is supposed to be a fat cynical observer but Shlessinger decided to cast an anonymous pretty boy in his role. The casting choice is decidedly better with Donald Sutherland as Homer Simpson, but Sutherland is emoting way too much pain for the humor to come through. Every time you see him you want to kill yourself and his abuse at the hands of Faye goes on forever.    The riot scene that ends the movie becomes a Night of the Living Dead ripoff and the whole thing just drags on. Furthermore, the key sequence of the book (Tod imitating the police sirens) gets lost and Tod just cries and gnashes his teeth or something.    This is a terrible movie.

Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.

This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.

Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.   Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.   The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.   Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential \"Stonewall\" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.   For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.   It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.   Admirers of \"Stonewall\" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with \"Stonewall\" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.   His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.   It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.      In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb.   I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition.   It was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with Stonewall.",

While there is enough gore to certainly warrant horror flick categorization, director Chi-Leung Law delivers a very old school Hitchcock suspense tale.  Close-ups on objects like a foot dragging across the floor leaving a bloodstained trail heighten the suspense and move the story.  Angelica Lee as Fung Chi-Ching, a girl who needs a new kidney and has inhibitions that keep her from fully embracing her boyfriend, does a good job and hits many levels from hysteria to jealousy to drunken delirium.  Andy Hui who plays her boyfriend, Dr. Tsui Wai-man, hits a number of levels also from the guy in love to the man whose hormones outpace his common sense.  As researcher Suen Ling, Karena Lam projects a person who has had a difficult upbringing and as frequently as not walks on the shady side of the street.  The twists of plot that trace a kidney thief who black-markets organs for $60,000 a pop never leaves you quite settled until the final frame.  Subtitled with Chinese dialog the often sparsely verbal picture translates well to an international audience.  \"Koma\" turns out to be a pleasant, often intelligent, surprise.  Enjoy!",

            "input": "The Fog of War -- We're In It Again . Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War.  It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands.  While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them.    The experiences he recounts - most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam - are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations.  Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler.       MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions.  It's also a very valuable instructive tool - recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam.  It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him.  It is therefore filled with omissions and lies - the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq.        Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 & 11.  In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in what was formerly Persia are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject.  (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get).       1. Empathize with your enemy.     2. Rationality will not save us.     3. There's something beyond one's self.     4. Maximize efficiency.     5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war.     6. Get the data.     7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong.     8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning.     9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.    10. Never say never.    11. You can't change human nature.    What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration.  That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson.      Fog of War is an excellent film.  In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters.  Pure evil does exist.  It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal.",

Imagine a cartoon series that teaches your kids respect of elders, doing homework, saying your prayers at night, bite-sized science lessons, respecting other cultures and people while at the same time actually killing the bad guys instead of worrying about offending them.    Welcome to Johnny Quest - A journey into TestosteroneLand where men are men, boys are boys, bad guys get killed and women are nowhere to be found.    This cartoon series is about as conservative as a cartoon can be.  You will NOT see this box sitting on the movie shelf at your liberal friend's house.  For example, attacking crocodiles get repelled with gunfire, bad guys get shot (dead), the key scientist has morals (and prefers to be armed), and ex-military bodyguards protect the kiddies by using bullwhips to crack scorpions into pieces.  Also, Dr. Beton Quest is prone to tell the boys to pray when science eventually fails to come to the rescue.    Jetpacks, hovercraft, jets, monsters, ray guns, scientific experiments, military action (tanks vs robots), bad guys, soldiers and police (being portrayed accurately in a positive light!), prehistoric beasts, cavemen, Natzi war criminals getting punished, etc.    Imagine the government only relying on REAL scientists who examine things through actual experiments and resulting data - not politicians pushing junk science like global warming, totally ignoring the millions of metric tons of greenhouse gasses and solid particulates volcanoes release and how it was warm enough for the Vikings to grow crops in Greenland 1,000 years ago.    I would have paid hundreds of dollars for this DVD set.    PS:  You might be interested to know that the title of this product is mispeading, as there was never a second season of Johnny Quest, and thus, there will be no additional DVD sets of the original Johnny Quest - this is all there is.  The original 1st-season 26 shows on this DVD set were actually stretched out over two seasons when it aired in 1964-65.  These 26 episodes are all that were ever made.  The show was also hugely successful, but the production costs (this kind cartoon-making was unprecidented at the time) killed the series.    Race Bannon for President",

I thought that Damon Wayans delivered a knockout performance as the loud-mouthed, gold-toothed, trash talking, squeaky voiced Major Benson Winifred Payne. He was so funny that I nearly had a heart attack while laughing at the same time.    After a major drug bust goes extremely well in South America, Major Payne (Damon Wayans) returns to Parris Island, South Carolina and finds out that the U.S. Marine Corps is throwing him out of the military back into civilian life. After two weeks of civilian life, Payne is let back into the military under one condition: go to Virginia and train a group of delinquents for an ROTC program at Madison Academy. Payne regretfully accepts the job and puts each of the boys into 8 weeks of living hell! It becomes a fight because the boys do what they can to put Major Payne out of their lives!    I have so many favorites scene through out this movie but the one that shines the brightest is when Wayans had a dance sequence at a club where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice \"robot\"), and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. Many of the gags are side-splitting funny, and the vocal tones and mannerisms of Major Payne are just spot-on hilarious. And the kids in the film do a remarkable job in their supporting roles. The kids in fact steal the show (especially the younger ones). Lots of absurdity in the movie, but still here and there peeks through a poignant maturity on the deeper symbolism of what boot camp is all about    Of course, it is a feel good movie so you know everything will work out in the end. Base on some of the lower reviews you can see that this movie is not for everyone, but at the same time is worth seeing. If you don't like it by the time Payne does his \"Failure to communicate!\" line then maybe it isn't for you. As for me it's utterly brilliant.",

But the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday, or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets.    From the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality, Scorsese tries to make an Elia Kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years --monomaniacal mumbling, zero charisma; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy.    Who was Jake La Motta? Why was he this way? What was his background? What did he hope to achieve? On the Criterion Laserdisc of this film, La Motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than Scorsese and Schrader's drama does in over two hours. To me, that's BAD filmaking.    I have heard from film snobs that much of Raging Bull's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of Scorsese. He had just failed miserably with New York, New York and this was almost a religious purging of his soul. I suppose if you want to read into it, be my guest. I consider that self-absorption. I have also heard the patronizing \"it's funny\" angle regarding LaMotta. I do not think this was Scorsese's intention and I do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny",

Further, at the end of World War 1 the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist and the British controlled the former Ottoman Capital of Istanbul.  They conducted a witch hunt, they arrested 144 Ottoman Officials of the leadership including the then eqivulant to the prime minister and conveyed them to their island colony of Malta.  After two and a half years of exhuastive inquiries they could not find any evidence whatsoever to charge any of them let alone convict.  All 144 Ottoman Officials were released and allowed to return home.  Further the investigator Lord Curzon (well known for his hatred of Turks) asked the US Government of the day to provide any evidence they may have had in their possession.  An answer came back that the US did not have any evidence with which to use against the Ottoman leadership.

But he was absolutely brilliant at clever, witty thrillers, one of the earliest of which is \"The Lady Vanishes.\" While it has some major plot holes, Hitchcock makes up for those with witty dialogue and solid acting.    Iris (Margaret Lockwood) is having a last girl's-night-out with her best friends, at a small Alpine hotel. As she's leaving on the train, she befriends a kindly little old governess (Dame May Whitty) -- who vanishes while Iris is napping. Even worse, everyone denies that the old lady existed, making Iris wonder if she imagined the whole thing.      She enlists the help of eccentric musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) to help her find the old lady, once they are both convinced that the lady existed. Now the pair must go through the train in search of the old lady -- but they never expected to uncover an international conspiracy, which could leave them all dead.    \"The Lady Vanishes\" was a pretty early movie of Hitchcock's, and at the end we're left wondering about several oddities in the plot (how is an eighty-year-old lady so athletic? How inept can those foreign agents BE?). As a spy thriller it's flawed but passable... but it's very good as a comedic mystery.     Hitchcock takes his time introducing us to these characters, by having them all bunk at one overcrowded hotel. One particularly funny scene has Gilbert invading Iris's suite, after she has him ejected from his room, and strewing his things all over as she orders him to leave. But Hitchcock also captures the claustrophobic feeling of being menaced on a train.    As well as the feisty socialite and weird musician, the movie is sprinkled with cricket-obsessed Brits, ebullient hoteliers, and bickering adulterous lovers. They all do fairly solid jobs, with Redgrave as a charming, slightly odd standout. And they all get some entertaining dialogue, no matter how stodgy they are. (\"My father always taught me, never desert a lady in trouble. He even carried that as far as marrying Mother.\")    You'd expect Criterion to do the best job with this film. But in terms of quality for your money, I found that the Diamond Entertainment version is pretty good. The picture is fairly clear, neither too light nor too dark, and the soundtrack is clean except for a slight crackle in the opening credits. Not too bad for a mere four dollars.    \"The Lady Vanishes\" is a comedic mystery that doesn't quite work as a spy thriller. But it's still an entertaining, taut little movie. Definitely a keeper",

Yup, not to marginalize the other people who made the show great, but that's basically what it boils down to.  When I saw none of these people in the opening credits, I was concerned.  The people who did make this movie, however, confirmed my fears by making an extremely mediocre film, if not just plain sucky.  I mean seriously, this wouldn't even have passed as an interesting episode of the tv show, let a lone a film.      In one of the extras, the director or someone says that he just wanted to make a \"fun\" film and that they finished the script in no time at all.  Guess what, it shows.  That is except for the fun part, but the lack of thought and vision part is definitely apparent.  The plot is extremely cliched and stupid.  Maybe if any of the 3 girls were interesting at all, it would've been passable.  However, we ended up with an extremely annoying, rebeling daddy's girl who looks like a Hale Berry clone, a Renee Montoya clone, and some girl tied down to a jailed boyfriend.  Yeah, why should I give a crap about any of these chicks?  In the extras they said they didn't want to do something definitive with Batwoman, but I call it laziness and lack of effort.  If Batwoman's secret identity was one good character it might have worked, but instead we get three worthless ones.      I was at least expecting some lesbian subtext to make things somewhat interesting after I heard the idea to bring Batwoman back as a character in the comic was sparked by this movie.  However, any subtext in this film was extremely minimal if even existent.  I did like the fact that they continued the Barbara/Bruce text, but it was only in one short scene.  I guess having Batgirl and Batwoman in the same movie would be too much for some reason I can't comprehend.    The music to this movie isn't that great as everyone else said, especially compared to Shirley Walker's beyond amazing score.  However, I disagree with everyone who said that the animation was good.  It looked like low-budget, digitally colored, corny crap to me.  Definitely no where even close to the amazing, noir-influced film making from the tv show.  I was also a fan of Penguin's voice in the show, but here he's played by the Mad Hatter's voice actor instead.  I don't know if Penguin's voice acotr died or that he was just busy, but Penguin just wasn't the same this way.      Oever all, I can't find much to like in this film.  I did find the inclusion of fan-service including Batwoman's costume a nice gesture, but definitely not enough to save this film.    So yeah, only get this if you're a completest.  If you're just starting to buy Batman for all means get the tv box-sets instead.  Every episode is much more enjoyable than this half-baked movie",

I'm not very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than Harry Potter. The kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round.     The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but \"Lemony Snicket...\" entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!).     There's a lot of CGI here but not to the point to annoy you, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performance to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzm√Ø¬ø¬Ωn, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Cedric the Entertainer...) in small roles. Sublime film.    It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, and if you like unique plots, highly recommended for all type of audiences!",

            "input": "When things get hot, people get burned ... bet on it! . Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral &quot;I nearly got crushed in the crowd&quot;, and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies &quot; Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy&quot;. This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers",

            "input": "Living proof as to why and how Hollywood often insults the intelligence of today's movie-watchers. . This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it.    Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's \"pet\" squirrel escape his pants to the \"bathroom\" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call \"toilet-bowl humor.\" Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call \"amiable,\" \"heart-warming,\" or even \"cute\"; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe \"artist\" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust.    Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a \"special edition\" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing",

Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More\" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').    But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.     Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clich√©d sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big clich√©?    Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.     We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters.",

I would have to agree, however, with those reviewers who have noted that visually the cartoons in this Vol. 2 of the \"Chronological Donald\" were not restored to the same degree of perfection as those in earlier releases, including Vol. 1 of the \"Chronological Donald\" and the release containing many Donald World War II cartoons entitled \"On the Front Lines\".  There is a clear difference in quality, which is apparent when the Donald cartoons previously released in \"On the Front Lines\" and repeated in this collection are compared to the cartoons that are new here.

One hopes that in Chronological Donald Vol 3 (apparently not to be released in 2006, but perhaps in 2007) there will be a return to the quality of Vol. 1 and \"On the Front Lines.\"  One might even hope for a new, improved Vol. 2, but that is probably not in the cards",

The word in question is \"Adversario\", and Simon decides to play along; but this leads to a series of attacks starting with the release of Sarin, a poisonous gas, inside a church.     Simon decides to start investigating and searching for the source of the attacks, and that is how he meets Maria, the journalist that is in charge of the investigation for the newspaper. From then on, things get really interesting, when more attacks are noticed, and Simon and Maria get involved in the action. Also, Simon's roommate (Toad) starts acting weird and has some suspicious items in his possession, leading to a certain level of paranoia in Simon. Whether this is justified or not, only time can tell.    An interesting script and reasonably good performances make this an enjoyable movie. If you like to discover new places, the impeccable sights of the city of Seville will give the movie and added flare. For those of you that are used to American thrillers, this film may provide a break from the norm. If you have read authors like Perez-Reverte, you know what I mean, since in the Spanish tradition, you do not always find the extremely twisted plots or the consistent happy endings you see in American films. Whether you will get these elements in this movie or not is for you to find out.",

Okay, ignoring the obvious fact that Pyun made this... \"film\"... out of the scum that stuck to his shoes after walking through the cutting rooms of 3 or 4 other really crappy movies - all involving... cityscapes and leather, I'd guess... Where was I... Oh yeah. And leaving aside the question of whether any of these actors has every really been good (I love them all, you understand, but I also \"like\" Starbucks coffee when Kona isn't available - ie all the time except payday)... Um, I feel that what sums this hunk of celery up is that the bad guys \"hide\" a huge bomb on the roof of the San Francisco city hall, and then have a bunch of henchboobs \"guard\" it so's Hopper and Pressly can get out of range.    Now, let's recognize that city halls don't tower over every other building in any city on earth (this is reserved for the buildings of banks, insurance companies and general commercial piracy outfits). Which means authorities would be able to see the spear carriers guarding the bomb and act accordingly. This you could see in any bad movie. Perhaps not in the light of the feeling that some of the guards might wonder who would be guarding the bomb while it was their turn to get out of range, though. And how, really, do you sneak a bomb the size of an elephant onto the roof of a city hall. Even pre 9/11 my imagination failed.    But here's where I had to look under the bottom of the disc's case to see if somehow, something had fallen out of it. Can I really believe Ice-T would play a man stupid enough to attempt to take this roof by force? No ladies and gents, a bad movie can be the most fun you'll ever have with your clothes on, but this Ticker goes too far, crosses a line (trips over it actually), and stumbled into chaos.

            "input": "Excellent yet realistically frightening. . This story of a Jewish woman in search of her father (separated from him as a child in 1927 Russia), in a time when the world was on the verge of war, is heartbreaking and very real. It is low key but I was riveted. You can feel the underlying tension of knowing, and the subtle buildup of the inevitable invasion of Paris. It chilled me to the bone in one part to hear the sounds of the Germans marching into the city. The movie, considered a sleeper, shows the frightening reality of what it was like to be there at that time in our history and potentially in danger if you were Jewish, a gypsy, homosexual, etc. The acting was superb. John Turturro (Dante), brilliantly plays an Italian arrogant, selfish, self-centered, manipulative opera singer who tries with no success to ingratiate himself romantically into Suzie's life (Christina Ricci, the heroine of the film). Her performance was also excellent. The look on her face throughout the film shows her haunted, yet with a quiet strength in her determination to eventually reconnect with her father. Her rejection of Dante causes her friend and Dante's ex-lover Lola (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett who's Russian accent was excellent) to leave Paris and go to America because her life was in danger. In the interim Suzie has fallen for Cesar, a gypsy horseman played by Johnny Depp, yet another excellent performance. Some people are comparing this gypsy role with the one he played in Chocolat. There is no similarity except for him being softspoken and unassuming. Definitely not a \"character reprisal\". Not Depp's style. The only character he's reprising is his pirate, Jack Sparrow which by now the whole world is aware of.   The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending. The second it ended, it was like I was thrown into shock. Not one for abrupt endings unless the film warrants it. This one did not. But don't let it stop you from seeing this movie. Really holds your attention. I'm so glad I bought it.",

            "input": "NOT JUST BAD BAD FOR YOU! So Sugary sweet it makes you sick to your stomach. . On the surface Maid In Manhattan it seems like a light romantic comedy with a predictable and sweet love story. However the numerous racist and sexist stereotypes throughout the undertones of this Cinderella tale will make any viewer of color extremely bitter. Better have a couple of barf bags around while watching this movie. You're gonna need them.    Jennifer Lopez is a maid in a four-star downtown Manhattan hotel. (Stereotype #1 about Latinas) She dreams of becoming a hotel manager (Stereotype #2 about Latinas- all work in service jobs). A single mother (Stereotype #3) she struggles to work during the day and take care of her 10-year-old son and is supported by her mother (Stereotype#4) who works in a rundown Spanish restaurant uptown (Stereotype#5) While cleaning the room of a rich British woman, she decides to try on some of her clothes. Conveniently, a rich senate candidate comes to the room and mistakes her for the Hotel guest. He's smitten by her charm and her looks. She's attracted to his loot. So to bag the rich guy she and her friends (also minority stereotypes) go along with the ruse and more supposedly humorous hijinks ensue. The flimsy story disappears and the movie slowly changes from a vehichle for Jennifer Lopez, Actress into a vanity project for J. Lo, Superstar. We get numerous shots of her walking around the city in designer clothes, Eating at fancy restaurants and trying too hard to look hot while courting a bored Senate candidate. The movie comes to a climax when the ruse is revealed. She and her friends at the hotel are fired and her dreams of becoming a Hotel Manager are crushed.    But wait-Prince Charming(tm) is riding down in his white limo to save her. He's had such a wonderful time with her that he's fallen in love(tm). He tries to talk to her in the street, but she gives him some spiel about not knowing who she was when she was a maid and now caring about her. This leads to him seeking her out at her new job. While she's working at another hotel, where he's conveniently he's holding a press conference, he finds her and professes undying love for her. They kiss and we get a montage of pictures showing them living happily ever set to J.Lo's painful butchering of Diana Ross' classic \"I'm Coming out.\" She's married to the senator, getting the management job at the hotel and then one of her saying they're still married a year later. Excuse me I have to go puke. (I also have to reorder the barf bags; no telling when I'm going to need them for the next romantic comedy)    Words can't describe how much I hate this movie. It's an insult to women and minorities. Maid in Manhattan insidiously hides numerous racist and sexist messages under a beautiful front of pretty actors, lavish locations and luxury goods. The movie secretly tells women of color they can't find success without those essentials for success: expensive designer clothes, perfect make-up, beautiful hair and a rich White man to save them. Worse, it tells women to lie and manipulate to get what they want. Because we all know working hard takes way too much time from shopping. Movies like this aren't bad; they're bad for you. Watch too many movies like these and you'll get your mind warped.    It seems like the producers were trying to make a \"Pretty Woman\" type movie for J.Lo but they didn't understand the execution of J.F. Lawton's brilliant concept. In an attempt to copy Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan tries to update the fairy tale by just using minority characters in most of the roles and fails miserably. There was a lot more under the surface of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts vehichle than most people understand. Pretty Woman wasn't an update of a fairytale it was a satire poking fun at the fairy tale. Lawton was making fun of all the fairy tale stereotypes by using L.A's downtrodden as the characters in the story. He was making the comment that to get to happily ever after both the man and the woman have to learn to value each other as equals.    The acting here is horrible. No, scratch that it's WRETCHED. Jennifer Lopez is terrible. Terrible singing, terrible acting and she didn't look too hot in all those designer clothes either. She has no chemistry with Ralph Finnes and adds no dimension whatsoever to her character. Throughout the movie she's just J.Lo superstar playing dress up. After seeing this movie and Enough I can tell you Jennifer Lopez's acting career is in serious trouble. She's gone from an actress who showed tremendous potential Selena, Out of Sight, and Anaconda to an egotistical over-the-top ham with no presence and no personality. Ralph Finnes is horribly miscast in the role of the Senate candidate. I couldn't believe he was from New York with that British accent that kept popping up in every scene. An actor of his caliber deserves better than this syrupy slop. Bob Hoskins must need some rent money because a fine actor like him deserves better than this. Natasha Richardson and Amy Sedaris chew on scenery while waiting for their paychecks to clear. Tyler Posey (Parker Posey's son) is the only actor to give a good performance here. I'd love to see more of him in the future.    Please, Please IF YOU VALUE YOUR DAUGHTER'S SELF-ESTEEM DO NOT LET THEM WATCH THIS MOVIE! Get them the Wonderful Bend it Like Beckham, Akeelah and The Bee, and Disney's Mulan. The older crowds can Get Muriel's Wedding, J.F. Lawton's Pretty Woman or his hilarious Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.",

Allen's willingness to risk, whether he fails or not, should be a clear invitation to consider this piece if just for the purpose of contrasting his present work with earlier films that defined him as a professional funny man.     The discerning viewer might enjoy this character study about six people if he or she wants a piece that demands a bit more reflection. As other reviewers wisely point out, Allen borrows from Chekov, particularly Uncle Vanya, in September and shows us how selfishness and thoughtlessness have their repercussions on innocent bystanders.     But the plot unfolds carefully as Lane (Mia Farrow) struggles to deal with unrequited love for a struggling writer (Sam Waterston)and an unwelcome guest in her mother (Elaine Stritch). I tend to favor the scenes which take place in candlelight. Lane's best friend, Stephanie, (Dianne Wiest) plays the piano as various characters reveal their fears and desires in carefully constructed monologues and dialogues. We learn a great deal about how professional concerns do not always eclipse the existential questions people face or the reality that people can go on living while harboring painful regrets.     Eventually, a particular truth surfaces which sends the characters reeling but Allen gives us a reprieve by offering an ending that is fair albeit unnerving.     Allen fans who enjoy his comdies should switch gears to view this film. Like his more sober films, September offers viewers the pleasure of character development as the fuel which moves the film forward.",

For a film in the action genre, it consists of ALL bad elements.  The plot actually had potential, except the dialog is on the level of a bad High School film.  Segal is so over-weight that you can tell he's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences.  Unless he can lose weight and get into shape, this is the last film of his I'll spend any time watching.    Unfortunately, the sets, the action, the dialog, the acting, the directing, and so forth, are all between the D+ to C levels of quality.    I'd rather have seen a corny Kung Fu movie. At least there would have been some excuse for so many bad elements in one film.    Avoid this film totally",

            "input": "Great Samurai movie with roots in American detective fiction . Yojimbo (The Bodyguard) is a samurai movie based in the detective novels of Dashiell Hammett - particularly Red Harvest. Akira Kurosawa wanted to bring the best of literature and interpret it into Japanese cinema. Its interesting that the two main influences in this process were Hammett's hard-boiled detective fiction and William Shakespeare (Ran, Throne of Blood). The always-excellent Toshiro Mifune plays the nameless title character who schemes and plots of take down an entire town of gamblers and gansters. I won't recap the story, suffice to say that his plans lead into several battles and some beautifully choreographed sword fights. Yojimbo was later made (nearly scene-for-scene) into A Fistfull of Dollars by Sergio Leone with Clint Eastwood as \"The Man with No Name.\" Bruce Willis brought the character back to it's ganster/detective roots with the not-so-good \"Last Man Standing.\" Yojimbo is awash with cinematic violence, but the charm infused into the movie by the cynical, yet obstinately principled, hero surprised me when I first saw it. The performances of the supporting cast, as usual with Kurosawa's films, add depth and wit to each scene. For what its worth, Yojimbo has gradually become one of my favorite movies.     If you end up enjoying Yojimbo, check out The Seven Samurai, Sword of Doom, Miller's Crossing, The Maltese Falcon, and The Thin Man.      Criterion did an excellent job with their recent re-release of Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and they gave the same treatment to both Yojimbo & Sanjuro. A new (and improved) translation, commentary from Steven Price, as well as documentary film focusing on Kurosawa during the time he was making these great movies.  This review is modified from my review of the Yojimbo/Sanjuro double DVD pack, each movie is great, but I'd recommend picking up both",

The \"avant-garde\" style of the film has been done better by other filmmakers (specifically Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger, and Harmony Korine), and the film is mostly about Jonathan, not about his mother. The critics made this film sound like it was an attempt by Jonathan to bring him closer to his mother, to try and understand her by making a film about her, and to bring \"closure\" to their relationship. Well, the film isn't really about Jonathan's mother, it's strictly about him. We hear and see tons of information (with annoying title cards) about Jonathan's life, career, and loves. It feels like an episode of \"this is Jonathan's life\", as if Jonathan is this absolutely fascinating, brilliant individual that we must all pay attention to. He may become a great artist someday, but he isn't there yet. Jonathan uses his mother merely as an excuse to make a very self-indulgent, narcissitic film about himself. He doesn't really seem interested in her, other than as an excuse to show how much HE'S suffered, not really about her suffering. While Jonathan had a horrendous childhood, I felt very little sympathy towards him, as he is constantly mugging for the camera in a \"feel sorry for me, I'm gay and my mother is insane\" way. The man has been taping himself since he was in grammar school, so he's just a tad in love with himself, methinks. Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy is a film that deals with a schizophernic, and it is much more interesting and artistic than this film (Korine's uncle is a schizophernic). Derek Jarman shot his films in multiple formats similar to this film, like 35mm, 16mm, video, and super8, and weaved the images into an artistic and fascinating tapestry. Kenneth Anger, as well as Jarman, infused a gay sensibility into their films, which Jonathan doesn't do very well. Overall, disappointing, considering critics said it was absolutely brilliant....",

Although it looks the same as the HG Wells story and the 1960 movie, this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing. Alexander's motivation for building the Time Machine is entirely different, and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind (that is, if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes).    So the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the George Pal version. We don't even find out anything about what we are about to see!    But things get worse is in the distant future. Although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the Eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete. Instead of unknowing sheep, they are new-agey world-culture pluralists. The dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense. And there is no Rod Taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts.    The only reason why I give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years, and I found some of the special FX (the moon) and Jeremy Irons, cheesy as they may have been, fun",

Best of all, the Flash appears on and off throughout the episode.  This is quite a change from those cheesy super hero television series of the 1970s where we were limited to a glimpse of our hero only twice during the show:  Once during the first 20 minutes and again in the final five minutes.    THE FLASH was a natural extension of Warner Brothers' success with the BATMAN motion picture.  In fact, THE FLASH shared many of Tim Burton film's elements:  A darker superhero, most of the stories taking place at night, and Danny Elfman music.  Comic book loyalists were quick to point out the deviations from print, but given the choice it was better to have THE FLASH for one reason than not at all.    CBS premiered THE FLASH during the 1990 - 1991 television season. As numerous reviewers have reiterated, the show was doomed to fail because of CBS programming mismanagement.  The early 1990s was a time when ABC, CBS, and NBC still held most of the cards as \"The Networks.\"  As Networks they crowded their programming line up with series, sitcoms, mini-series, sporting events, and specials.  THE FLASH was often displaced from its time slot so often that fans could not keep up with it.  At times it also aired at the same time as other popular shows such as THE SIMPSONS and THE COSBY SHOW.  Contributing to the show's demise was that the first Gulf War, DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, was constantly in the news and a regular source for special news reports.    The show should have been awarded a second season, but CBS had zero tolerance for low ratings.  A couple years later THE FLASH probably would have found better success on FOX or CW.  Alas, it was not to be.    Thus it was that I was surprised by the show when it appeared on the British satellite station Sky One in 1992.  At that time Sky One was also beamed to continental Europe and provided an additional, and sorely needed, English language television channel for US military personnel in Germany.  Unfortunately I was not able to catch the whole series.  By the time we added a satellite dish to our German apartment balcony THE FLASH was only a couple episodes away from finishing its run on Sky One.  A couple years later I stumbled on two video cassettes of the series, the pilot episode and a \"movie\" assembled from two episodes involving The Trickster, and was able to enjoy a little more of the series.    The DVD set is very affordable.  If your remember the series from 1990, now is your time to order the DVDs and enjoy them at your liesur",

It is just amazing what they can do now to \"clean up\" the sound so the scratches and static on older VHS/DVD formats are gone and it sounds just like it did in the theatre.  I was also extremely impressed with the re-colorization they did to bring back the green in Viven Leigh's eyes -- she really did have the Scarlett O'Hara eyes -- that was lost in the older versions.    The story is uplifting and sad at the same time.  It was a time in the South that is often forgotten.  It is also a story that you can't place in the context of today's world or it would seem silly or racist or violent.  However, Margaret Mitchell, the author of the book it is based on, DID romanticize the South a lot so you do have to take the storyline and so forth with a least a pound of salt!!

The film opens up by saying it's based on true events, so you wonder is it based on Sean Reid's young life trying to pursue acting.  To me this film was pointless.  It's named Redemption, redemption from what?  It shows Christian, played by Brian White,  going through depressive pshycotic episodes trying to find his way in life. The only scenes I liked were between him and his father.  The conversations between them were very meaningful with Christian trying to get through to his father, which lets you in on his family history, and his father trying to help his son cope with life.  Christian is battling many demons; his father not being a good example in his life, his mother not being there, his struggle to pursue acting, and trying to find love.  This all leads to Christian making poor decisions.  He starts partying and getting in stupid fights.  He starts to take a turn for the worse when he meets this actor who can get him a gig and starts using marijuana.  One of his friends, the guy who plays Marlon, acts like a total jerk and disrepects women and his girlfriend puts up with it.  It was ridiculous.  Melique, another one of Christian's friends stops hanging with them when he sees that they are starting to make wrong decisions.  Realizing this, Christian finds Melique.  Melique tries to redeem Christian from himself by having a serious heart to heart talk with him.  You would think that since the movie is named \"Redemption\" that Christian at this point would turn his life around.  He does find hope again and wants to start a new life with his girlfriend (Claire).  It doesn't last long when Trent (a foe of his) spots him and beats him up.  Then the downward spiral begins again.  Christian starts getting high and starts having hallucinations.  He has a mental breakdown and starts doing strange things.  He think he sees Trent and goes out in a rage with a knife in his hand running around town half naked.  When the police officers can't get through to him he gets shot.

He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another \"sick\" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).  It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: \"Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it.\" That's the moral of the story, really.   \"Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?\" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day",

Episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting, but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral. None of the characters are likable or interesting after that point.     The story line was leaden. After growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3, Cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force...except it takes *FAR* too many episodes to reveal this. Much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long, boring, circular talks between Cordelia and Connor (yawn). In the words of Buffy: \"Alright! I get it - You're evil!\" The blah blah Oedipal/Modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating. Would that Cordelia had never come back for season 4, because it's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found.    Connor and the Cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named Jasmine...who is kind of like a cross between LaFawnda from Napoleon Dynamite and a New Age yoga instructor. A full five episodes are filled with long, dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain. Connor's character doesn't develop...period. Sorry folks, but he doesn't get gone until the final scene of the final episode. In a word, blah.     Some good stuff: The gang releases Angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal, of course. It's well-played by Boreanaz and highly entertaining (Oh, and Angel's hair is slightly shorter and darker, which is a nice change). Faith returns for a few episodes, the best of which is Orpheus. Faith and Angelus share flashbacks of Angel's good deeds (\"Dude, you just saved a puppy!\"), while guest star Willow works to restore Angel's soul and give guidance to floundering Wesley.",

Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined.  The father is being played for a fool.  This dysfunctional family seems doomed.  Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection.  Is she capable of handling this responsibility?  Will matters finally get out of control?  \"Rain\" is morally bankrupt.

I can't vouch for the quality of the picture or sound of this particular DVD, just the storyline. I really enjoyed it. A lot of action, but there is (obviously) a philosophical undertone to the whole film.     Purists will probably dislike that the philosophy (and much of the original story) of Isaac Asimov's book takes a backseat to the action. During some scenes, I was thinking: wow, they definitely made a video game about this movie. Much of the latter half of the movie is mind-numbing special effects/action, though, contrary to another viewer's opinion, I didn't find the climax \"stupid.\" I found it complimented the philosophical aspects of the film, though it probably could have been developed more fully with a little more dialogue and a little less action.     Parts of the movie actually reminded me of arguments put forward by Peter Singer, the radical secularist/ professor at Princeton University who advocates infanticide for disabled children. Specifically, this conversation from the film sticks in my mind:    \"You are making a mistake. Do you not see the logic of my plan?\" To which the reply comes: \"Yes. But it just seems too...heartless.\" Essentially, the robots used absolutely no heart in the decision making process; just cold, detached logic, which sometimes sounds great on paper, but is much less appealing in the real world.    In sum, a lot of action, though the philosophical aspect is still very much present (man vs. creator, creator vs. man, the soul, purpose in life,  free will, natural law, conscience and consciousness etc) once you reflect on the film. Mostly action entertainment, but also thought provoking on further review",

The premise: Hollywood uses a computer program to create and mold the biggest female star ever.    It's pretty obvious (and has always been) that Britney has very little musical talent, but they molded her into the biggest music icon in 2000. On this DVD you get a chance to relive her early greatness in videos like \"Sometimes\", \"Baby one more time\", \"Oops I did it again\". Those were such wonderful videos (directed by Nigel Dick). Britney looked so beautiful and happy. It's very shocking to see what that happy little girl became today. Nobody would have thought that this squeeqy clean girl would be prancing around hollywood with no panties, on drugs, and shaving her head bald. These video's are not only entertaining, but they are also a window into the Britney transformation. The video \"Lucky\" from her oops album in particular is strange, because Britney really became the Lucky girl (lost in an image, with nobody there to wake her up). By the 3rd album, you can see Britney smiling less, becoming more sexually deviant, and singing \"Im a slave for you\". Her last album has shocking video's such as \"Everytime\", where Britney dies in the bathtub (from what looks like suicide). Sure, she pops out of the tub at the end to let us know she is okay, but it's still very strange. Also contained on this DVD is Britney's unfinished video \"Outrageous\" (from her 4th album). Britney is totally out of her element in this video, pretending to be a home-girl in the ghetto. She jumps on snoop dog (the rapper) and licks his face like catwomen (from batman 2). That was quite possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.     Well, Britney just got out of rehab, and I hope she will be okay. People on the internet are already betting who will father her next child. Aside from what you believe about Britney's lack of talent, she is a human. That's right, she isn't Simone. She is a human, and makes mistakes just like anyone else. She tried to entertain us. The least we can do is give her some sympathy and hope she finds her way.",

You know the tendency for even many great comedies to somehow \"require\" a villian sub-plot? Well 'Innerspace' not only falls victim to that, but the \"on the chase from the bad guy\" scenario propels the film. I guess you could call it \"adventure\", but there's nothing interesting or exciting about it. Short does what he can here and there, but most of it feels like made-for-TV filler material... honestly.     I don't know... Dante is a creative genius, but this is his most lacking IMO. Sure, this is one flick that has brilliant special effects and doesn't ever overplay them, but you almost wish they'd had, because at least something interesting would be happening. 'Gremlins' and 'The 'burbs' had awesomely unique concepts but, by and large, maintained a degree of freshness around them for their running time; 'Innerspace' can't survive for any real length of time.     The concept of the film is great, no doubt, and the actual execution of the fundamental mental/physical relationship between Short and Quaid is pulled off with valor... which is strange, because it's the superficial aspects of the film that fall on their face.

It's been said before (and over and over in all the reviews here, so I won't bore you with the details why it's been said) but I'll say it again:  \"Roadhouse\" is a great bad movie!  I do find it funny that this one has earned that type of fond recollection by so many and turned into a cult hit of sorts because of it; while there are literally tons of these type of movies that littered the action/adventure landscape throughout the 80s and early 90s.  Hardly any of them are even remembered much less revered to the extent \"Roadhouse\" is.  I guess it's just one of those things.  Maybe its because the movie has (at the time) bigger stars, a bigger budget and a larger abundance of gratuitous T&A than most theatrically released action flicks that bare a general resemblance to it (of course, you could find plenty of this type of thing lining the walls of your local Blockbuster, but even though they supply the action and nudity, they don't often supply the big stars and big budgets).  Maybe it was just a matter of right place, right time, right amount of exposure, etc.    Who knows; but whatever the reason, I'm glad enough this film has endured.      This special edition does its legacy as a winking-joke-unto-itself proud (Swayze's character is known as \"the best bouncer in the business.\"  Where was the annual bouncer convention of  '89 held and how is the winner of that title determined?).  The best reason to pick this up instead of the previous, bare-bones DVD transfer is the commentary tracks.  The first is by the film's director, Rowdy Herrington, which is actually rather informative considering the source material being examined.  But the real treat is the other commentary track by director and professional fanboy Kevin Smith and his production partner Scott Mossier.  Not only is it a great commentary, but the very idea that the producers of this DVD saw it appropriate to include a commentary from someone who has nothing to do with making this movie shows that all involved are in on the joke.  They should have just gone the full nine and held contest to find the ultimate, die hard \"Roadhouse\" fan and let him/her do the commentary.  And I'd be willing to bet, somewhere, Quentin Tarrentino is pissed he didn't get a call (he loves contributing his two cents to cult films that he has nothing to do with other than being  either a huge fan or hating the movie's guts - either way, always an entertaining commentator).      Now if only studio execs would get off their butts and release perhaps the only junk-action movie more loved and clamored for than this one:  \"Stone Cold.\"  (It feels like that is the only movie ever made that has not made it to DVD, yet everyone seems to want it to be released, so what gives?!  Since when aren't studios egger to cash in???)  Give us a \"Stone Cold\" special edition and slap it in a two-pack with this classic and you'll have all the craptacular entertainment this side of the old school Steven Seagal flicks you'll ever need.",

Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole \"We're married and my husband's a doctor.\" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and \"Dr. Holmes\" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?    What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.    Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?    Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us \"don't do it!\" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!    It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run.

Yes, there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way, but not in the way of real cinematography (very crude camera blocking) or production design (the hospital set is awful and as for the rest, they're ok but too few). And it's just too badly written. There's some bad acting too, but that doesn't really hurt this kind of movies.   The second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven, but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets, makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them, which gets tiresome pretty quick and also doesn't allow for really fluid plot development. Also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking. This could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they're creating and it ends up a mess.

On second thought, given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of \"shoot the mutants\", it's pretty clear that Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment.  As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of √Ø¬ø¬Ωber-soldiers lead by their \"Sarge\" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of \"The Sphere\".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (√Ø¬ø¬Ωber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).

            "input": "An ironic anachronism, replete with Hollywood PC shibboleths . You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of \"Islam is a religion of peace,\" repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism.       A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up.     After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the \"President wants to appear presidential.\" Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a \"fascist U.S. Army general\", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all).    Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them!     But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for \"violating the Constitution\" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the \"fascist\" general. Ta-dah!    So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists.    Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first.

When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool.     I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book",

This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.    \"My Life as a Dog\" known in Sweden as \"Mitt Liv Som Hund\" is inarguably Hallstr√∂m's best known foreign language film. Though he has done other films they are American or British made. \"Chocolat,\" \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\" and \"Something to Talk About.\" He is also very well known for directing the music videos for the world famous Swedish pop group, ABBA.    The film is about a 12 year old boy in 1950's Sweden. He is very rambunctious and when his mother falls ill, his antics prevent her from recovering, so he is sent to live with his uncle. He meets new people there and makes friends with the towspeople. He often compares his misfortunes with those worse off than he is.    The film has some excelent scenes of the more rural areas Sweden and some fine photography also. It remains a very popular film to this day and has recieved or been nominated for many awards. It won a golden globe for best foreign film and was nominated for best director by the AMPAS. Though it is described by many people as a family film, it got a PG-13 rating in the US. Mainly for nudity and sexual diaglogue. There is a half second of full frontal female nudity, though non-sexual, it still may be a cause for parental concern. The other scene involves material that I feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents are urged to watch the film themselves before letting their children see it.    The special features on the Criterion DVD include Lasse Hallstr√∂m's first film, \"Ska vi g√• hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt?\" which translates to, \"Shall We Go to My Place or Your Place or Each Go Home Alone?\" This film has some explicit sex scenes and definately not appropriate for children.    There is also a theatrical trailer and an interview with Lasse Hallstr√∂m. The liner notes also include a special notation about the film by Kurt Vonnegut.    Fans of Swedish cinema will enjoy this release",

            "input": "Welcome Back To Horrible Hall! . The episodes always began in the same fashion: On a stormy night, a disembodied voice welcomes us to an obviously haunted yet strangely colorful castle called Horrible Hall.  A vampire bat flies across a full moon and attempts to enter a window, which inexplicably moves, causing the bat to crash into the stone wall, revert to vampire form, and fall to the ground.  The vampire looks at the viewer and gripes, \"This place is driving me BATTY!\"    The vampire, of course, was Count Drac, one of the hosts of Filmation's GROOVIE GOOLIES, a 1970's favorite which is the latest new release under BCI's Ink & Paint brand.  This cartoon, a spin-off of the then-popular THE ARCHIE SHOW and originally paired with the adventures of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH, is a long-awaited release that has finally come to DVD in a package featuring the complete series on 3 discs.    An exponent of the classic Universal Monsters craze that began in the 1960's (and was still going strong in the '70's), GROOVIE GOOLIES was a gang of friendly, rock-and-roll-playing monsters whose adventures acted as a sort of monsterized kids' version of ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN, following almost the same format right down to the wall of windows (here christened \"Weird Window Time\") where the characters told jokes and one-liners.  In addition to Drac, the other Goolies were Frankie (the friendly, sweetly goofy Frankenstein's Monster), Wolfie (a hip, surfing, hot-rod-driving, practical-joking Werewolf), Mummy, Boneapart (a skeleton who fell apart as often as not), the sexy Vampira-inspired Bella LaGhostley, wacky witch-cook Hagatha, and a host of others.  Sabrina makes appearances as well, along with some of the other characters from her show (which deserves its own release as a companion to this set, as the Goolies originated on SABRINA).  The pacing of each episode is frenetic, which helps with some of the humor; many of the jokes are enormously corny, but the delivery and speed with which they are told makes them funny, and the character voices are top-notch talent, featuring Howard Morris and Larry Storch doing most of the characters.    Each episode also featured fun, cute and funky soft-rock songs that were usually somehow related to the show (two per episode), and the Goolies actually scored a Top Ten hit during the '70's with \"Chick-A-Boom,\" which is also here.  The episodes have been well restored, with vibrant color, and the artwork, which Filmation has usually excelled at, really stands out.    Extras include commentary for two episodes, featuring Lou Schemier (head of Filmation during its run),historian Darrel McNeil, monster expert Bob Burns and GOOLIES head writer Jack Mendelsohn, hosted by voice-over artist Wally Wingert.  Wingert also appears as one of the stars of a \"docu-comedy\" called GOOLIANS, which combines documentary material with a sitcom format.  In this feature (which runs almost like a GOOLIES episode) Wingert and fellow Goolian Daniel Roebuck (of LOST), both self-confessed monster freaks, are sent on a mission to gather information about the Groovie Goolies to cure their classic monster fixation.  From my point of view, there isn't anything wrong with a classic monster fixation, but along the way we hear from Mendelsohn, Schemier, Alice Cooper (who originated the monsters/rock music connection), Ron Chaney (grandson of Lon Jr.), Forrest J. Ackerman (ex-FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND publisher) and more, so maybe it's a good thing.    If you're looking for a way to introduce your kids to the idea that sometimes scary can be fun, grab this set; it's a great Halloween treat and a wonderful return visit from some old fiends.  To quote Frankie, \"We NEEDED that!",

The Firemen's Ball is one of a handful of Czech films that defined the &quot;New Wave&quot; era, and had a profound influence on filmmakers and critics around the world.

But Firemen's Ball is a personal favorite, probably due to the fact that I lived in the Czech Republic for five years, and attended similar village balls.  The characters in this wicked satire are portrayed with humor, affection and above all a level of realism that remains unsurpassed.  In the end, Forman does what he does best -- he leaves you torn between laughter and tears.

Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by \"Jaws 4- The Revenge,\" in being worse. \"III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more \"made for TV,\" as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, \"Yeah, right!\", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning \"Officer and a Gentleman\" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of \"Jaws.",

As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.

It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.    He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.    The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.    The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying \"What the hell is going on?\"  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.

The 25th anniversary special on this DVD lasts 2.5 hours, which sounds like a long time, but it's not long enough to do justice to the talent that appeared on the shows over such a long period of time. As uneven as the show was from week to week and year to year, there was still a lot of great material--far too much to cover in this format in any satisfying way. As a result, the clips that are shown are soundbites of soundbites--often, just enough to cover a famous quote (\"wild an crazy guys,\" etc.) with a touch of lead-in. This may be enough to evoke a smile of nostalgia from someone who's seen the skits, but that's about it. When the skits were originally aired, they usually went on too long, but here the DVD's producers err by going way too far in the opposite direction. I'm not sure how you could do a worthwhile retrospective of 25 years worth of programming that would fit on one DVD, but if it can't be done... maybe one shouldn't do it.     The DVD comes with three \"extras\": an interview of Lorne Michaels by Tim Russert, which is mildly interesting; the \"day-after\" coverage of the 25th anniversary show by a heinous TV show I never heard of, \"Access Hollywood\"; and promotional TV coverage by some other NBC news show, which featured clips that mostly overlapped with the special included on the DVD. Again I ask: Why put this material on a DVD? The so-called extras bring nothing to an already lackluster party.    All in all, disappointing.     By the way, for those who care, the Beastie Boys don't actually perform a number on the DVD. They play a couple of measures of one of their own songs before getting interrupted by Elvis Costello, and then they end up playing back-up for him",

Albeit in an angular, toothy kind of wait, which, don't get me wrong, is just fine.     2) Bridget Fonda plays Maggie, who, with some Pantera-lovin' buds break into a pharmacy to get a little Better Living Through Pharmacology, unleash a little jihad on the owner, and get themselves into a firefight.     Everybody gets riddled with bullets, except Maggie, who, in the wretched bowels of withdrawal and all-twitchy-like, greases a cop.     3) Note: did I mention that \"Point of No Return\" is a big-studio remake of Luc Besson's utterly insane, bump-n-grind brutal, deliciously bleak and nihilistic \"Nikita\"? I did not? Shoot me. No, no, put down that Steyr sniper rifle, I'm kidding there Cowboy, sheesh...    4) With that in mind, all you need to know is this: studio director John Badham (who directed, ummm, the cinematic marvels \"Bird on a Wire\" and \"Short Circuit\", which proves he's a real, er, edgy dude) churned out what amounts to a shot-for-shot remake of \"Nikita\". Only it's like the carbon dioxide remake of \"Nikita\": odorless, colorless, and tasteless.    5)Alright: so Maggie gets hauled into a supermax facility, deep-sixed by the Government, manhandled a little too much by Super-Duper-Secret Agent Bob (Gabriel Byrne, starting his slow slide from sneering, edgy brilliance into avuncular B-movie actor Hell), erased from the Big Book of Life and super-shuttled down a little Orwellian \"memory-hole\", and offered a choice: Society made you, baby. Now we'll give you your Murder 101 Training, and you can be a sanctioned killer.     6) That's about it. It's basically \"Nikita\", without the hip and happening and totally ominous techno-score, without Luc Besson's surreally grim edginess and sublime cinematography, with New Orleans dubbing for Nice (without even the fun of a Hurricane, or a shoot-out at the Superdome, which might have enlivened this turd). It's like \"Nikita\" with all the fun and style and gratuitous killing bled out.     7) That said, Fonda looks good writhing around on a bed in her Hello Kitty panties.     8) Oh, and Harvey Keitel shows up in an Enzo Ferrari, I think, though I was way too liquored up by then to care. Do you care? He's channeling The Terminator by way of a tax accountant, and was way too goofy to live.     9) The original \"Nikita\" showed me something I'd never seen before: an Indonesian diplomat literally getting flushed down a toilet.

There was a big controversy earlier this year with \"The Cary Grant Box Set\" which is a great collection in its own right.  Many people were upset that it included the first release of \"Holiday\" which was new to DVD (unlike the other films in the collection), but no stand alone disc was being offered.  Well, good news.  If all you wanted was \"Holiday\" and you held out, here it comes ten months later.    Now, I've always had a soft spot for \"Holiday.\"  It hasn't achieved quite the classic status as a couple of other Hepburn and Grant pairings--\"The Philadelphia Story\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\"--but I actually think that works to its advantage.  I might get into trouble for this, but I somewhat prefer this to the more antic \"Bringing Up Baby\" (Don't shoot me, I know it's a great film too).     Cary Grant plays a carefree soul that becomes engaged to a millionaire's spoiled, socialite daughter.  He is expected to take life more seriously and responsibly--but that's not necessarily in his master plan.  Grant, as always, is charming--the quips and physicality that were his trademark are used to good effect here.  Katherine Hepburn, as the girl's sister, is obviously a better match for him!  Hepburn uses her rapid fire delivery and plays smart and wry better than anyone else in her era.  Of course, Grant and Hepburn have great chemistry and it's a joy to see these two masters banter.  There's plenty of slapstick, but part of \"Holiday\"'s charm is that it balances this with real romance.  It's funny and sweet.    Any fan of Grant, Hepburn, director George Cukor, classics and/or screwball comedy needs to check this film out.  It'll make you smile.  KGHarris, 10/06",

I am one of the many reviewers who purchased this DVD because everyone favorably compared it with \"Seinfeld,\" and (not being an HBO subscriber) I had never seen it. Personally, I found this show boring, repetitive, and often grating. Well, that's just me. You might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy. Deciding if this DVD is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste.  Buy this DVD if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters (as in \"Married with Children\" or Vicki Lawrence's show \"Mama\").  This is NOT the kind of gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in \"All in the Family.\" As in \"Seinfeld\", you will see adults act in childish, selfish, irresponsible, uncaring ways. Depending on how this is done, it can be VERY funny, but \"Curb\" missed the mark for me. I find self-absorbed New Yorkers (as those portrayed in Seinfeld) to be funny, but self-absorbed Californians (as in \"Curb\") are just pathetic, not even laughable. You might feel differently. Neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in \"Seinfeld\", but almost celebrated in \"Curb.\" The characters in \"Seinfeld\" are roughly half a generation younger than those in \"Curb.\" The Seinfeld characters (who came of age in the \"me\" era of 1980s ) commit a variety of hilarious middle-age gaffes and mis-steps associated with a lack of direction in life.  The older characters in \"Curb,\" on the other hand, offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life. They merely exist. You might find this funny, but I found it depressing",

There is little breakdown of technique.  There is minimal race footage, which is helpful to watch to learn by watching experts.  Parts of the footage seemed recycled - we heard very similar discussions about ski wax in the separate \"tuning\" and \"equipment primer\" sections.  You cannot watch the DVDs straight through as they dump you back into a main menu after you complete a scene.  So you must frequently fiddle with the controls to select scenes to watch.

I am giving this DVD two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son (so far we saw it ones). As much more age appropriate material I would recommend:  Hap Palmer \"Baby songs: ABC,123, colors & shapes\";  Bee Smart Baby- Vocabulary Builder;  Baby Babble - speech enhancing video;  Baby Einstein- Van Gogh (world of colors);  The Wiggles-\"Toot-Toot\"",

I was expecting a bit more from this movie, but I guess if I had really thought about it, anything starring Joan Crawford at this point in her life, and the always rebellious/troubled/angry John Garfield, could not have risen above what the film ended up being. My dislikes:  the music; often way too loud, way too much, very very annoying to me. Had to continually turn down the volume when the film went musical, which was much too often. Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie. They had one of those uncomprehendable romances where seeminly they are deeply in love, yet they don't show it or speak it and you definitely don't feel it.  At the end, Joan was just over the top as a drama queen and by this time I was so fed up with this whole film I just kept saying, \"okay Joan, we know you are going to take your final swim so please just get on with it already so we can be finished with this boring and aggravating movie!\" But no, she had to walk at least 2 miles down the beach in her evening gown and high heels, and weep and weep, and make faces, and clutch her hair in despair, and on and on she went and all the while the loud music is playing out her \"sorrow and pain\"! What a relief when it was  finally over! There are some films that leave me feeling very upset and agitated, and this was definitely one of them. What helped me get over it was to read some of the great reviews here on Amazon...some were so funny because they were so true about the stupidity of this movie that I laughed and laughed! Laughter is indeed a great healer!  I also did not go for the cynical piano player friend and his constant stream of one liners. Cynical humor isn't humor and it isn't funny; it's pathetic and sad. I am sure die hard Joan and John fans will always love this film, but all others should be able to see it for what it really is",

This movie pictured a sizable segment of the U.S. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement Mediterranean family. Many Italians I know  said that it could have been their family. The movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted. I enjoyed the wry humor.     At the beginning I was prepared to hate her father. He was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual. And the women of the family were so cynically manipulative. It did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid. He had only the best in mind for his family, and that included his daughters, and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the United States.    One other detail pleased me; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world. Not only do they learn academic things, they meet wonderful people from other cultures there, fall in love, and marry them.    The photography was wonderful and the acting was superb, especially since  the movie was made on a tight budget.     This is one of the best films I have seen in the past ten years.",

I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.    There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.    The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.    The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.    In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex",

The director, I guess, didn't realize that a lot of people have seen that movie \"The Exorcist\".  (Remember?  With Linda Blair?  Oh yeah!) The scene that was bust-a-gut-laugh-till-you-vomit was when the girl is picked up by her hair--you can actually see a wire or something for a minute--and dangled in the air.  It looked so unbelievably fake that I began to see this more as a comedy than anything else.  Is the entity so mad that it wants to glue the hair of young girls together (maybe a deleted scene has her waking up covered in spitballs).    The ending, however, and what is implied about Sutherland's character is not one bit funny and struck me as unnecessarily morbid; also, the performances and general plotline before can't support an issue as serious as incest or child abuse.  I guess at some point this was so obviously a clunker to everyone in the crew that the decision was made  to throw something really sick into the plotline.  It didn't save the movie.

Jane Fonda plays a call girl with a sensitive pimp and harmless businessmen for clients. She goes to a psychoanalyst on a regular basis to moan about her failed attempts to become an actress/model. All we see of her on the job is having sex with a few passive businessmen who meet up with her in high rise hotels and wait for Fonda to guide them through the act of sex.    Donald Sutherland stars as the world's mopiest detective investigating the disappearance of some offscreen character. Did I mention he is a man of few words?  Most of Sutherland's screen time is spent in mute staring and trying not to react to anything.  When he does say a few lines it is in a mumble that registers no emotion.  His investigation consists of going up to hookers and asking them if they would like to be interviewed by him.      99% of the movie is Sutherland and Fonda wandering around from one setting to another asking extras if they know something. Like a guided tour",

This is not a war movie or a social commentary whatsoever, it's garbage.  I read the book years ago and thought the book was kinda' goofy, but the movie's off-the-chart bad.  If you want to watch a kid have sex with ladies, watch people vomit, watch the seemingly constant need to urinate in glorious color just about everywhere every five minutes, and listen to a kid scream a lot for no apparent reason, then get his father killed, also seemingly for no good reason, this is your movie.  Oh, and let's not forget the decapitated horse head filled with eels - man, coulda' lived without that image all day.  Overall, WORST MOVIE EVER MADE DEALING WITH THE THIRD REICH.

Al Pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way. No one else really talked about Belize played by Jeffrey Wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill (not to mention his amusing depiction of Mr. Lies). Watch his description of Heaven to Al Pacino's character very carefully, the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite. I think Justin Kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with Meryl Streep are great to watch. The production only falls short with Mary Louise Parker's character. She reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying. I wanted a little more passion and bite from her. Another disappointment is the sort of forced ending. Each character is forced to talk directly to the camera and it gets a bit too preachy and self concious of a movie/play. But the fully realized characters are what you should come to see",

The dvd consists of images of items with a nursery rhyme or poem being recited in another language. The amazing thing is that the item shown has no relation to the words being spoken! It might as well be completely random sounds, since anyone who has studied child language acquisition knows that babies learn from making observations of language used in context. While I understand that supposedly this DVD is only intended to 'stimulate' the brain, by six months, a baby's brain has developed specifically to hone in on the sounds presented in his own native language, and to selectively ignore others. The brain continues to prune and forge neural networks in response to sounds from the language spoken in the home, thus the idea that random speech sounds are somehow beneficially stiumlating is invalid. A baby's brain becomes stimulated by the sounds that appear repeatedly in his own language. Habituation and imaging studies have shown this time and time again. Imagine if the baby's brain gave equal attention to any sound--the brain would waste valuable time and resources on information that would not be useful in learning to communicate with his caretakers. We acquire langauge so rapidly because the brain is selective.     Babies depend heavily on repitition, adult modeling, observing cause and effect, and from watching other people's behaviors to learn language. The idea that your child with learn anything from just hearing forgien language sounds out of context is very silly. If you want your child to learn language sounds and words from a language not spoken in the home, try exposing him to another language speaker on a routine basis, or show him programs like Dora or Sesame Street, where there is lots of explicit context to help a baby infer meaning, clear annunciation, and repition.",

But, as shy as he was, he was surely it's most visible and successful creator, who was as well known for his social life of the fabulous 1970's and '80's New York, as for his art. I don't know how interesting this film would be to non-Warhol fans, other than a one - look history lesson. But, to me,  a bored dreamer in upstate New York in the 1970's and '80's, Andy Warhol represented all that was glittering, creative, and exciting, and this film brought back a now gone time. His life did seem like a non-stop 24 hour creative/ social frenzy, but there was much more to him than that. The sickly, ugly duckling who was at the  &quot; beautiful peoples &quot; epi-center, if Andy wasn't there, it just wasn't an event...  it's all here in this film. The underground movies, the  &quot;Superstars&quot;, the Campbell soup cans, The Factory, his 1968 shooting, Studio 54,... He had many detractors,(envy does that), and many accused him of turning art into crass commercialism, but this film also talks about the good son and brother, and the generous mentor to young, then on- the- rise artists like Keith Haring and Jean Michele Basquiat. And the man who attended mass every Sunday, and spent almost all holidays feeding the homeless at Church Of The Heavenly Rest, something he told few about. He died much too young, and unnecessarily, leaving an estate of multi-millions, and the auction of his beloved, hoarded belongings, held by Sothebys, was the media event of the year, bringing in an incredible twenty-six million dollars. For someone who's been accused of being a charlatan, talentless, manipulator..., he was incredibly successful, and according to many, the New York City nightlife and culture  was never the same. Whatever he was, the little nobody who started out with none of the things that make one popular, became one of the twentieth centuries most well known artists and figures. This film is an informative visit to anyone who wants to know his phenomenon, anyone who wants to relive it, or if you just want to get to better know of the unique, talented man, who was no better nor worse than any of us",

Ludicrous coincidences dominate the plot to such an extent that you cannot even expel didainful laughter.

Vivian of course was a major howl, but the rest of the lads were right up there with him.  Roger Ruskin Spear in particular was a major scream.  Rodney Slater was a real oddity as well and Legs Larry was hilarious.  So was Neil.  It was just so amazingly great to come upon this.  Like coming upon a time capsule.  There is quite a bit of the Bonzos throughout these shows.  Unfortunately, most of it is not done live, however it is fascinating to hear a lot of their songs in developmental stages. There is almost an hour and a half of Bonzo material on these disks. There are no chapter stops except for the beginning of each show.  There is no copy guard either, so it is possible to assemble all the Bonzo clips on your own disc. This is what I did using a hard disc DVD recorder.  It all worked out beautifully and made the purchase of these DVD's very much worth it.  As for the comedy bits with all the others on the show, well, there are a few things but it really is truly amazing how much improved things got when the Pythons became the Pythons.

The weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal 'psycho' music all the time.     Duvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That's it!

They call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of Jillian. It seems to work, even if they don't use the standard issue witches broom. There is a sort of happy ending.    Sandra and Nicole are good actresses, but they can't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies I've ever seen. \"Bell, Book, and Candle\" is a funnier film, \"Blair Witch\" is a scarier film.

One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations.  Big deal, this is not interesting.  I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking.  Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady.  Thats it. Why is this interesting?  Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care?

Bruce can do it all and he is'nt slowing down!  Anthology is a must have for Bruce completists.  As far as I can tell, everything is here.  3 concerts, videos and interviews all on 3 DVDs.

MTV does not play the good stuff and niether does anyone else, so if you have'nt seen the videos, this set is for you.  Bruce conveys an intelligence that a lot of metal performers don't exhibit.  He stands above the rest and is certainly an individual muscian that is'nt afraid to try new things. If you're into Maiden and Bruce's solo stuff, you will like this set. Also, Roy Z., Dickinson's producer and guitarist is phenominal.  Adrian Smith is always a joy to watch and all of Bruce's different solo bands spout great musicians.  Bruce is a god",

There are some delightful sequences, e.g., when Kim has to discover how to kiss, her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses, and when she has to have sex, she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all.

If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!    Now, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD.    I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.    Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio.

DVD ONE has Tattoo Millionaire tour live footage (DIVE DIVE DIVE), and Skunkworks Live. The DIVE video is poor quality shots, and the sound is not the greatest.  My favorite is the Skunkworks footage.  That album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden.  It's good to the footage done when it was still fresh, and laugh at Bruce trying to be \"alternative\".     Disc two is just Scream for Me Brazil in yet another package.  Good song set, playing Bruce's best solo work ever (Chemical Wedding Material), but it's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens.  Pretty disapointing disc, could have been left out, made the package cost less, and no one would have missed it.  This keeps this DVD from getting 5 Stars       Disc three is the cool best part of this package.  The promo videos are just nice to have in one spot. The Tyranny of Souls promo video is interesting, and where else are you going to find the Samson footage.  All of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video (like knowing the \"Tatooed Millionaire\" video was directed by the pink floyd \"Learning to Fly\" directory...now the connection is made).  Nice job with the last disc.     Overall, I feel the skunkworks video and the Promo material are the best parts of this collection, and make it worth the 10 dollars I paid for this.  I would suggest to all to try an pay under 20 dollars for this collection, because the bulk of these DVD's is filler on disc two, and I would feel ripped off by it.

I've seen 2/3 of \"The Decalogue\" his ten-hour masterpiece and now I've seen the first film in his three colors trilogy \"Blue.\" I think anyone who sees a film by Kieslowski will have a hard time disputing that he was one of the great directors. He's not credited as being one of the great directors, but he is credited as being a great director. Hopefully, in the years to come, his brilliance will become acknowledged. \"Blue\" is a strange film...It doesn't follow the typical rules of storytelling. It has a plot, but the images it uses play as big a part in telling the story as the plot does. Then there's the music. Rarely has the music been as important to a film as it is to \"Blue.\" Juliette Binoche (who won a French Oscar for Best Actress for this role) plays Julie, a young woman whose husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident. Julie was in the car, but made it out alive. Once she heals up, she finds herself being badgered by friends and composers for her husband's last composition (her husband was a famous composer). The movie's turning point comes when Julie calls an old friend that she knows is in love with her. After they do their thing, she moves into an anonymous little apartment building in the hopes of escaping everyone she knows. She fears being hurt again and decides to have no friends, no acquaintances, and no family. Then, in a Kieslowski-like turn of events, she meets her husband's pregnant mistress. There are a lot of movies about people losing loved ones and trying to deal with it. In Kieslowski's hands, however, this formula seems fresh and new. There's no denying that Kieslowski and his co-writer Krzystof Piesiewicz understood the human condition and humans in general. None of the scenes in the film feel artificial or unneeded. Kieslowski doesn't waste time filling the screen with pointless scenes, but has it shaved down to the essentials. As I said, this film is very different. Unique would sum it up quite good. While I'd be lying if I said I understood the significance of this, there is something he does in the movie that I was quite fond of. In certain scenes, while Julie is talking usually, loud music will begin playing and the screen will fade to black. After a few moments, we fade back into exactly where we were. While I haven't seen the other films in the trilogy quite yet, I'm looking forward to them. Any fan of foreign cinema should see this film...If you haven't yet discovered Kieslowski, you need to.

It was perhaps one of the most enjoyable and captivating films I've ever immersed myself in.     So, hungry for more Evenlyn Waugh (whose books I read in a college course that was based exclusively on his work), I found \"A Handful Of Dust\" at my library and figured I'd give it a try. Since the same author wrote it and the film was made by the same film people as Brideshead I was filled with anticipation.     My wife and I watched the first hour or so one night and while it had some good moments, and was certainly beautifully filmed, we were left cold by it. But we figured maybe after that the movie would develop.      So we decided to continue it the following night. Big mistake!     I only wish I could get back the time I wasted on it. While I don't expect \"Happy endings\" in a film (Brideshead certainly didn't have a \"Happy ending\") the ending in this story left me in disbelief.      Since I didn't read this particular book by Waugh and didn't know its ending, I was completely unprepared when the credits started rolling that the movie ended as it did. I was amazed by the stupidity of all I had just witnessed.      I thought the story would have been much more interesting to see if Tony would \"toughen up\" a little, transform and grow from the circumstances of his \"captivity\" rather than just look like a pathetic fool.      Perhaps the only redeeming aspect of the movie was watching Brenda get what she deserved, still it wasn't enough to justify watching this film.      This film was basically a \"series of unfortunate events\", with myself feeling most unfortunate of all.     My wife to her credit fell asleep during the last part of the film and used the time more wisely than I did.       Compared with a film like Brideshead Revisited, where the characters really developed throughout the story and took on a tremendous amount of depth, This story, was full of one dimensional characters. Dressing these characters up with beautiful costumes and scenery, well written music and excellent cinematography still didn't save the story from being like a bad \"twilight zone\" episode.     If you look up my reviews, you will see that I don't go out of my way to give bad reviews, but I was so annoyed by the time I wasted I felt I need to share this. Of course I have just wasted more time in connection with this film by now writing this review, but I felt maybe I could spare someone else the wasted time.",

I was so enthralled that I acquired Airplane, which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it.    I had thought he could do no wrong, but he really disappointed me here. What is wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING you will see in here are things you have already seen in other Leslie Nielsen comedy movies. There are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it's painful rather than funny. For example, the x-ray glasses. My God, when that was mentioned, I just felt nauseous.    The problem with this movie is that it continues the Naked Gun-variety humor, but it does it rather badly. Most of the humor in this movie is sexual-based and that will eventually get boring. Aside from that, this movie lacks a proper plot. All throughout the movie, it doesn't seem like Dick Steele (Nielsen) did anything, but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag. Nielsen's other movies had bad plots too, but at least they were coherent.    I am sorry (mostly to myself for seeing this), but this was just a bad movie.

I found Imogen attractive in other roles and was curious as to how i would see her.  Well it was amusing to watch the scenes where her cover could have been revealed whether or not she was fooling anyone i could not care cause she still looked fine as a woman to me.  One particular time was when an instructor was correcting her posture during fencing training at the military academy.  Later I enjoyed her swordsmanship in a duel that was surprisingly aggressive so that you would not mind having her around alot enjoying life. There is a relationship between twins that is very poinyant during the beginning and at the end of the film that Imogen had part into that is worth noting",

Instead, \"The Grudge 2\" is a detailed, shimmering example of why people loathe sequels, and how (with rare exceptions like preplanned trilogies) they are pretty much always bad. Overused spooks, lackluster acting and a plotless plotline are only a few of the things wrong with this croaking horror.     Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) learns that her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is seriously ill, and goes to Japan to fetch her -- with horrifying results. Karen's last warning: \"Don't go in that house.\"     Other people aren't doing the same, since a trio of schoolgirls went into the house and are now being haunted by everyone's least favorite croaking ghosts, Kayako and Toshio. And an American family in Chicago is being slowly destroyed by visions of the ghosts, which have somehow transferred out of Japan and into the United States.     Aubrey and a reporter investigate the odd circumstances of Karen's madness and demise, going to the abandoned house that Karen tried to burn down. As the malevolent ghosts close in on them, Aubrey discovers the secret past that has turned Kayako into an evil force that cannot be stopped...     Ghosts, ghosts, everywhere, and not one of them is actually scary. Apparently Takashi Shimizu assumed that the more apparitions you put in a movie, the scarier it becomes. Sadly, it doesn't work that way -- Kayako and Toshio pop up for a cheap care every few minutes, and when they aren't around, OTHER ghosts are popping up for no good reason.     All those ghosts are mainly there to prop up a thin-as-paper storyline, with flaccid dialogue and a few cursory nods to the previous film. The schoolgirl storyline is completely disposable, and the Chicago one is a transparent set up for the inevitable (and dreaded) \"Grudge 3,\" during which the horror rules get recklessly broken. So only a third of the movie has any interesting content -- usually a few minutes of exposition about Kayako.     It's rather sad that Gellar is the ruling force here, and she's only in it for a few minutes total. She's certainly more charismatic than the Tamblyn, who seems to be sleepwalking through her role. Ohga Tanaka and Takako Fuji provide some scares as the ghosts, even misused, but the rest of the cast is simply going through the motions of really tepid acting.     \"Grudge\" had its flaws, but it was a horror masterpiece compared to its disastrously pointless sequel -- it's all about piling as many ghostly appearances as possible into three thin plots.

And the guy dressed in the beast costume, well, I guess they weren't that into special effects back then except for the \"gallons\" of ejaculate they used in the rape scene. Totally stupid! If this was great euro-sex of the 70's, I'll stay away from anything else produced by this guy. The best sex in here was at the beginning with the horses and then the servant getting it from the daughter (who they SHOULD have used in more of the scenes), but then it's all down hill from there.

The cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description, so I thought the DVD contained all new workouts.    The 3 Arms and Abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video, so did me no good.  I didn't buy the DVD for the lower body workouts, but viewed them just to see what they were.  Two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the DVD menu, meaning you select workout 2, for example, and the DVD takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1!

The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out.

Yes, the townspeople have flirted with evil by having three common thugs bullwhip their sheriff to death because he would likely report their mine as located on federal lands and so endanger their ambitions for limitless wealth.  Yet, the movie also appears to see the town, Lago, as worthy of redemption.    After railroading the thugs into prison, the town very conveniently proceeds to pretend that nothing ever happened:  \"These are God fearing people,\" the new sheriff earnestly tells the High Plains Drifter.  However, when the thugs are released from prison, they seek to receive their back wages in the blood of the townspeople who doublecrossed them.      Only when the townspeople experience the same terror that their bullwhipped sheriff must have experienced does the High Plains Drifter reappear to save them from the thugs.  Indeed, at the end of movie, when the High Plains Drifter rides away from town on horseback, a tombstone is erected with the name of the murdered sheriff.    Unlike the outlaws, the townspeople feel a very real sense of collective guilt, which the High Plains Drifter and their ordeal have reawakened.  Perhaps that is the hope of America -- that we do have guilt over our past and we do not just pretend that nothing ever happened.",

Basically we're pulled along it seems to either the wives being robots like the old film says- and then we're told it was just really chips in their brain making them housewives? And somehow the chips disappear in the end and they become their real selves again? Then they make a real huge twist in the end which I guess I shouldn't give away but is just real tacky I think.

To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as √Ø¬ø¬Ω The Old Curiosity Shop √Ø¬ø¬Ω. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome.    Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonn",

I'm only 21 and I have had that day.  George (Kevin Kline) has had one too.  He's a forty-ish architech who's fallen out of touch with his estranged ex-wife and his children, most notably his teenage son.  Whats worse yet is that, upon realizing his failure as a parent, he finds out that he hasn't much time to make it better.  He's been diagnosed with cancer and his time is short.  George decides to get to know his son by building his dream home with him.  George's son (played BRILLIANTLY by newcomer Hayden Christensen, and if you'd seen Chistensen on the TV show Higher Ground then you already knew he could pull this off) is far from thrilled about the quality time he'll be spending with his father and is determined to get out of it, or at least make his father miserable during the process.  What's heartwrenching is that George hasn't told anyone about his condition, but once it's revield you can only imagine the heartache in store for the central charactors, including his ex-wife played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Kevin Kline gives the performance of his career here, as does Christensen who plays the gothic loner prostitute with so much conviction you feel for him every second of this film.  As the movie winds down to its tear jerker of an ending you'll be left wondering if you've done all you could to be the best father/son/mother/wife/husband you could so that when you pass you'll be remembered favorably.

To merely skim the surface:    Why Morvern is touted as a study of progress, liberation, or self-discovery is dificult to see when both the plot and character remain static throughout the film; indeed the initial party scene and lingering final shot seem to echo each other in a way which makes the beautiful cinemotography seem little more than a thoroughly convincing blue screen selected to flash in time with a cautiously hip soundtrack.     Although other indy film goers may crucify the non-believers, this sort of  movie is equally disgusting as the bloated star-powered behemoth that has equally little depth of thought or genuine vision.

The footage from other films that was edited in looks poor. The 2.0 Mono soundtrack is in good shape. There are basic subtitles in French and Spanish, scene selections as well as a beat-up trailer.     CONCERNING THE FILM: (from my website, www.angelfire.com/film/eurowar)    The always-overrated David McCallum is one of the few good things in this low-budget World War II adventure piece, yet another quickie from Oakmont Films.     Sometime prior to D-Day - probably early '44 or '43 - a Mosquito Squadron is sent to bomb a V-1 rocket installation in France, when Squadron Leader Scott (David Buck) is shot down and presumed dead. His second-in-command, Quint Munroe (who just happens to be like a life-long brother to him) has to return to England and tell his beautiful blonde wife (Suzanne Neve) the sad news. As one would expect, Munroe and Mrs. Scott slowly fall in love. But when Munroe is chosen to lead a mission to bomb a new V-3 development center, things will chance quite a bit - because Scott is a prisoner held at the target fortress!     From start to finish, \"Mosquito Squadron\" is a total hack-job - literally. The story is filled with enough contrivances and clich√©s to drive any mildly serious critic mad. Let us take a brief look at a 1964 film entitled \"633 Squadron\". In said film, a squadron commander has a best friend shot down over Norway, and falls in love with his sister. Later on, he is assigned to bomb the fortress where his friend is being held. Sound familiar? And that's not all our title film steals! Virtually all of the aerial battle footage is directly lifted from \"633 Squadron\", while the new footage is comprised almost entirely of horrible-looking miniatures hanging from far-too-visible wires.     The writers have also directly copied another classic war film, \"The Dam Busters\". The feasibility of Munroe's mission revolves around a bouncing bomb, which will skip along the ground and roll into an open tunnel leading to the V-3 rockets. (I won't even mention how convenient it was to leave a big open tunnel to drop a bomb into). The real bouncing bomb (made famous in 1954's \"The Dam Busters\") was designed to skip on water to destroy Nazi dams - not the ground as is seen here! The idea of dropping a bouncing bomb on the ground is, simply, ludicrous and impossible. Introduction of this concept kills the storyline immediately.     The low budget shows up in every action sequence: the French resistance force is comprised of a half-dozen men in berets carrying Sten guns, and only a handful of German guards enforce security at the \"fortress\". The forests are obviously cheaply furnished soundstages, and a face-off with an imitation German \"tank\" is ludicrously shot. We never really see much of the German-held Chateau, and when we do it never looks as though we're inside some high-tech development center a la \"Operation Crossbow\". The scenes set in England fare somewhat better, with some excellent scenes set at airfields and a rather rowdy officer's club.     David McCallum and the cast of little-known English actors do a fair job, even though the no-frills script doesn't give them much to do. McCallum is a fair actor, nowhere near as great as his fans hail him to be, though. He was better suited for television than cinema, and that comes out in every scene. He often looks uncomfortable and awkward, but delivers his often banal dialog convincingly and with conviction. His scenes with Neve are often touching, even though audiences have seen this dozens of times before. There aren't any other actors worth mention among the ensemble, besides perhaps Charles Gray who would go on to play Blofeld in the James Bond film \"Diamonds are Forever\" a few years later.     Oakmont Productions financed a number of cheap British war films in the late 1960s and early 1970s: \"Attack on the Iron Coast\", \"Hell Boats\", \"The Last Escape\" and \"The One Thousand Plane Raid\" among them. These quickies were best suited for TV viewing instead of theatrical release, but United Artists picked them all up and put them on the big screen. Anyone expecting a classic here - or in any of the aforementioned pieces for that matter - is in for a big disappointment. Check out \"633 Squadron\" instead.",

            "input": "Did I ever tell you about the time I invented snowboarding? . Out Cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous \"raunch\" button to be successful.  It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement.  While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold.  Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably.  One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try.  Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and clich√© characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture.  Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise.  That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity.  Why do we, as audience members, do that?  Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor?  While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.    I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed.  I have to get this first one out in the open.  Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film?  The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish.  Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre.  Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like \"This movie is just like Out Cold\".  This makes me so angry.  If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, \"Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca\", instead of the other way around.  Casablanca needs to come first.  With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters.  Were there any?  Great question!  I didn't see any.  Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations.  There were no definitions to anyone.  Sure, one could argue that there were some \"characters\" with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clich√©s, not characters.  Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest.  Nothing of the sort happened here.  Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois.  Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off.  Again, there was nothing of value.  Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.    If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth.  He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers.  He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead.  Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience.  As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter.  The entire \"King of the Mountain\" bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners.  Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain.  The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk.  The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face.  It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.     Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom.  Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public.  I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it.  It is as if most directors are just using the \"cut & paste\" feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring.  Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.  I don't think I could muster the strength to watch it again.    Grade: ** out of ****",

It was I think written by Roger Edens (of Judy Garland fame?), and is a mediocre imitation of Hartesque rhymes, at least in its feverish attempt at multiple rhymes at the start.

Extra lyrics (not by Hart) were added to \"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\" for Durante to sing and Martha's Raye's \"The Circus Is On Parade.\"  Songs from other R&H shows were interpolated.  Did someone high up like god know better than R&H what songs should be in a R&H show?  Finally, and absolutely humiliating for Martha Raye and I suspect Doris Day had a hand in it but maybe not, the line sung by Doris \"Two feet are ever cold\" is followed by Martha Raye with \"Four feet are never cold\" which in turn is followed by an embarrassed flustered \"I only mean to imply\" by Raye.  Goodness.  She said something wrong.  I am beginning to dislike Doris Day intensely.  She disgusts me.  The title of this shocking little song is \"Why Can't I?\" also not from the original show and with much excised.  The story (such as it is) is a predictable drag.  The DVD is cheap on Amazon (until you add postage), it's a flat $20 everywhere else + tax.  If you must, buy it from Amazon.  I wouldn't take it for free.  This is truly wholesome family entertainment, and that's about as nauseous a recommendation as I can give it.  If you like Rodgers and Hart, forget it.  Durante was in the original on stage.  I gave it 2 stars for the pretty tunes (and almost Roger Edens').",

            "input": "A Man For His Times. . I have owned a copy of this film for a long time. I have probably watched it ten times, and I always tear up a little at each viewing. From the beginning newsreel, of a shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed in the footage of his  debate with then California Senator Briggs, a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker, who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears, but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message, nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened, seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated, along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous \"Twinkie Defense\", and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had also been killed, leaned public sympathy  towards White, an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling, historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently, came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are old enough to remember , or are gay.  Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless, lives on.",

            "input": "Jimmy Cagney returns! . The only E. L. Doctorow book I ever read was \"Ragtime,\" and I read it because I enjoyed Milos Foreman's film version. I wasn't impressed with the novel. The author's writing style was excruciating--on purpose or unintentional, I don't know--in a way that reminds one of Theodore Dreiser. Moreover, I continually found myself sighing heavily over the book's anachronisms. Sorry, but the early twentieth century WAS NOT the 1960s! Quit trying to rewrite history! Doctorow did do a few things right, however. His characters, at least a few of them, were interesting. Too, I liked how he integrated their tales with real life historical figures and events. So when I recently learned that Foreman's version of the book came out on DVD, I decided to rewatch the film. The director, who made \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in 1975, went on to lens several other memorable films, including \"Amadeus,\" \"The People vs. Larry Flynt,\" and \"Man on the Moon.\" If you're familiar with any of these movies, it's obvious Milos Foreman likes using his camera to document kooky characters. \"Ragtime\" provides him with plenty of opportunities to examine oddball personalities engaging in often oddball behavior. Those crazy Gilded Age Americans!    Several major and minor stories wend their way through \"Ragtime.\" We follow a well to do New York family--consisting of \"Father\" (James Olson), \"Mother\" (Mary Steenburgen), and Mother's \"Younger Brother\" (Brad Dourif)--that seems to represent the WASP majority. The family becomes embroiled in a pregnancy scandal involving a black woman named Sarah (Debbie Allen) and her lover Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Howard E. Rollins Jr.). While Walker attempts to ingratiate himself with our WASP family in an effort to win over Sarah, he becomes involved in a minor scandal when a group of firemen led by Willie Conklin (Kenneth McMillan) vandalizes his automobile. Other threads focus on a poor Jewish artist named Tateh (Mandy Patinkin), whose invention of a nifty little gimcrack called \"picture books\" leads to a career as one of Hollywood's first film directors. A notorious murder case also takes center stage from time to time. When renowned architect Stanford White (Norman Mailer) starts fooling around with airheaded Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern), her jealous lover Harry K. Thaw (Robert Joy) pops a couple of caps in White's noggin--in full view of hundreds of witnesses. As you can see, \"Ragtime\" covers an enormous amount of material.    Remarkably, the movie works quite well. The first part spends all of its time establishing the story lines and fleshing out the characters. The second part focuses largely on Coalhouse Walker's failures to achieve justice for the wrongs done to him. He eventually turns into a terrorist who, with the help of a few friends, bombs several firehouses around town. Then he seizes a library in New York City, wires it with explosives, and threatens to blow the place sky high if he doesn't receive a new car to replace the damaged vehicle. Let's see--what else happens? Well, Younger Brother strikes up an affair with Evelyn Nesbit only to discover she's a total ditz that flits from man to man in search of easy money. Disenchanted with his failed relationship, Younger Brother falls in with decidedly unwholesome elements that--surprise--play a big part in the film's most important segment. Mother and Father drift apart over a number of issues, not the least of which involves Sarah's baby but also Father's stuffiness when it comes to progressive issues like feminism and race. Booker T. Washington (Moses Gunn) and Harry Houdini (Jeffrey DeMunn) also pop in from time to time, although the former plays a bigger part in the proceedings.    Man, is this a tough film to summarize! Foreman and company pack a ton of stuff in two and a half hours and still fail to incorporate everything Doctorow put in his book. Oh well. Only a television miniseries could hope to achieve a faithful adaptation, and even then it wouldn't work considering the very adult material Doctorow placed in certain segments of his story. I think the best way to view the film is as a well-done period piece populated with a stellar cast. The costumes and the set pieces look great, from the glittery buildings populated by the elites to the dirty tenement houses where Tateh plies his trade. Performances are sublime. Watching Jimmy Cagney play a tough as nails police commissioner is wonderful, especially when you consider he hadn't appeared in a movie since 1961. Donald O'Connor, Pat O'Brien, Jeff Daniels, and even Jack Nicholson turn up as well in smaller roles. The late Kenneth McMillan, a personal favorite of mine, deserves special mention for playing a racist scumbag that you'll love to hate. Throw in an amazing score from none other than Randy Newman, and the result is an extremely entertaining film that holds your attention for 155 minutes.    Extras on the disc include a commentary track with Milos Foreman and producer Michael Houseman, a lengthy deleted scene involving McGovern's character meeting anarchist Emma Goldman, and a featurette on the making of the film. My only real problem with \"Ragtime\" the motion picture concerns the anachronistic attitudes on race. I highly doubt the police would take the word of a black man over a white firefighter back in the 1910s, nor would there be as much sympathy as there is for Sarah's plight. That's the 1960s talking. Anyway, the film is a winner for the reasons I stated above. I also should mention that any movie that shows all around jerk and agitator Norman Mailer taking a bullet in the head gets my vote any day!",

One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.     The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: \"His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving\". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.   There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: \"No man suffers pains of love on the stage.\" For dealing with the infatuated man: \"You have wounded yourself, but not with love.\"     This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.     Well-made period romance films are: \"Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940\", \"Wives & Daughters\", \"North & South\". Fairly made is \"Under the Greenwood Tree\". I rated \"Persuasion\" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however \"Persuasion\" is 5-stars compared to this \"Mansfield Park\". \"Persuasion\" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.",

When I saw so-so actioner 'Belly of the Beast,' I thought Steven Seagal was well on the way to his 'comeback,' finally realizing that authentic-looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom, which is however fading away very fast.  Now I saw this film, and know I was terribly wrong.  His next film 'Out of Reach' is a huge letdown, probably the final nail in the coffin.    Don't get me wrong, I really like his films made in the 90s, like 'Under Siege' action-packed escapism entertainment.  In 'Out of Reach' Steven Seagal plays one Billy Ray Lancing, an ex-agent living in the wilds of Canada, where he finds injured animals and bring them to health.  Yet another embironmentally conscious hero from Seagal, but ... doesn't he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films?     Add to that, Billy Ray exchanges letters with a little girl Irena living in an orphanage in Poland.  When it is reported that she is missing, and a nasty businee of 'human traffic' is suspected, he travels there incognito, secures a help from the local policewoman (while he has no ID), speaks a bit of French, and hits a PC keyboard like a pro, better than a Polish technichian, to restore a secretly recorded image.  We meet a hissable baddie (Matt Schultz), but anyway we are sure Seagal will win, because he has taught the little girl how to decode the 'cyphers' (and check out how she uses it, a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious 'you-gotta-be-kiddin' 0moment).     So, how about the fact-moving kicking and chopping, once Seagal's trademark?  No, these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film.  You just don't have actions in 'Out of Reach.'  As I counted them, well, in the first 40 minutes of 'Out Of Reach' you can see only two action set-pieces: in one, Seagal's hero Billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents (about 30 seconds), and much later Billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car (another 30 seconds).  That's it, that's all.    There are more actions to come, obligatory shoot-outs and sword fights, but not enough to call 'Out of Reach' an action film.  The pace is terribly tedious, the images (when at night) are too dark, and worst of all, not only Seagal but slmost all the Polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story.  Little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger.     Finally, about director Po-Chih Leong (fairly good in Jude Law's brooding thriller with a vampire theme 'The Immortal') who is the least likely choice in Seagal's entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions, and the results turned out as we feared.  The slow-paced story is sleep-inducing, and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best, with poorly-constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal Seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do.",

Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland.  Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written.  By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career.

First of all, this IS NOT a remake of Lee Marvin/John Boorman's Point Blank.

It's about a bunch of escaped convicts who are really bad and blow some stuff up and are at a mall and Mickey Rourke Kills them.  'Nuff said re the plot.    One thing that really sticks out about this film is that Rourke, typically a pretty muscular dude, is positively STEROIDAL!

Three men boldly go to the Sudan with General Kitchener's expedition.  One chickens out and resigns his commission, losing the woman he loves in the process.  To redeem himself, he goes to the Sudan on his own and must help his former comrades.    The story is well-explained, well-paced and has great values of timing, editing, and direction.  The technicolor and the score are both excellent.  4 FEATHERS is a cut above other British productions of the period in terms of technical quality!    FEATHERS also exemplifies the best values of the Victorian UK upper class-- belief in country, honor, loyalty, heroism, and sacrifice.

Watching the 1998 THE SIEGE in 2007 and then rolling through all the reviews of this film from the time of release to the present is a lesson in the power of the cinema.  The obvious initial response was less about the film as a film than about the manner in which the FBI, CIA, Military, Terrorists, and public responded to the unimaginable: shouts of protests about 'glorification of occult terrorists', the Hollywood idea of the impossible happening, and the criticism of the fine cast of actors who steeped into roles 'beyond swallowing' are all here in these reviews.    Now, six years after 9/11 reviewers are taking a different view, though most still find the film pompous and obnoxious.  Offensive versus defensive. And after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the 'war against terrorism' we continue to lose.  Movies that make people think and talk are valuable, and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered.    Yes, there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept, but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Tony Shalhoub, Bruce Willis, Sami Bouajila, Ahmed Ben Larby, Aasif Mandvi among others. And then there are the panoramas of New York City under siege with the Twin Towers standing mightily in the cityscape...  It begs the question: if scriptwriter Lawrence Wright and director Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Glory, Leaving Normal, Legends of the Fall, etc) were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces, why weren't the leaders in Washington, DC in tune with 'absurd possibilities'?  It makes one think - and that is the best thing about this film.  Grady Harp, January 07",

During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.     The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: \"It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.\"    Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two.     If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie.",

            "input": "Top notch transfer for \"Green Mile\" and extras make this worth the double dip . The most important question is simple and straight forward; is this two disc edition of \"The Green Mile\" worth the upgrade? Yes. The three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director. While the previous edition released in 1999 looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition. I suspect the same transfer was probably used and just that the increased space to spread the film over two discs probably helped improve (along with improvements in digital technology)the look of the film.       We get a terrific and informative Commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. Unfortuantely only two deleted scenes have survived as Darabont points out in the commentary in discussion about a scene (and the possibility of creating a \"Director's Cut\")most films have their dalies transferred to hard drive for assemlbing a rough cut and many of the deleted scenes were erased. The two deleted scenes included are interesting but only hint at other scenes lost during the editing process. It used to be that deleted scenes would be tossed into a bin with trims for possible later use not the digital age has made that impossible unless the director saves ALL the trims.    We also get a great 90 minute documentary on the challenges (and fears)that Darabont faced in making another Stephen King project. He was afraid that he would be seen only as a Stephen King director (or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now)which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk.    We also get Tom Hanks make up tests, Michael Duncan Clark's screen tests, the teaser trailer (along with a look at what constitutes a great teaser), original theatrical trailer. We also get the original vintage featurette on the production of the film. I would have liked a commentary from Hanks and the other actors but with so much time having passed and the actors busy schedules it would have been difficult to assemble them for a sit down commentary track (although they could have cobbled together a second audio track with actors interviews discussing the film although I doubt it would as valuable).     Nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $6 extra dollars this is the edition to get. I should point out that many retailers (Costco among them) have this available for $9.00 the same price as the original version is currently selling for making this a terrific bargain.     REVIW OF THE FILM BELOW:   \"The Green Mile\" the third film made by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to Darabont's version of \"Shawkshank\". Based on the five short serial novels (now available as a single novel) published back in 1997. This marvelous follow up film is a terrific but flawed film that sags a bit at the beginning but manages to quickly pick up us its pace. It's not that it isn't involving it is but the third act of the fil is where the film picks up its momentum.     Nominated for four Academy Awards (including Best Picture)this is a rich drama with strong performances all around including a terrific and moving performance from Tom Hanks in the lead. Well worth picking up for fans of King's work but, more importantly, for fans of moving dramas/fantasy films with more than touch of reality.",

            "input": "A wonderful, immensely entertaining film . Too often, Hollywood directors seem to forget that cinematic success comes in the form of great characters.  Doc Hollywood, though, is one of those films that proves the rule.  This movie is chock full of great characters, even in some of the smallest of roles - and it's not just the people, for the small town in which the story takes place is quite a character unto itself.  The town of Grady is sort of an updated version of Mayberry - idyllic, of course, but nonetheless charming and evocative.  It's the kind of place you can only find in the South.    Of course, Dr. Ben Stone (Michael J. Fox) has blinders on when he first arrives.  Having just left the hustle and bustle (and blood) of a large D.C. hospital, he's on his way to La La Land in hopes of snagging a cushy job in the lucrative practice of cosmetic surgery.  On his cross-country drive, he gets as far as South Carolina before fate steps in, leaving Stone temporarily stuck in the small town of Grady with a banged-up sports car and a judge's sentence of thirty-two hours of community medical service.  Grady is in great need of a new doctor to replace the aging Dr. Hogue (Barnard Hughes), and everyone in town (well, almost everyone) - from the mayor (David Ogden Stiers) to the official welcoming committee of ladies and on down to the local farmers - makes no bones about their hopes of enticing him to stay.  Even the glory of the annual squash festival can't do much to equal the scales, though, as California promises fortune and excitement, while a practice in Grady promises only a barely decent salary and quiet, country living.  Predictably, though, Stone finds love - or at least the prospect for love - with the local ambulance driver.  He and Lou (Julie Warner), a single mother and aspiring law student, engage in a lot of mutual flirtation, but she quickly becomes something much more than a mere conquest for Stone, which makes his decision whether to stay in Grady or snatch the gold ring in California much more difficult than he ever would have thought.    With the help of a fantastic cast, Grady quickly begins to feel a lot like home for the viewer.  With just a little interaction here and there, you really come to know a vast number of people - the mayor, the local mechanic, the judge, old Doc Hogue, the implacable Nurse Packer, the illiterate family who depends on the doc to read them the family letters they receive, and the list just goes on.  Two of the faces are particularly recognizable: Woody Harrelson plays Lou's would-be suitor, and Bridget Fonda (whom I have long adored, despite the fact that she's a Fonda) plays the mayor's daughter, a young lady who longs for the bright lights of a big city.  David Ogden Stiers, I have to say, is just wonderful as the mayor; he's the exact antithesis of the Bostonian intellectual he played for so many years on M*A*S*H.  I can't say that all of these actors and actresses sounded all that Southern, but it's not their fault that they weren't lucky enough to be born here in the South.    You might be thinking this sounds like just another story about a city slicker won over by the charms of small-town living.  Doc Hollywood could easily have been just another boring version of an old story, but this film has a special quality that turns it into so much more than a predictable comedy.  Thanks to nuanced directing, rich storytelling, and wonderful acting, more than a few of these characters have a remarkable depth that you pick up on very quickly.  Grady isn't just a town; it's a way of life, with a genuineness you don't often find in any kind of film.  Stone's ultimate decision does not come down to anything as simple as romance vs. money.  Certainly, his feelings for Lou are deep and genuine, but the town of Grady and all of her citizens sing a siren song of love that Stone hears, as well.  As for that ending, it doesn't play out exactly in the manner you might expect, and that's just one more reason to love this wonderful movie",

No shot is ever held for more than 2 or 3 seconds, except between songs.    If you have the CD's you know this is Iron Maiden in their finest live form, but on the DVD you'd never know to look at them, because you can barely see them.     The bonus stuff on disc 3 is pretty good if you're a Maiden diehard like me, but nothing new, really.    All in all, buy the CD, stay away from the DVD, and join me in waiting not-so-patiently for a DVD release of Live After Death, Maiden England and Live at Donington",

I had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything I could hope for (with the exception of them having removed the song \"Home in the Heartland\" which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle).  That night, I ordered not only Riverdance: Live from Geneva, but also Jean Butler's Irish Dance DVD (Which I would recommend).  To make a long story short, don't waste your time with this version of the show.

The original DVD release of \"Howards End\" was the no-frills which probably was fine with everyone who has a tight-budget on DVD collection.  However, after watching this version has totally changed my mind about Criterion DVD editions.  Now, the picture is crisp and sharper compared to the grainy texture of the original transfer.  The scene of Leonard Bast's stroll in the meadows of bluebells was so much more dream-like with the magnificent violet and green colors on the screen.  Also, the music seems to surround all around you compared to the original release which seemed almost like watching on the TV with speakers in your face.  You really have to appreciate that such a film gets the attention for being placed on Criterion release.  Actually, this is released through HVE which is pretty much sister company of Criterion.    Anyways, the film itself is probably the best production of the Merchant-Ivory team.  Its beauty is in its storytelling of the Wilcox and Schlegel families with the best performace from Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.  The supporting cast is equally good with Helena Bonham-Carter and Vanessa Redgrave.  You probably will get the most satisfication from viewing the second disc.  It has several commentaries from James Ivory and Ishmail Merchant.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter tells her hardships with some scenes such as the row boat with the hidden roaring motor and also the rainy return home from a music recital with some trouble from the umbrella.  It was also interesting to listen from the production team about the transformation of London into the Edwardian period with the scenes and clothing/fashion.    Overall, this Criterion DVD edition is worth every penny if you are a fan of filmmaking.  You definitely appreciate the efforts and dedication of Merchant and Ivory to fund and make such a film.  I really can't regret this purchase since many times, films don't get the royal treatment of Criterion.  Oscar-worthy movies are usually quickly released to the masses rather than being tailored for those with higher standards for the DVD viewing experience",

This has always been one of my favorite films, and going back to it as an adult only makes me enjoy and appreciate it all the more.  Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance as Sarah, the main character, whose baby brother is taken by the Goblin King (David Bowie in one of his best characters - who ironically gives an often sensitive and human performance while being fanciful and fantastic at the same time; he wrote and performed all the music, which is also some of his best work).  Sarah must leave her world of make-believe and enter the very real and deceptive Labyrinth to save her brother in time before he's turned into a goblin.  Along the way, we encounter a large cast of Jim Henson's puppet-creatures, some of which become Sarah's friends and helpers in her journey.  The puppets are so believable that you soon forget that they are not real people.  The movie is filled with magic, both on and off screen.    The film is supplemented on this DVD with a \"Making-of\" documentary - an original feature, narrated largely by Jim Henson himself - made during the actual production of the film (released in 1986).  Such a documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into a movie like this and how complex the creatures are - what goes into their creation, how they operate, and how they interact with the sets and other characters (especially in this case with the live actors).  It's a lot of fun to see this \"inside\" look, and more than anything gives a real sense of who Jim Henson was and how much this all really meant to him.  My favorite quote from Jim Henson in this documentary was when he said (about his inspiration and motivation when he makes a movie), \"When I go see a film, when I leave the theater... I like to be happier than I was when when I went in, I like to leave with an up feeling, and I like a picture to have a sense of substance, to be about life and the things that matter to me,\" - a wonderful sentiment to remember in this day and age.    Lighthearted, fun, fantastical, funny, beautiful, exciting, and more \"real\" than many of today's \"realities\" - extremely enjoyable and uplifting.  As an added bonus, Monty Python member Terry Jones wrote the script (and is interviewed in the documentary).  Cheryl McFadden (Star Trek: TNG's Beverly Crusher) also did all the choreography in the film (for both humans and puppets). :-",

But overall, I really loved the message of the film and the originality of it.  This is a film about love, sexuality, and relationships.  It was really beautiful.  Most of what I must praise highest is the acting.  Every single person was casted perfectly for what their unique talents offered.  Corazza's is a VERY believable and truthful actor.  His acting lends himself to innocence and sympathy -- just what Matt needed.  Taylor was brilliant.  She exudes power and assurance.  And she played every one of her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly.  She was perfection.  Allison was surprising convincing and excellent.  I say surprising because for a man dressed in woman's clothing, this is the first movie where I actually LIKED the character and this character was believable and not a stupid stereotype.  Shannon was real person for me.  Boyd was absolutely excellent.  She seems to be the most experienced and a clear veteran of the art.  They were so lucky to get her for this.  She's a world-class actress.      This film was just really enjoyable.  I really found the writer's (Fraser) commentary to be especially interesting.

I don't think it was the nudity Andie objected to, though, or not entirely.  The scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman.  It effectively lets you know what the man's character is really thinking, but it's brutal in a subtle way.  There is also, of course, the (apparent) age difference between the two characters.

In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.      It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and \"The Mummy Returns\" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.      \"The Mummy Returns\" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. \"The Mummy Returns\" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.    FINAL ANALYSIS: \"The Mummy Returns\" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball.     Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. \"Returns\" put an end to that.",

The instructor, Alison Davis, not only cues well to let you know what's coming up, but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique.  The mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and I've found results already.  It's a little over 50 minutes all up, and all you need is two sets of dumbbells.

It's just two bassists swapping ideas. There is no time spent demonstrating any kinds of technique or style, and the accompanying booklet is pretty useless, as it doesn't suggest fingerings, or strings, which is OK for a tune, but pointless for an excercise. The only way you'll learn from this is to go through it frame by frame and hope you'll be able to figure out how he's playing.    Also not so good from terms of performance, Jaco's not at his best here, and has put a fretted neck on his fretless for demonstartion, but it slows him down in the live jam.    All in all, very cool to watch, but don't expect to learn much, or hear much, kind of like watching a VH-1 interview or something of that ilk. Snippets of tunes will get you fired up, but nothing is really explained",

This film has been compared to \"Logan's Run\", \"The Matrix\", and \"Coma\", to name a few, but it most strongly resembles 1979 B movie \"Parts: The Clonus Horror\", probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mock-a-thon \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". Sitting through \"The Island\", I kept thinking to myself \"Boy, this looks familiar.\" In fact, \"The Island\" is almost a complete, play-by-play clone (ba da ching!) of \"Parts\", right down to the outfits worn by the clones. There is currently a lawsuit against Bay brought by the makers of \"Parts\", which should be an open-and-shut case.   This film is set in a futuristic clone colonie, where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts. The clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility's employees, not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise (the Island). Of course, the clones allegedly going to the Island are actually being euthanized for their organs, their patrons having gotten sick. The movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise. Ewan McGregor is satisfactory in this role, his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge. His female counterpart, Scarlet Johansen, is pure eye candy, a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead (or even a major part) in a college play (the best performance is turned in by Sean Bean, the Evil Scientist√Ø¬ø¬Ω.)There is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on, making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie, but it is not only nothing special, it is nothing original.

Now you're problably saying &quot;yea I already knew that, so what?&quot;. But what you problably  didn't know is that Jack used literature to show how beautiful and ugly  human beings can be. Kerouac was a man equally feminine as he was masculine  (read Charter's biography about his relationships with Ginzy, N.C., as well  as the women of his life.) All of this is touched on in the video  documentary, which thrives off the somber emotion,and that sort of  &quot;grey sky comtemplation&quot; of things, which seems to pervade all of  Jack's work.  The video moves through Jack's life in a fairly  straightforward manner. We see him as a shy french speaking Mass.  adolescent, a cleft chinned Columbia undergraduate, a rucksack wanderer,a  chanting buddhist,an aloof catholic, who loved his mother and drank much  too much Johnnie Walker.  In &quot;What happnened to Jack?&quot; we see  Jack as who he really was, a confused, tortured, disenfranchised,happy,  unhappy writer who was very good at putting words together, which gave an  honest glimpse of what was going on in his heart and his mind.  There are  many great moments in the video. Any beat &quot;junkie&quot; will love the  footage of Jack and Allen coolin' it near Columbia, smoking cigarettes and  shootin' pool.  There's a clip of Bird and Diz blowing hot jazz, the beats  in S.F. at the debut of Ginzy's &quot;Howl&quot;, Mike McClure, Jack,  Snyder and Ferlinghetti at Big Sur recitin' and writin' smooth synapses of  the happenings there and around. There are countless anecdotes and picturs  of all your &quot;beat heroes&quot;, which portray them as strikingly  regular and very un-heroic.    The video as a complete work is very  delicious, but the tastiest bits come when Jack reads &quot;October in the  Railroad Earth&quot; to a montage of San Francisco images. When a debonair   Jack reads &quot;On the Road&quot; to Steve Allen's bluesy piano in perfect  phrasing and time. And last but not least there is the comical and  strangely serious Greg Corso explaining genious, fame, and why he thinks  the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; was a phenomenon. Kerouac would problably  want you to see this video because it shows that he was not a fad, an icon,  nor a saviour for a generation. He was simply a regular man trying to find  answers to very un-regular questions and he used his writing talent to  unravel those mysteries",

            "input": "All in all, pretty good . All the Little Animals follows the off-kilter adventures of Bobby Platt (Christian Bale), a young man who's been left a simpleton by the long-ago car accident that damaged his brain but not his soul. He wholeheartedly loves animals and he's got a pet mouse named Peter, but Bobby has to keep Peter hidden from his wicked stepfather, De Winter (Daniel Benzali). Unable to handle De Winter's abuse any longer Bobby runs away, hitchhiking from London to Cornwall, where he meets Mr. Summers (John Hurt). Summers is a quiet man who's devoted his life to giving dead animals a reverent burial, and he trains Bobby to follow in his footsteps.     Even though the movie's title is All the Little Animals, there aren't any developed animal characters. Peter is cute, but he's out of the picture pretty quick. The rest are corpses, or depicted in wistful dream sequences (the fox is a fixture, and there's also an otter, a horse and a beaver). The human characters are sort of one-dimensional - particularly The Fat - but the actors are all superb. Benzali and Hurt's reputations precede them, but Bale is very underrated. That may change when his high-profile role of Batman hits the big screen, but as of now the general public doesn't know him. He's an actor of great range, proven by his equally convincing portrayals of simple and sweet Bobby Platt in All the Little Animals and diabolical, murderous Patrick Bateman in American Psycho shortly after.

This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. \"Saturday Night Fever\" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.    I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.    Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.    But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.    The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out \"the Limey\" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.    Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right (\"Saturday Night Fever\" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame",

I've seen Adam Sandler in numerous movies (and hated most of them), but as humble, wishy-washy Dave Buznik, Sandler is at his low-key best.  Buznik is the last person to have an anger management problem, but following a fateful series of miscues (and hysterically funny miscues at that) he is ordered by a judge to attend an anger management course.  And this is not just any old course:  This is a course led by the unorthodox and dysfunctional Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson's inherent creepiness is perfect for this role).  Nicholson and Sandler play off one another in grand fashion; the goofy therapist pushing the mild-mannered Buznik to the edge--and beyond--is mucho fun to watch!    An added delight to this campy comedy is the plethora of camoes, including John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson (also hysterically funny), Rudy Giuliani, and New York Yankee greats (and ex-greats) Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.  ANGER MANAGEMENT is pure fun, complete with milquetoast ending and wacky Nicholson facial expressions.  Enjoy!  --D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING",

There aren't any terrible episodes this season, Qpid is a bit silly with the crew as Robin Hood characters - most of the stories are strong. \"Future Imperfect\" continues the brinkmanship between the Federation and the Romulans (with Andreas Katsulas of Babylon 5 fame and Riker telling Picard to \"shut up\"), \"Data's day\" is an entire episode from Data's perspective, \"The Wounded\" introduces us to the Cardassians, \"First Contact\" is what Star Trek's all about, then we get into \"The Mind's Eye\" and \"Redemption\" where the Romulan, Klingon and Federation triangle plot finally starts to come out.",

However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack).

            "input": "Interesting Archival Footage Grafted onto Bad History . This production is misleadingly named.  Far from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family.    I do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography.  After all, how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege?  However, I do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history.  And I am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna Anderson was really Anastasia.    This work's take on the life of Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their reputation among today's Russians.    First, life in the inner sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims.  Certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal.  But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of it.  They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble.  While these forces might not have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times.    Secondly, this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong.  While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov restoration among the leadership of the White Army.  Nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family.  In fact, one senior White military leader once remarked, \"having seen the monarchy at close quarters, I have no desire to see its return.\"    And thirdly, while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims.  In fact, the great masses of modern Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on a throne.    I do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives.  But -- whatever the reason(s) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance novel",

For all the care they put into this fine, textured story of a pedophilia scandal in a Catholic orphanage in 1970s Newfoundland, the filmmakers can't let go of the conventional dichotomy of child abuse dramas: grim, teeth-gnashing villains and righteous, just-folks heroes.  It's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama.  Henry Czerny, though, gives  a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing, and Lise Roy is superb as his wife in the film's second part.  And the Canadians go further than American filmmakers ever could or would, suggesting how available the boys' bodies are, and what could be attractive about them.  Finally, the whole snowbound, wood-paneled production is goregous to look at.  Subject matter aside, if you doubt that Canada is a distinct place from the United States, take in the sights, sounds, and attitudes of this small epic",

The story/script is really appalling and Bruce Humberstone, a frequently poor director, adds nothing.  Grable plays a secretary doubling as a night club performer.  As far as plot, that is about it.    In typical Fox fashion, the colour and sound are excellent. Grable looks attractive but the makeup is quite heavy, particularly the bleached blonde hair.  She was pregnant during shooting and the costumes have been designed to hide this. One would hope that Martha Raye and Joe E Brown would help but the material is so bad that they are just noisy and distracting.   Most of the songs are lousy too - duds like \"Don't Carry Tales\".      Two redeeming feature - the song \"Once too Often\" as Hermes Pan and Grable perform a tame Apache dance and the title tune, nicely sung by Grable in close up.    The film represents Hollywood cynicism at its worst.  Fox built a film around Grable's status as THE pin up of World War 2 but neglected to give her a script or a decent leading man. Not to worry, the public will come anyway and, of course, so they did.  In the long run, though, junk like this chips away at the reputation of this appealing star who barely holds the film together by sheer star quality, her pretty face and her sense of humour.  If you are not an ardent Grable fan, you'll hate the film.          \"Pin Up Girl\" really supports the view that Betty Grable made poor films which don't warrant revival.  In fact many of them are first rate entertainments but certainly not this one!  It should, however, be noted that the print of the film in this DVD is excellent and among the extras is an entertaining deleted number which can be seen already in the Hidden Hollywood series",

They universally agree that latest Woody Allen's comedies suck - and I believe that they (Woody's comedies not the critics) are funny and enjoyable. Plus, Jane Fonda came out of retirement to make \"Monster-In-Law\", her first movie in 15 years. I saw a few weeks ago Fonda's \"Barbarella\", one of the silliest and campiest movies ever made and I liked it a lot, mostly due to Fonda's charm.     I watched \"Monster-in-Law\" last night and I found it uninteresting, boring, and irritating. The worst quality - it is not funny. Forget about laughs, I hardly smiled at all. I almost fell asleep - its 101 minutes seemed like eternity. Every twist in so- called plot was predictable, every joke -stupid, the ending - sappy and mediocre. In one word, the movie was a mess with only one redeeming value - Wanda Sykes (Ruby) as Fonda's personal assistant. Both, J.Lo and JF tried hard to do something with the material but it just did not work. In the perfect world, if Woody Allen had written the script and made the movie with three of them, Fonda, Lopes, and Sykes - we could've had if not a masterpiece but a wonderful and funny comedy.

After watching this one time through you will either think it was an awesome production of action and effects (geared towards those with a small attention span and thirst for raw action rather than a good story line) or that it is a complete mess. I admit that I enjoyed what I thought was mindless entertainment, but at the same time was left slightly disappointed with what I thought was a Hollywoodish Anime (not a good thing). However I was fortunate to see one OVA  at a time, therefore I watched the first OVA about three times, the second two times and at last all three together (these three are what make up the contents of this DVD). So by the time I finished this first half of the story I pretty much understood it.  This DVD entails a complicated kaleidoscope of events that eventually jumble into a collage of a story.  Honestly this is a very good anime with a very good story once you are able to breath it all in. It appears as a mess because the director throws everything at you almost at once; however I believe that is what he intends. As the story goes on the knots that make up the story untwine (OVA to OVA). So expect the first OVA to be the most complicated and confusing. but if you Read the summary first the story will make more sense the first time you watch it.   Finally, the animation and CG is second to none. It is an extremely beautiful anime.    Sooo, I highly recommend reading the summery on the back of the box first",

            "input": "Definitive Trilogy of Streisand's Three Romantic Wallows . This collection of three epochal films from Barbra Streisand's film career all share the swooning romanticism that has become her cinematic trademark as both actress and filmmaker. All succeed in satisfying her fans even if there are undeniable lapses that may try the patience of other viewers.      The earliest is 1973's \"The Way We Were\", which has becomes an emotional touchstone for a generation who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances. Veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents wrote a strong, multi-dimensional character for her in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling.     In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles.    But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, \"The Way We Were: A Look Back\". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures.     The second film is 1991's \"The Prince of Tides\". In only her second directorial effort (after \"Yentl\"), Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis. She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.     The movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. It is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay.     The movie is not without flaws. First, after a powerfully cathartic scene that feels like the movie's climax, the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein and a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Regardless, it's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.    The last movie is the weakest of the trio, 1996's \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\", still her last starring vehicle. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably. At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale.     As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in \"The Prince of Tides\". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves. At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in \"The Owl and the Pussycat\") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role.    This is a worthy collection for any Streisand fan",

            "input": "A romantic/emotional roller coaster . Why some have condemned this movie for the lack of story line, I praise what factual information they were able to find although there was never any final meeting between Hemmingway and Agnes.  All correspondence was done through letters between them after Hemmingway went home from the war and little is known of the letters Hemmingway wrote Angus since a later boyfriend of Angus destroyed all of Hemmingway's letters in a jealous rage.  If there was in final face to face meeting, both their lives may have very different.  More than likely the two would have continued far different lives together.  Hemmingway may have never gone on to become the great writer he was and Agnes would have never continued her nursing career that she seemed much more married to, or a European whirlwind romance may have faded into the first of the many failed marriages Hemmingway went through.    Although a bit contrived from reality; the story line does make an impact emotionally.    In my opinion though Sir Richard Attenborough should have had his lead actors at least read A Farewell to Arms before attempting their roles.  It might have helped out with acting that was a little flat and emotionless at times like they didn't have enough material on the original characters and were trying to ad lib.  Still it's very much worthwhile watching this sometimes fictional account of a young Hemmingway and his first and lost love",

            "input": "Poor adaptation . As said by other reviewers, a lot of what was in the original story was changed, and the film was updated to the time period where it was. The boys are American, from a military school, and talk about fear of the Russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams. The choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals. I don't want to sound like I'm stereotyping people in the military, but people in general already think there's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal.    Basically, I think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost. You don't feel like there's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the 1963 film. For example, during the bonfire sequence Jack is shouting out directions: \"OK, you be the pig, we'll be the hunters,\" and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire. (not actually hurting him, mind you, just chasing him) That's not chaos nor barbarism, that's an organized celebration. It's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation. The director tries to play this scene out like it's a terrible thing, but it just doesn't come across that way.    I might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation, that being the John Hurt \"1984.\" That film, if I recall correctly, didn't have a single \"Big Brother is Watching You.\" Likewise, this film doesn't have a single, \"Kill the pig, spill her blood!\" That's right, the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie. Actually, a kid in one scene says quietly, \"We killed a pig.\" That's about it. This leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior. The fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal, chanting and screaming, \"KILL THE PIG! SLIT HER THROAT! SPILL HER BLOOD!\" was one of the most poignant moments of the book and 1963 film, and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to \"Tell me about the rabbits, George.\"    On a final note, the character of Piggy is ruined in this film. Danuel Pipoly was terrible in the role, and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play. I don't wanna give too much away, but I was happy when \"something something\" happened to him. That sounds mean but it's true, and it's a very bad thing in a film like this.    This film could have been good, but it fails on all levels. The transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable, making the whole point of the story lost on the audience. The best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end, and he's in about ten seconds of film time. I hate comparing it to the 1963 film version so much, but I would really suggest people see that instead. Avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion",

Lucille Ball's second TV Show \"The Lucy Show\" doesn't seem to come close to her first, the extremely popular \"I Love Lucy\", in amount of reruns syndicated on television.

Lucy's less-than-efficient secretarial skills and wacky hijacks frequently infuriate her boss, but somehow she is loyal to him not matter what. The five episodes included in this DVD feature some famous guest stars including Carol Burnette (playing Lucy's librarian roommate Carol), and John Wayne, Milton Berle, Ruta Lee, and George Burns. Like in \"I Love Lucy\", Lucille's character fawning over the movie stars is very amusing and even though the series was made a decade after \"I Love Lucy\", she still does much of her physical comedy pretty well. The picture quality of the episodes is not the best and the menu navigation for the DVD is somewhat confusing, but those problems are not bad enough to distract from the shows. While its not quite as good as Lucy's first show, it's still a great show and worth a look if you enjoy \"I Love Lucy\" or Lucille Ball",

I am speaking specifically about her ideas she got from her conversations with the FBI and her tips on how to deal with a maniac at the table. I really thought those two areas were exceptional. It always seems like common sense after you hear it, but she really does clear a lot of things up and does a good job of providing a lot of information.     A few downsides to mention: She discusses a lot about tells and sizing up an opponent. I only play online, so this stuff didn't help me. Also, when she discusses a tell, she performs it herself as she talks about it. When Lederer discussed tells in his DVD, he had actors play them out in a scenario, which I thought was both entertaining and more helpful to remember. The DVD never leaves a poker table with her just talking--which decreases the desire to watch it a lot of times. Had she ventured into the casino a few times to show a hand or something to change things up a little, I think it would have been better. Basically, the DVD gets a little boring after watching it a time or two.     Wrapping up this review, you have Annie Duke sharing her thoughts on how to take care of business at the poker table. It might not be the most entertaining DVD you ever buy, but there is some good information on the DVD. Definitely worth the price to have a pro player give up 90 minutes of their time. If you only play poker online, you can skip this one and wait for her online poker DVD. It should be a better choice. If you play some live poker, I think you'll definitely want to know the information on this DVD. It could really make you more dangerous at the tables.",

You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop.

But, of course, something goes wrong. They go to London and Jack becomes a hero when he saves a higly ranked Englishman's life. But, in the process, he kills one of the terrorists that attacked him. And the brother of the guy he killed isn't pleased. And that terrorist and his pals go to the U.S to get revenge, mainly by targeting Ryan's wife and kid. So Ryan is on the most important case of his life where he has to save his family. The movie includes one very suspensful scene where the terrorists are in a van on the highway shooting machine guns at Ryan's wife's Porsche. That should make you want to watch it. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good thriller, Tom Clancy style.",

The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy...    When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails).    Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford.    As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant.  But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge...    Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try...    The DVD Repor",

SEXY BEAST is a fantastic but underrated indie classic. Like some of the other reviewers, I could watch this movie over and over again.    Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a retired London mobster now living in Spain, going to fat in idyllic bliss with his former porn actress wife Dee Dee (Amanda Redman) and their best friends, a married couple they've known from when they were back in the life. Into their domestic paradise enters Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), another 'old friend,' showing up unannounced, telling Gal he has a job for him and \"No is not an answer.\"    Logan is one of those small wiry guys who make up for what they lack in height and muscle with an extra dose of psychotic meanness. Crime boss Teddy Bass (excellently played with menacing reticence by Ian McShane) is planning an ambitious heist on a prestigious bank, Logan is to help assemble the crew. Logan wants Gal in on the job and, as far as he's concerned, he's already made Gal's mind up for him. For Logan it is only a matter of how little stroking he will need to do before he strikes.    In one scene, it's late and everyone is in bed, except Logan who is in the bathroom shaving. Standing in front of the mirror he starts thinking about Gal's refusal earlier in the evening. He begins muttering. Needing to relieve himself, he continues thinking and muttering as he urinates all over the floor. By now, having worked himself up into a rage, he runs out the bathroom with shaving cream still on his face, down the hall and, screaming \"No! No! No!\" storms into Gal and Dee Dee's bedroom kicking and punching the poor man out of his own bed.    Another scene in the movie shows Logan sitting on a plane which will soon depart. Thinking nothing of consideration for fellow passengers, or rules and regulations, he lights up a cigarette. When one of the passengers mildly protests, Logan calmly but coldly informs the man that if he must put out the cigarette, he will be putting it out on him. When a flight attendant intervenes, Logan gets up, grabs his bag and --after telling all onboard he hopes the plane crashes and they all die-- demands to get off. After being removed and brought to airport security, Logan explains to the security officer the incident was all a case of nerves. He concocts a tale about a male flight attendant groping him while boarding! With a straight face, he tells the man that he felt violated and was literally in shock, not even realizing he was smoking a cigarette! Of course, he doesn't wish to make a fuss about any of it and would just like to leave and forget the whole thing.    He walks out the airport, right into a taxi and back to making Gal's life hell. I couldn't stop laughing!    Ben Kingsley does for SEXY BEAST what Joe Pesci did for GOODFELLAS. Both portray sociopaths, incapable of true consideration and comapassion. The way they selfishly crash through life is so disturbing it's comes off comical.    Not giving too much of the story away, but Gal does return to London to do the job. However, not for the reasons you might think. Instead, something occurs which makes Gal feel it necessary to get to London, complete the job and return to Spain quickly as possible. Ian McShane is brilliant in this final segment of the film.",

In spite of the fact the novel's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant Japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between Eastern and Western worlds around a lot of issues, the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal, transforming it into an interesting film, whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures, with Sean Connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations. Yet Sean Connery makes a very credible performance, as the detective, the script seems uncapable to surmount the anecdothic character of good guys and bad guys, and the ominous presence of the Japanese mob with pretensions of Noir Film, the picture leaves us a bitter taste, because even if there are good sequences, the whole material promised best best and major intentions.",

With a pacing that only Tsai Ming-liang could love and deliberate scenery shots that you are forced to enjoy \"House of Sand\" steps into the genre best described as the Foreign Doldrums. Moving as fast as thick molasses never wins any points in my book and considering that that seems to be the main goal of this film we didn't get along too well. The entirety of the movie takes place in the Brazilian desert, a place that we movie fans rarely get to see. However, as you may have guessed, not a lot happens out there. There isn't even a weeping camel out there to keep us company. We watch as a crazy old guy moves his family out into the middle of nowhere (no explanation given) and then dies, stranding everybody else there for three generations. I know, how can I criticize a plot for not having any developments (other than the startling revelation that somewhere out yonder sells salt!) when in reality nothing would ever happen to these characters. And to that I would say that this was not the best yarn to commit to film.    Pretty much everything goes as would be expected. People walk around bored, some of them die off, there are some minor romances, and everything looks beautiful. About ten years in a group of soldiers shows up and Aurea, the crazy man's wife, desperate for anything that moves, strikes up a love affair with one of them. He promises to take her out of the desert, but unforeseen problems prevent that from happening. Throughout more soldiers will arrive, and the females will always view them as tickets out of town, there to be seduced and exploited. Do I believe that these fellow travelers are the only way these women could escape their destiny? Maybe, maybe not. In the end the point is made that living in the Brazilian desert is just about the same as living on the moon, to which I would have to think that moving your family into the middle of the desert and then croaking might to be too smart.    Another minor complaint I would like to air is the usage of the same actors to play different roles. It would be fine, in a \"Three Times\" kind of way, had they bothered to label the passage of time. Instead I was left playing catch up thinking that somehow the grandma had risen from the grave. There is a fairly graphic sex scene somewhere in the middle that might shock you out of your slumber, but really the only use it has is spicing up this overtly bland stew. You have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch a movie like this, and even then it is nearly impossible for the director to pull off. \"Rain\" and \"Elephant\" leap to mind as masterpieces of this technique. These characters really may have been marooned out in no man's land, but unfortunately for the filmmakers the exit of the theater is just a few short steps away. I wasn't lucky enough to have seen this in theaters, but I would have been mighty interested to see how many people took a walk. Awe-inspiring cinematography does not make a movie. . .and here is my proof. **1/4",

The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.     My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.     Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film.

Hell, I remember when I was a kid finding it in the \"horror\" section of the local video store!  Though the film does have it's exploitation elements for sure, Class Of 1984 is a damn good movie.  It could have been promoted as a more serious film(it actually was intended to be a more serious drama) and win over more critics, but like they mention in the documentary featurette, the scenes of violence and punk rockers and such were enough to prejudice some people into thinking the movie was something less than what it actually was.  I never saw much of Perry King's work before or after this, but he's a very good choice as a kind of wimpy music teacher who thinks that through the power of knowledge, he can help the troubled teen, Timothy Van Patten.  In fact, King's music class is probably the best behaved of the entire school with Van Patten as the only real rotten apple in the bunch...when he attends.  Pretty boy Van Patten is kind of a teenage Godfather who runs drugs and hookers out of a punk rock club.  His gang consists of three annoying thugs and one very annoying chick.  When King pisses Van Patten off, the war begins.  It starts off pretty simple with vandalism and practical jokes, but ends up being quite deadly.  King goes through the movie in the role of dogooder throughout all of Van Patten's antics.  I think most guys would have broken down long before King's character does, but when King does break down it's well worth the wait.  If you let yourself get into the story, this movie will make your blood boil as you feel the frustration King feels.  Whenever he retaliates, he's the one who gets in trouble, though you know he's really not doing anything wrong.  It's like in real school where a guy would hit you with a spitball and no one would ever see him, but you'd be the one caught when you fired a spitball back.  Plus the frustration mounts coz every rotten act Van Patten commits is brushed off coz \"no one saw him do it\" and the fact that he's a juvenile.  The film builds to a fantastic final confrontation that gets downright brutal.  Lots of great performances all around.  Van Patten should have gone on to be a bigger star, but it never happened.  He's does a great job as the evil, sly psychopath.  Of course special praise must be given to Roddy McDowell.  He's fantastic in this.  They couldn't have picked a better guy for the job.  Many thanks go out to Anchor Bay for putting this great film out on dvd.  There's a good halfhour documentary on the disc that speaks mainly to director Lester, as well as two of the actors.  Recommended very highly.  Yesiree, Bob",

As many have said - it seems that George Reeves was the one and only person to portray Superman. He had the charm,  charisma, the classic fine features, sense of humor, as well as very appealing vocal and acting qualities many actors today I'm sure - wish they had. And of course - that wonderful smile of his that few could resist. I have read that he was a very nice person to work with on the set and was always very sensitive and kind to others.  However - I'm not sure if everyone out there who loved him in the role knew how much he loved children and how much he did for them. I've heard and read many interviews about him and his portrayal of Superman and how he would devote many hours entertaining sick children in hospitals as the man of steel. Many children indeed - looked up to him as their own Superman and the great and wholesome role model he portrayed.  \"Around The World With Superman\" the last episode in the second season dvd, very nicely shows George's sensitivity and love for children as he tries to help a young blind girl regain her sight  and takes her on a once in a lifetime flight around the world - in his arms. When he first visits the girl in her mother's apartment as Clark Kent and as Superman - with the aid of the wonderful background music that made the 50's series so memorable  and enjoyable - one can clearly see George Reeve's love for children in his voice and the things he says to her and way he  looks at the young girl.   Indeed - a very touching and sensitive episode, and in my humble opinion - a very nice and memorable tribute to George.",

Though some people consider Cobb the greatest, I don't recall ever seeing any name higher than Mr. Ruth in any book, on any list, with the exception of one book which places Willie Mays at the top. So with that statement, there should be many sports fans and historains who would want to check this movie/DVD out (though it's a little light on actual baseball *playing* - too bad, because the photography/camera work is terrific).  Tommy Lee Jones plays the part as if he's auditioning for the part of Mephistofolies; or Sweeney Todd; it's surely \"over the top\" but he dominates every single scene he's in, actually over-running (with no sharpened spikes) Mr. Rhul, playing the (now) legendary sports writer Al Stump. In \"real life\", it seems Stump had to deal with a relatively tame but decidedly moody lion, in motel rooms, in banquet halls, in lounges, all over the place.  The movie portrays a somewhat self-righteous writing genuis, as it constantly refers to his own personal troubles - the more he yells at his employer, who ultimately he does befriend, albeit cautiously, the more the very perceptive, though dying 72 year old man, reminds him of his own mess as a  filanderer and failed husband. There's a rather unconvincing scene towards the end of the picture, when at some motel Stump is presented with Divorce papers and he begins to fire Cobb's gun in the direction of this guy who's been chasing him around the country for this purpose. The script is very strong throughout but here the scene ends on a depressing note. What was needed was for Cobb to simply convey through his eyes \"Wanna throw any more \"stones\" at *me*, son?\" Well, maybe that's a bit trite, but the scene closes as Lee says that he saw nothing - just a coupla bad boys.  Lolita Davidovitch has some good scenes, but her 1960 Vegas Cocktail Waitress has the look but not the \"feel\", meaning Shelton probably had to make her a milennium feminist to fit the quasi-political contemporary movie industry demands. Keeping the character more to the period would have worked.  Another concession to the male-female spirit of today, not 1960, is in a deleted scene: Stump watches, through his office window, and in the company of his Secretary, a shapely lady ascend a staircase. In the midst of his confusion and disorientation, he tells his exasperated co-worker to tell his wife, who has just called, well, tell her something. I wonder what the \"real\" Al Stump thought of that kind of stuff.  Tyrus Raymond Cobb surely fought death...and life. In his profession, he reached high, refusing to be taken lightly or be beaten. As his violent world finally came crashing in, and his health was in free-fall, he still refused to acknowledge his vulnerability, his mortality. Maybe that's the only real lesson to be learned by all of this: even a wicked man can sustain by calling up his reserve of strength and courage; maybe even artfulness.   Mr. Shelton delivers a very interesting narrative of the back story,  though he sounds very subdued - perhaps the memory that the kind of numbers the Georgia Peach drew out to the old ball park did not exactly compare to this movie about his last days",

Yul Brynner stars in INVITATION TO A GUNFIGHTER, a western with a conscience from 1964, a bad time for westerns made in the lower 48.  Brynner plays Jules Gaspard d'Estaing (Jewel, for short,) a silk-shirted top-notch gun for hire who's enlisted by a small southwestern town to shoot George Segal, a young man returning from the Civil War who, much to town owner and chief psychopath Pat Hingle's horror and disgust, fought for the Confederacy.  Segal returns to town bereft of farm, stolen--- er, claimed and sold by Hingle while he was gone - and sweetheart Janice Rule, a New England lass who married a one-armed piano player out of pity.  After Segal tries to take back his farm, rather forcefully and impulsively, Hingle's hatred for all things southern boils over and he hires one of the best guns in the lawless west.       At some point in the movie Brynner's character observes that this cowed frontier town is filled with hens (Civil War widows) and capons (injured vets of that war.)  It can be ruled by anyone with enough moxie to take it over, and hence we're given the reason why Hingle's character is named Brewster - well, it rhymes with rooster, anyway, and his penchant for quoting and paraphrasing passages from the Bible is Hollywood's shorthand way of telling us he's either a fraud or criminally demented.  In any event, the slave system  Segal may (underline and italicize the word `may') have been fighting to protect and defend is clumsily contrasted with the Hingle-led town's treatment of women and resident Mexicans.  Neither can vote in town councils, the Mexicans can't buy ammunition to kill game to feed their families, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.       Which reminds me, Brynner ain't half-bad as the suave and conflicted gun slinger.  It probably goes without saying that there was only one man, recently returned from the war, who treated the resident Mexicans with any respect.  That fact doesn't escape Brynner's attention, anyway, and it sets up the Big Conflict - does a hired gun let outside factors interfere with his contract to kill?  INVITATION TO A GUNFIGHTER would have been a whole lot better if it hadn't tried so hard to prove the town's moral hypocrisy, if it hadn't spent so much time developing a sticky romantic quadrangle between Rule, Brynner, Segal, and the One-Armed Man, and especially if it hadn't loaded a simple story with so much `message.'  Westerns, and action movies in general, work best when the connection between motivation and action is simple and direct.  In ItaG that connection is hopelessly, and needlessly, tangled.  Brynner has a lithe intensity that rises above the material and almost, but not quite, carries this movie along with him.",

            "input": "\"He found himself yearning to know of their affairs\", . Directed by Saul Dibbs, this opulent adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty - his decadent coming of age novel about love, class, sex and money set in the hypocritical Thatcherite Eighties - is indeed a feast for the eye.  Beautifully acted, with a spot-on affinity for detailing time and place, The Line of Beauty replicates Hollinghurst's hedonistic themes and the moral quandaries of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens), the titular middle-class outsider in this world of privilege.    As with the book, this film adaptation begins in 1983 when the young twenty-year-old Nick Guest is asked by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to come and stay with his family in their sumptuous Notting Hill home in the Kensington Park Gardens estate. Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a sycophantic Tory Member of Parliament who is on the rise, and is basking in the glory of Thatcher's economic policies. Gerald lives with loyal wife Rachel (Alice Krigg), his daughter Catherine (Hayle Atwell), and Toby.    Nick's comes from a provincial, terribly middle class background - his father is a humble antiques dealer - but he is welcomed into the Fedden family like a type of surrogate son and over time, he becomes a kind of minder to the neurotic and troubled Catherine. Nick is wined and dined, enthusiastically partaking of the family's lavish parties and political dinners, trying to impress them in their superficial discussions on literature, art and antiques.     Nick tries his best to promote civility amongst their affluent boredom, but he's unsure of his footing in this opulent, prosperous looking-glass world. In fact, Dan Stevens plays Nick with a kind of wide-eyed, eloquent fury, always nicely mannered, but forever hidden is the ever-present pretension and affectation, and as he gazes hopefully into the gilt arch of the hall mirror, this troubled man finds it reluctant to give its approval.     Nick constantly has to remind himself that he is doing this all for pleasure, yet when he falls in love with Leo, (Don Gilet) a lusty black cockney and socialist council worker, he finds himself caught in a Jamesian-like dilemma, wedged between the powerful, privileged life led by the Feddens and their friends, whilst also having to face the stark realities of Eighties Britain - the vast unemployment and the rise of AIDS.     The second and third episodes of the series feature Nick's relationship with Wani (Alex Wyndham), a long-lashed Lebanese millionaire playboy. While working as a creative consultant on Wani's new magazine, Ogee - named after the curve that is Hogarth's line of beauty - Nick is introduced to a world of non-stop threesomes, moneyed decadence, and cocaine-fueled days and nights. And of course this all culminates in the beautifully recreated coke-fuelled dance with \"The Lady\" herself, the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (Kika Markham).    This BBC adaptation follows Hollinghurst's book pretty much to the letter, although in some instances, the film fails to catch much of the subtleness and nuance of the source material. The scenes involving Nick's sex and coke binges in the toilets and bedrooms of his grand surroundings seem hurriedly cut short, and the pivotal scene of the dreary piano recital fails to capture the tiniest social shenanigans and inherent boredom of all the guests as well as it could.     Also, when the Fedden's take Nick on their holiday to France, the pacing slows a bit, but thankfully picks up speed again in readiness for the final d√Ø¬ø¬Ωnouement, the penultimate dance with The Lady. The cast is solid throughout, but Stevens is without a doubt the standout, imbuing Nick with a neediness and an obvious desire to be loved. He speaks his emotions and is in need of reassurance of his place within the Fedden household. He exists in a limbo space of not quite belonging, and in innocence of the dark undertones of the world he has entered.     Amidst the euphoria of first love, champagne and high society parties, the young graduate witnesses political scandal, deception, and the ultimate hypocrisy towards his sexuality, and that of his bretheren. The unsaid mantra is that it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you keep it quiet and do it in private. The Line of Beauty is indeed a richly textured coming-of-age story, and accomplished adaptation of a classic work of literature set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade of change and transformation.

One of the great period pieces that the Brits do so well, this is the story of the British bomb disposal squads during World War Two, done by John Hawkesworth, the same guy who produced \"Upstairs, Downstairs.\"  The story is told through a fictional bomb disposal squad commanded by a young engineering student turned lieutenant, Brian Ash.    Fascinating story and technical details when they stick to the actual bomb disposal material, but the personal stories are so much cliched fluff--the main one is that Ash falls in love with the daughter of a scientist working on the bomb disposal effort.  They are temporarily blocked by the fact that she already has a husband who is also doing an important job--he is one of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park working on the Enigma secret.  But not to worry--hubby obligingly kills himself so the lovers can get together with a clear conscience.  As the Church lady would say \"How convenient!\"    Also the one extra is nothing much, a documentary from the History Channel, not on the British bomb disposal effort during the War, but just a general piece on bomb disposal in general.

Matt Damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam! Danny Devito is slimy, shady, sarcastic, and sleazy (in other words, perfect Devito) as Damon's partner.    The main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia. The sleazy Big Insurance Company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter. They bet wrong! Our hero, guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge (Dixon from Alias), come to the rescue.    The pieces fit together quite nicely. Justice is served, bad guys are taken down, and Matt Damon establishes himself as an unlikely, unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process.    Nothing wrong with this story or this film. Very delightful and satisfying in every respect.",

I've been studying pilates and gyrotonics for six years with some of the top instructors in NYC but with the increasing popularity of pilates, the sessions have gotten absurdly expensive, which is why I wanted to try a DVD. I have never been one to work out in my home, but ths is truly an amazing workout and not only have I saved so much money by doing this DVD instead of my beloved studio sessions, but I'm able to incorporate it into my busy schedule and do it much more often than I ever could with the sessions.     As the reviews before me have indicated, the DVD is broken up into four segments that each target a specific area, but I think that's slightly misleading. While about sixty or seventy percent of the exercises in each section do target the area they are labeled under, each section also contains a variety of stretches and counter-workouts as well, which make for a more overall workout, whether you're doing one section or four at a time. For instance, in the section entitled \"abs\" you'll also find exercises that strengthen the back muscles and legs. Therefore, you're able to get a lot of variety and a great overall workout!     ******NOTE:  I recommend this highly for intermediates and advanced students of pilates, but NOT for beginners!!!  In order to do these exercises correctly, you must know the basic pilates foundation such as pelvic placement, breathing techniques, and proper alignment. If you are attempting these exercises as a beginner, they may seem straightforward, but without the proper foundation and knowledge (which is NOT explained), you may not be doing the exercises properly and worse, could get hurt.*******    For those who are newer to pilates, I would recommend perhaps watching the video first, as it moves at what I would consider a fast intermediate pace.",

            "input": "\"I found him.  He'll be here very shortly.\" . Henri-Georges Clouzot's \"Diabolique\" is a film that falls short of its potential.  Its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise, suffocating atmosphere, and top-notch acting.       Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the director of a boarding school.  Christina is Michel's wife and Nicole is his mistress.  Both are frequent victims of his abusive nature.  The two women carry out their plan perfectly but Michel's body disappears soon after they dispose of it.  Even more troubling to Christina and Nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive.       \"Diabolique\" is graced with three outstanding performances.  Meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers' ire while Clouzot and Signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers.  The film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once Michel's body disappears.  However, the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film.  The ending is not clever, shocking, or surprising.  It is just plain disappointing.  Too put it simply, \"Diabolique\" is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line.",

NO NO NO!, but it unfolds like a hilariously awesome classic the likes of which ive only seen from old school anime films of the late 80s/early 90s.    If the matrix was suppost to be a Ghost In The Shell rip off, then this film, The Legend 2, embodies even more of what the matrix was supposivly influenced by.      NOOOO...this is not a cold hearted all serious flick...it doesnt take it self overly seriously...yet it is at the same time quite INSPIRING...    Now this is the genuis of this little film, its not this masterwork of film making...yet it has times of genuine hilarity, while still stirring your spirit in awe. Something like this can be a little toung-n-check, yet still evokes one's admiration.   Without sounding to lofty on the descriptions here, people, The Legend 2 might of not been exactly like the chinese language version...But it is very memorable in its own right...     The voice actors behind the talented cast here are some from the finest films in Japanese Anime...thats right...you might notice some from Ninja Scroll...Project A-Ko...and MORE...These voice actors bring that comprehensive hilarity to the screen....Yes, sorry if i sound like a washed up editoral hack...but bare with me...  For instance... When the men tease Fong about him following his mother around...its just random and so damn funny. And the main bad guy, is great...he's a frstrated bully of a character who at times wont relent at insulting Fong about his closeness to his mom.     And speaking of which , Fong and his \"legendary\" mom are one funny duo. And so is the man who sorta looks after Fong, who was the mothers ex lover i think. He has a funny deep serious voice.    The action looks like it inspires the great anime films...thats right...not inspired by the anime...it seems like it would INSPIRE the anime world itself...It doesnt draw influence from great anime, but i bet films like this inspire japanese artists to create great anime series and stories!     You might not understand all this, but its a different take , a unique review of the film that no one has noticed yet on amazon, for this film anyways.     Sure, this english dub, American version of the film isnt true to the original...But i remember seeing this on tv...and it was even more edited than this im sure...and it was awesome...i taped it...but lost it i think, but now i finally have it, in its entirity.     This film embodies a lot of what makes Kung Fu films so loveable and great. HUMOROUS CHARACTERS, AWESOME ACTION, INSPRING STYLIZATION.    The scene where Fong walks slowly into battle as the colorfull pedals or leaves fall and float down from the sky is just beautifull and has power,cinematographically.....if thats a word, hahaha.     This is a classic...it melds together serious inspiring action and laugh out loud hilarity.     And i havent even seen the first movie yet.    Hope this helped ya out in deciding if you wanna get this movie or not. Its not too expensive...when you buy it, just dont expect some oscar winning film...it aint...its not the greatest film ever produced...  IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE.",

The next thing the doctor and sarah notice, is a man on top of a ridge waving st them. But the doctor and sarah think he is wazing at them as in hello or help.    the next thing the time travelers know is they are buried in tons of rock, well sarah is anyway, the doctor and some of the workers dig sarah out, she is unconcience and grasping a stone hand..............'THE HAND OF FEAR",

I think it showed that her husband had some tendencies towards wanting to dominate his wife, which turned into full-blown abuse under the stresses of losing his job & medical license, and returning to Shiite Iran after decades of living in the United States.    I think the book shows that he wasn't this \"dream husband\" that suddenly turned into a monster. The warning signs were there all along - for example, she met him when he was her physician and he kissed her right on the treatment table - obviously, an inappropriate action.    What was amazing to me is that OTHER AMERICANS in Iran did little to help Betty, saying she needed to submit, what's the problem? etc, while it was the IRANIANS who understood Moody's family history & reached out to help her in a real way - helping her use the phone, finding ways for her to escape the dangerous oppression of her husband, and ultimately smuggling her out of the country.     The movie seems a little overblown, because, well, it's a movie...they dramatize things. I recommend reading the book, too, which is Betty's true story",

I recently received the DVD as a gift and the sound quality is a big improvement over my old vhs copy.  I recommend it for performances, the story and the photography. Jodie Foster's monologue toward the end of the film is particularly memorable. Each girl's story line is realistic and the film itself does a good job of capturing teen life in the late 70s before yuppie values took hold.  This is NOT a John Hughes film and is a refreshing change for anyone who was subjected that director's teen films in the 80s",

The title of this movie is a tad deceptive- it and the soundtrack are the only thing disco related to this soap opera of a movie that carries a script worthy of a \"Sex and the City\" episode. There are some, albeit very few, interesting plot twists. But basically this movie is mostly worthy of a late night movie made by and for Cinemax. Pity too. I'm a huge Chloe Sevigny fan (and not for \"Brown Bunny\" reasons), but her talent is minimally utilized, as is that of her co-stars. I realize this movie is largely about recent college grads and their pretentious entrance into the real world, with the disco night life as a back drop. But their trials and tribulations have little to do with the disco life itself. \"The Club,\" the flick's disco night life place to be, is merely what Central Perk was to the TV show friends- a gathering place to gossip about relatively juvenile adventures in love (or reasonable facsimiles of), and their recent and up to now short durations in the working world. The minimal glances into \"The Club\" itself is archetypal. Were it not for an admittedly clever twist that explains a lot of the behavior of that disco's employees earlier in the movie, the dialogue would be largely mundane, uninspired and testing of the viewers patience. The pay off isn't rewarding enough to rescue one from that experience. Kate Beckinsdale's character is the stereotyical pain in the [...], nose in her friends' business nuisance, and she plays that well. But an annoying character does not a good movie make. And for a movie of this title, the dance scenes are minimal in quantity and display. Were it not for a friend letting me borrow his copy, I wouldn't have even dropped a single dollar to rent this flick. To be fair, the soundtrack is outstanding and solely keeps one following the movie's events. But that's hardly a reason to waste a couple hours watching this film's paint dry. You could probably buy the soundtrack and have a more entertaining experience",

It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-Fran√ßois Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances).     Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film. Its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters, narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph. It is a 190 minutes long film but I cherished every minute of it.",

Unlike Phil Hellmuth's DVDs (which were suprisingly inadequate), Lederer truly takes the viewer through a number of sound, substantive advice and strategy that acheives its goal -- to provoke thought and to tighten your play.  This very much added to my game and gave more, and different perspective(s) to this wonderful game.  An earlier review claimed that it is \"not complete\"...to which I would agree, with one caveat -- can any DVD/book/article truly \"completely\" cover such an intricate game?  Maybe, if it were a collection of 10-12 disks or more...but, even then, there are different perspectives and strategies -- some you may subscribe to , others you may not.  I only wish this DVD had more to it because of the fact that it was very insightful, helpful and instructive...I could have watched another 2 hours of Lederer's teaching.  If you are looking for an instructional course that bucks the trend of those that claim so-called \"million-dollar strategies\" and fall short, and you want to improve your game -- this DVD pays for itself.  Lederer doesn't hold back, afraid of revealing his secrets that may provide for others to beat him at the table.  He lays it out in a great framework, delivering it in a way that of him really wanting to help you in your game.  Another great attribute -- he doesn't drone on and on about his tourney conquests with an air of how great he is (unlike some other DVDs - no names mentioned  Phil).  In fact, I don't recall him talking about any of his \"great moves\", except for situations that he has encountered and the results -- good or bad.  Lederer is a confident player, and it shows in his teaching of the game.  Highly recommended!",

The man is shot and falls into the harbor.  The boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him.  She and a reporter hire a boat to find her father.  Their destination is an island said to be cursed.  The boat they hire is run by a young couple.  Along the way the couple do some diving (she is topless).  She is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it.  She is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks.  The Continue to the island which is just a short distance away.    Once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living.  Legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation.  Unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known.  But soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead.  In the end, only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization.  They keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy.    This is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings.  That aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly.  There is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore, although somewhat tame by today's standards.  The acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent.  I enjoyed the ending which I gather was supposed to be a shocker but which I predicted from the beginning.  My guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead, or so the producers hoped.  If you like zombie films you will have to check this one out",

As the #1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction, including most of the important books about national security, 9/11, oil, and terrorism, I have to state there are exactly TWO points of truth in this shallow stupid little film:     1) the photo of Bush reading a book upside down was a fabrication, Bush was actually listening.    2) Clinton blew it.  Correct. Madeline Albright will go down in history for refusing to let her staff report terrorism honestly, and Tony Lake will go down in history for failing to get it right.  It bears mention that then Commandant of the Marine Corps Al Gray did get it right, in his article \"Global Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's\" published in the fall of 1988, but no one wanted to listen.    I am impressed by the teacher of color who was in charge of the classroom that day, recounting how she felt Bush was truly presidential, and wise not to add to the panic by rushing out of the room.  Absolutely.  Good point.    The rest of this extreme rightist propaganda tract is totally disconnected from reality and the truth.  The movie claims that Gore lost because of Nader, and completely ignores the hard documented proof that the Florida leeadership acted to disenfranchise over 35,000 people of color, one reason that the Bush family was so confident, in advance, of victory in  Florida.  This trashy film fails to address the many angry Representatives and the inert Senate, including Gore, who failed to use the power of Congress to redress the impeachable wrong done to America in 2000 (and again, this time in Ohio, in 2004).    Anything that features snap-shots of Ann Coulter is very likely to be loosely related to the truth, reality, or the public interest.    I am glad I watched this film, because it reconfirms my gravest fears--the extreme right in America now has a propaganda machine more powerful that Hitler's, and a brainwashed following more lethal than the Hilter Youth.  This is seriously troubing stuff.    I gave Moore four stars, one star down for being too glib by half.  That's an honest assessment.  This shallow little movie gets two stars, and both of those are for reflecting what is in the small minds of the nutty right",

Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?    To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.    But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.    But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.     After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.    To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel",

But I will say if you love this movie get the Region 4 version from Australia. Yes you will need a region-free DVD player but it is well worth it. I found one for $35 that I can honestly say is one of the best pieces of electronic equipment I have ever owned. I can watch any movie I want without the powers that be telling me what I can and cannnot watch based on my geography. The previous poster is incorrect. There are scenes that have chopped. Part of one can be seen in the trailer. Nothing was taken out that will muddy the plot. But I have to ask Miramax, why, at a short 90 minutes, would you bother taking out more of the fun? And I truly have a dislike for the voiceovers done to change Aussie references to American. Don't underestimate the viewing audience Miramax! If we are going to watch this movie, most of us will look up any words or phrases we aren't familiar with. Thats part of the fun.     There are 2 versions of this film available in Oz. There's the standard version and The Pool Room Edition. It comes complete with a fuzzy slipcover to imitate a pool table, a lovely keep case with pictures of the cast, sheet music to \"We're Goin' To Bonnydoon\", and a top 10 list of the Kerrigans best deals from the trading post.

The DVDs have an auto-play function, which is handy to the parents or caregiver with the child. The show starts on its own if the menu is left untouched for more than 30 seconds or so. When the episodes are all played out, it goes back to the menu and restarts.    While TV/DVDs should not be used as alternatives to good parenting, the right ones can be helpful in distracting a child while said parent tries to get things done around the home.

Toshiro Mifune plays a rich industrialist distraught at his board of directors who want to make a shoddy product (shoes) for a bigger profit; he mortgages everything he owns to raise the money to buy the company and continue to make a top-quality shoe.     But then his son is kidnapped and a huge ransom demanded, only it turns out to be NOT his son who was kidnapped but the boy he was playing with at the time, his chauffeur's son. He's faced with a moral dilemma: should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially, or not? He decides to pay and get the boy back; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper.     At this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural. The kidnapper's motive for committing the crime is not just for the money but to make the rich suffer. Mifune is ruined at the end, but public support is behind him. It's a great crime drama; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit. What I found most fascinating was how differently the Japanese police handled the case from the way American police might - so much more compassionately. Definitely worth a watch",

I purchased season 1 and thought it was so-so but then as I started watching repeats of seasons 1 and 2, it dawned on me that this was one terrible show. I think the acting is poor (but that could be the fault of the scripts and/or the directors). Speaking of scripts, could the dialogue and scenes be any weaker? Invariably, on each show one of the agents will come into the scene and say \"I have a lead on the car (or phone number). I'm going to check it out.\" Exit scene.    I just can't believe that real FBI agents act like this quintet. LaPaglia's hair is long, then regulation, then long, then . . .well you get the idea. If there is an actress more sorry than Marianne Jean-Baptiste in a lead role, I have yet to meet her. Also, why are these two so argumentative with the relatives or friends of the missing person. I'm thinking especially of the father of the autistic boy who went missing in a museum. And if it is a husband or wife who went missing, then invariably the question is \"Was he (she) having an affair?\" and \"Are you having an affair?\"    Poppy Montgomery, an FBI agent? Come on. First, she has an affair with her supervisor (LaPaglia). Then she jumps into bed with one of her co-workers (Eric Close). Not in any FBI that I know.     At least Close and Enrique Murciano look and act like agents (and so does Montgomery, when she is out of bed) but they are handicapped by weak scripts and direction.

And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves \"ironic\", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays.  Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.",

If you're expecting the same power and intensity of \"Scooby Doo On Zombie Island\" or \"Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost,\" then you are setting yourself up for a disappointment. It is possible that certain powers felt that the first 2 Scooby movies were too much for children, but with this 3rd movie come a loss of impact, suspense, character development, and even mystery. It may be true that even a medocre Scooby movie is better than no Scooby movie at all, but this movie is almost boring after \"Zombie Island\" or \"Witch's Ghost.\" Well, Scooby and the gang have car trouble in a desert. Fred, Daphne, and Velmah go on foot for help while Scooby and Shaggy spot what may be an alien invasion. With their famous and hilarious cowardly ways, they run and eventually meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant. At the restaurant, the gang is surprised that the other patrons don't seem so surprised about the presence of aliens. We also meet Lester who appears eccentric but still aware of what has been going on in the area. Lester lets the gang stay the night, and Scooby and Shaggy have their first encounter with the possible 'aliens.' Moving on, Scooby and Shaggy meet Amber and Crystal, and are attracted to them. They later meet the mechanic Buck as well as a team of scientists (that we already have met). Unlike \"Zombie Island\" and \"Witch's Ghost,\" the misleads are not really well drawn. Also, rather than being surprised by the discovery of the villains, we are likely to be somewhat disappointed that it was so obvious. Even when we are presented with the most unusual character in this story (in this case it seems pointless to try to hide anything) it's nothing most people couldn't have figured out. I won't deny that there are some good moments in this movie. (For undoubtedly the first time, Scooby and Shaggy go to a restaurant and want nothing!)  But even the old episodes were usually better than this movie. Parents may not have to screen this movie, but it is  likely that even children will fall asleep during this one. Thank goodness for the eventual \"Legend of the Vampire\" and \"Aloha Scooby Doo.\"",

            "input": "so boring, it gets bored with itself . There are just two rules when you create a thriller with a pretty lead: 1) The lead (the delectable Ashley Judd) had better show some skin. 2) Thou shalt not be boring.    Twisted utterly fails on both counts.  Basically, Judd is Jessica Shepard, a messed up cop who specializes in hunting serial killers.  She's fond of bedding men she meets at late night bars, because she's self-destructive.  Only Jessica looks fabulous all the time, even when she's been on a bender (which is apparently every night).  How she maintains her good looks without stinking up the place is just another part of cinema magic.    Jessica is mentored by John Mills (Samuel L. Jackson).  For a second there I thought Jackson was going to play an understated version of his usual maniacal self.  I was wrong.    Things take a turn for the strange after Jessica discovers that every man she sleeps with is murdered.  And she keeps having these weird blackouts every night.  The victims wash up on the shore the next day with a single cigarette burn on their hand.  Poor Jessica is haunted by her parents' murder/suicide and wonders...since her father went on a mass-murdering spree before he killed himself, could she too have the \"serial killer gene\"?    Jessica is paired with Mike Delmarco (Andy Garcia), an Italian goomba who is alternately creepy, lecherous, and like everyone else in this ridiculous movie, wants to get into her pants.  Mike follows her around an awful lot...could HE be the killer?  Or maybe it's the ex-boyfriend cop, Jimmy Schmidt (Mark Pellegrino).  Or maybe it's...actually, I figured it out in the first ten minutes.    Being something of a true crime fan, and having read a bit on the subject, this entire premise is absurd. You don't wake up one day and become a serial killer; if anyone actually got a good look at the life of a serial killer, it screams DANGER from day one.  Pretty Jessica has none of those problems in her past, except for a vague \"suppressed rage\" that manifests itself in kinky sex and kicking people in the face.  Her cherubic face shows no signs of hardship, and neither does the rest of her. Although the script wants us to believe she's a haggard cop, the camera is only too happy to zoom in on her rear end.  Not once, but twice.  And it's not a naked rear end either.    So we have a gorgeous female cop who sleeps around, yet there are very few bedroom scenes.  We have a serial killer plot that is connected by red herrings (Who is that lady across the street?  Why does Jessica fiddle with a cigarette but never light it?).  On one hand, the cops are strictly by the book; they make a big deal out of the fact that Jessica kicks a serial killer in the face.  On the other hand, nobody pulls Jessica off the case when she's a prime suspect, nor watch her home when the serial killer is obviously following her around.     Neither sleazy or highbrow, gritty or moralistic, Twisted is so boring, it gets bored with itself",

            "input": "A timeless masterpiece on universal themes . Imagine you found out you were going to die in a few months. What would you do? What would you decide mattered to you? What would you think you had accomplished? What would you consider left unaccomplished? What would you want your legacy to be?    Those are the questions facing the centeral character in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (meaning \"To live\"). The brilliant actor Takashi Shimura plays the role of Kanji Watanabe, a midlevel bureaucrat who has spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job by looking busy while actually accomplishing little. One day this man learns he has terminal cancer and will soon die. This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile. He tries to \"live it up\" with newfound friends and loose women, but this does not fulfill him. He cannot bring himself to tell his own son and daughter-in-law about his fate; caught up in their own petty problems, they seem to have little time for the old man. Eventually he meet a kind of kindred spirit, another worker at the bureaucracy who is quitting her job because she too feels she is doing nothing useful. But even she cannot help this poor man who needs love, fulfillment, a sense of purpose. And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward. After he dies the glory all goes to lesser bureaucrats who, while previously fighting him every step of the way, now bask in the spotlight and claim the glory, paying him much lip service while denying him true honor.    Normally I don't give so detailed a plot description, but I've done so here for two reasons: 1) few people, particularly in America, have seen or even heard of this movie, and 2) I want to point out how universal the themes are, how this movie could easily be remade today in any other country with any other culture and any other cast. While watching Ikiru I kept thinking a good modern title might be, \"The More Things Change The More They Stay The Same.\" Like so many Kurosawa films, this movie, though black and white and old, feels completely contemporary in its concerns and its content. While much has been made of Kurosawa's concern with the Japanese conflict between collective and individual, the issues in Ikiru resonates with any culture, not just Japan's. These bureacrats sound like the bureaucrats with which we all are familiar. This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle. It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life. At the same time, it never feels pretentious or preachy.    The story is complex, not in terms of plot twists, but in terms of its \"inner life.\" Yet with a running time of two hours and 23 minutes, Ikiru moves very quickly, feeling faster than a typical 90-minute Hollywood film. This is probably because there is lots of ground to cover, and also because of the effortless acting. Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema. Though Shimura is not widely known in the west, he was one of Japan's major actors of the 1950s and 60s, and Kurosawa worked with him often. See him in Kurosawa's Seven Samuri, made just two years after this film, for a completely different performance, one of swagger and bravado.     Other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker. She too feels straitjacketed by her job as a government paper-pusher, but she is young and not tied down by responsibility and so she leaves. On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is \"The Mummy.\" Rather than be offended, he agrees with her and this insight helps to shape his vision of himself and what he must do to be redeemed.    It's hard to believe the same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this. Yet the film, or the third act of it, also reminded me of a very different motion picture--Citizen Kane, believe it or not. While stylistically the two masterpieces have little in common, both deal with a man, recently dead, who is being pieced together by those who knew him partially. They try to make sense of his actions without ever getting the full picture, while we, as the omniscent audience, do. They misunderstand his actions, and ascribe many to selfishness when they were actually exactly the opposite. (Often with Kane the reverse is true.) The only difference is while Watanabe is fundamentally a sympathetic character, Kane is not. Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces.    Ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or \"Mr. K,\" as he was called by many). Katayama was the head of Nissan Motor's West Coast division in North America in the 1960s and 70s. He was brought to the task when Nissan was a piddly carmaker of no consequence, especially in North America, which was then ruled by big, powerful Ford and GM cars. Though Katayama was not motivated by the thought of his impending death, he was hard-working and wanted to succeed in America, which he did through steady, unflagging determination. But he also went against the grain of Japanese business protocol, and encountered the wrath of his superiors in Tokyo. Ironically, the more successful he became, the more he was resented. (His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.) After establishing Nissan as a major player in America, Katayama was unceremoniously retired as superiors moved in and took credit for his work. He died in obscurity, but today Mr. K is a revered figure at Nissan, and was even used in an advertising campaign several years ago. Executives now dislocate their jaws praising him. It all sounds too familiar.    The second DVD has two features, a 90 minute documentary from Kurosawa's own production company about his working methods, wherein he discusses everything from writing scripts to editing the final product; and a 40-minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews.  Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them.  There's also the film's trailer and a commentary track which I confess I haven't had time to listen to.  It's by Stephen Prince, author of The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa.    Criterion once again is the standard to which all DVD makers should be aspiring. The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see. It's unfortunate that for many years Kurosawa's work was not better taken care of. Like Nissan's Mr. K, he was without honor in his own country, because he was considered \"too Western\" in his outlook. Like Mr. K, his name now evokes nothing but praise in his homeland. Fortunately, the work of this \"Mr. K\" is finally being preserved. Ikiru is a film you should investigate even if you've never seen a Japanese movie before, even if you've never heard of Akira Kurosawa, even if you \"hate\" foreign or black and white films, even if you think you have no interest in the subject. Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story. Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term \"timeless classic.",

I really like a lot of the exercises- particularly the 'bow and arrow'.

Janis Saffel has 'cute California charm'- some people like this, some don't.  Some things I don't like about this workout are a) the music includes elevator music of familiar songs- such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stevie Wonder; b) she shifts her angle a good bit and does several exercises in quick succession at times (warm up, etc.).  I find the and speed increases the risk of having poor alignment so I focus on keeping feet facing forward so the exercise is properly done- not rushed and poorly aligned.  I'm sure if you're familiar with these exercises this is not a problem; c) some floor stretches and ab work take the place of a cool down section.

If you're a fan of Trane, and even just luke-warm on Branford, I'm confident you'll find this to be a very worthwhile purchase.       Competent but lesser musicians playing ALS would try to channel Trane and the classic quartet.  Not Branford.  He is a mature artist with a fully-realized style.  He sometimes lovingly quotes Trane, or puts his own spin on a Trane riff, but he is clearly his own man on this recording of A Love Supreme.      Jeff Tain Watts understands the essence of Elvin and Elvin's contribution to ALS.  But, like Branford, Tain is his own man here.  He's great as a sideman, and plays a great solo at the end of Resolution.      Joey Calderazzo - an outstanding pianist who has done excellent and original work with many of today's top jazz artists - falls into McCoy mode in his first solo, but then plays like himself in his second one.  Both are great solos, but I think it shows a real maturity and confidence to be yourself rather than emulate the masters when playing their great works.     The bassist, Eric Revis, is very good, but I'm partial to Robert Hurst's performance on Branford's earlier recording of ALS.       It's worth comparing that earlier performance to the new one.  Branford first recorded ALS ten years ago for a CD compilation called \"Stolen Moments:  Red, Hot & Blue\".  That version is much shorter - only about 25 minutes, compared to the full-length version on the new DVD/CD combo.  On the older version, Branford's quartet went into the studio, didn't rehearse much (they were all fine musicians and all knew ALS), and started the tape rolling.  It is a wonderful performance, and well-worth having in your collection.  But it sounds like they are not trying to record anything original, just to have a fun time playing Trane's music.  (Be warned, though, that most of that CD contains acid jazz & hip hop.)     In contrast, the new recording does have a bit more of Branford's personality and interpretation.  For example, the chord changes in Acknowledgement are clearly different than on Trane's original recording - not so different to be annoying or trite - but different enough to let you know that Branford has something new to say.  Plus, in the 10 years since the earlier recording, Branford has grown from a very good but young musician to a true master in his own right, and this is evident on the new recording.        The sound & picture quality are PHENOMENAL.  I have about a dozen concert DVDs covering various genres.  This is easily the best sounding & looking of them all.  My TV/DVD player is plugged into a mere bookshelf stereo (albeit a good one), and the sound was SUPERB.  Then, I took the DVD over to a friend's house who has Dolby 5.1 home theater sound, and my God, I thought I was in the club with the musicians!   The picture quality matches the sound quality.  I viewed this DVD on a high-definition wide screen TV, and it was really quite thrilling.      The DVD includes a bunch of interviews.  First is a 30-minute interview between Branford and Alice Coltrane.  She talks a lot about Trane, his music, his relentless pursuit of perfection, some reminiscing about when he wrote ALS, and she and Branford have interesting exchanges about the nature of jazz and other topics.  Then there are a bunch of shorter interviews on various aspects of ALS, including some with Michael Brecker.  I think the interviews are insightful and add value to an already great disc.      Finally, there's a brief segment called \"Branford Casual\" that shows Branford walking around town, working out at the gym, practicing some classical music on the soprano, rehearsing with his quartet, and misc backstage tour footage.  Neat, but not essential.     Amazingly, you get all this for the price of a CD.  And the package includes an audio CD of the concert performance as a bonus!",

Pick up most any hit record beginning in the late 1940s, especially any recording done with Atlantic Records, and you will likely see that one Tom Dowd was the producer or recording engineer. In this loving tribute to Dowd, who died October 27, 2002 before the film was finished, those inside the guild honor the memory of one whom they universally acknowledge was a legendary genius and wonderful human being. In his younger years Dowd was a physics student at Columbia, and even worked on the atom bomb project (he was present at the Bikini Atoll tests), but his mother was an opera singer and perhaps he was destined for music. Dowd was a master technical innovator, musical aesthete, coach, father figure, and psychologist. He himself narrates most of the film, but we are also treated to original concert footage (Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, etc.) and retrospective interviews with a number of the stars whose sounds he perfected, including Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, and Greg Allman. The five minutes or so when Dowd sits at a console and walks us through the thirty-year-old master copy of \"Layla,\" starting with only the guitars and then adding the various parts until they pulse with that incredibly evocative sound that defined an era, interspersed with poignant reflections by Clapton, are worth the entire film. One disappoint in this otherwise fascinating glimpse of the history of music recording since the late 1940s is that we learn nothing at all personal about Dowd, and nothing at all about any weaknesses, failures, misjudgments, and the like, that would have made this entirely likable person even more richly human",

This is your standard, generic, run-of-the mill comedy, with Ben Stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc. and Jennifer Anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible.  Stiller marries some woman, they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon, he catches her having sex with some guy, and he goes back to New York depressed.  Then he meets Polly, and they have absolutely nothing in common.  They go through the usual problems (yawn), then at the end they sort of get together, I guess.    If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, I mean, if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious, then you may find this amusing.  Truthfully, it's a lousy, unfunny script, these people have absolutely no comedic sense, and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie where you're sitting there thinking, \"oh, that was supposed to be funny\", and not laughing.  Do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor, even though he obviously didn't slip or anything?  Do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really, REALLY thick accent so you can barely understand him?

I have my doubts as to Santana' music for quiet a long time- it seems that he loves his place and role as a rock icon too much and forgot to do music. Let me be more specific- I never liked his salsa last records and thought that this is no music. For a guitar player who invented new ideas and streams in the rock guitar-playing world, these records were an insult- no less. I am really sure that Santana himself admits- deep down in his heart- that he looks for better music. It can be that these guilt feelings brought him to \"create\" this DVD. Well, if I am right in my analysis, he did wrong in his music, again. Nothing connects Santana to the blues and he will not convince (at least me) that he was raised on the knees of the blues. C'mon, forty years of career and now he revels that he is rooted in the blues??  Sorry, I don't buy it. Now, as Santana is not a blues guitar player, and never was- this DVD cannot be good and there are a lot of reasons for it: Santana' playing the blues is loud and vulgar while all other three guitar players (Bobby Parker, Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown and Buddy Guy) have a small and unique sound, Santana' technique (which was always amazing) covers a lack of touch and feeling while all three base their playing on feeling, emotion and the right sound- Santana, on the other hand, covers his disadvantages in playing the blues with all lot of notes. Now, if you want to purchase good blues guitar playing DVD go for each of the three (meaning: Bobby Parker, Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown and Buddy Guy) for their own records. If you like Santana (past or present) go for his own but, don't mix between them as Santana did. One more thing- Santana relates to Jeff Beck in his words added to this DVD and I agree that this is a good example- anyone who wants to understand the meaning of the blues and rock/blues guitar should address to Jeff Beck, not to Santana whom we still expect, after so many years, to create real music.",

This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played.     \"Eight Women\" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. \"Eight Women\" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.    Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.    By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience.",

The movie was filmed in Kern County- specifically Bakersfield, California. Nowhere in the movie does it imply that it is Texas, and in fact locals will recognize many landmarks from the 70's, including I think it is 19th Street with the Hub (where we all bought western clothing and boots), the pawn shops, and the porn shops. The turn-off where Bobby gets caught up playing a piano on the back of the pick-up truck is to Shafter, CA, one of the small dust-bowl era farm towns in Kern County. The bowling alley was Freddy's Top of the Hill on Union Avenue, where we all went bowling in high school. Bobby works not in the Texas oilfields, but in the oilfields, now for the most part non-producing (although the oil supposedly is still there, just being held for economic reasons), that are located out near Taft. Now that that is cleared up- the movie itself is incredible and in my opinion Nicholsons' best and most raw acting, without the goofy cliche crazy Nicholson schtick that characterizes his later work. His scene with his father before he leaves is pure, open, painful emotion- and one of the best performances on-screen of any actor, ever",

Francisco Serpico was an honest Italian cop - courageously honest.  When he saw widespread corruption among New York Cops everywhere he was offered the opportunity to participate in the payoffs that the police were receiving left and right.  Initially, Serpico simply abstained.  The corrupt cops became of suspicious of Serpico - at one point in the film he is told \"who can trust a cop who won't take a payoff?\"  Because of his dedication to honest police work and a burning desire to \"do the right thing\" Serpico goes from a non-participant in the graft to actively fighting it.  He is understandably frustrated over and over when his reports to the police authorities are met with not much more than \"you're doing a good job, Frank, keep up the good work and we'll reach out for you when the time is right\".  The right time never arrives and Serpico, prodded by his friend Bob Blair (played by Tony Roberts), brings his complaints outside of the department - first to the Mayor's office, then finally to the New York Times.     Serpico is treated by his fellow police officers initially as an eccentric goody-goody, then later subjected to death threats.  The film is bookended by a sequence in Serpico's life when he is transferred to a narcotics division then probably set-up for assassination.  The point-blank bullet that Serpico's partners lead him into doesn't kill him and Frank is alive today, lecturing at police academies and for organizations interested in having a \"lamp lighter\" - giving support to those who have the inclination, but perhaps not the courage, to speak up about things that are plain wrong.    Now, thinking about the film later, I wonder what was going on in the minds of the other policemen.  Presumably, many of them didn't WANT to be crooked cops.  Certainly the \"extra\" money that they received was tempting - perhaps they looked at those extra dollars as compensation for what was not a lot of pay in a dangerous profession.      Serpico is one of the most visible examples of someone \"doing the right thing\" against incredible odds, even as his life was threatened.  This is a good story that needs to be told and Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino tell it well",

            "input": "A taboo subject handled superbly by Malle . Louis Malle's sensitive and delicate look at sexual initiation. Set in 1954, Benoit Ferreux plays a 14-year-old boy from Dijon; his father is a cold, uncaring gynecologist; his mother (played brilliantly by Lea Massari) is a free spirit. He contracts scarlet fever, which cause a heart murmur, and goes with his mother for a cure to a hotel/spa. He meets some girls there, and Massari openly sees a lover; she doesn't hide anything about this from him - in fact, she openly solicits his sympathies when she leaves her lover rather than go off with him. Massari's and Ferreux's closeness is gradually developed until they go to bed together. This act of incest is a special moment for both, and Malle must be praised for not exploiting it or making it sordid. Massari, as I said, is excellent, and it's not an easy role to play. The movie is both a commentary on the vapidness of the French bourgeoisie and an affirmation of life on a personal level. There is also a great Charlie Parker musical score. A wonderful movie all around",

            "input": "&quot;To fight fascism you have to be a communist.&quot; . One of the most notorious espionage stories of the 20th century involves several members of Britain's upper crust. While Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, and Donald MacLean attended Trinity College, Cambridge, in the 1930s, they were recruited as spies by the Soviet government. All of the men subsequently gained prestigious jobs and successfully passed secrets to the Russians for several decades. The four-hour television mini-series, &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, concentrates on the characters of the spies, and how the society they were part of allowed them to flourish.       The film begins with Trinity College, Cambridge in the 1930s. Hitler's power is on the rise, and fascism manages to impress a certain segment of the British upper classes. In response to the rise of fascism, many are attracted to communism. Blunt and Burgess are members of an elite club--the Apostles--and they are both committed communists when they meet and become involved with Donald MacLean and Kim Philby. The four men form a tight bond, which remains even after they leave university. Philby and Burgess both held high positions in MI6, and MacLean became a diplomat. Blunt--a distant relative to the royals--was knighted and became the Royal Curator of Art for the Queen.       &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; succeeds in showing how these men were attracted to communism in the first place. They all came from wealthy, privileged backgrounds, and involvement with communism was a reaction against that, and also a reaction against fascism. The film shows the political and social atmosphere in which the &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; made their commitment to communism. The film is also extremely successful in showing the 'old boy network' that existed, and which, in effect managed to protect the spies. They were simply beyond suspicion and beyond reproach.      Guy Burgess (Tom Hollander in an amazing performance) is a volatile extrovert with a penchant for self-destruction. Kim Philby (Toby Stephens) is much more controlled, and he seems the more rational of the bunch. MacLean (Rupert Penry-Jones) is another loose cannon, and Blunt (Samuel West) enjoys his connection with his royal relatives far more than he anticipated. While I deplored the misguided actions of the spies, it seems quite plausible that at least two of the four men (Blunt and Burgess) lived to really regret their youthful decision to convert to communism. But they found themselves stuck in a lifetime commitment before they realised the consequences. Blunt and Burgess seemed to truly love England, and their involvement with the Soviet government is sadly ironic.      &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; is really is an incredible story. The plot sticks more or less to the truth--although some details are not quite accurate. The most glaring deviation concerns the defection of Guy Burgess. DVD extras include a documentary, and there's also a 'scrapbook' with TV tidbits about each of the spies--displacedhuman",

            "input": "The first of the truly great seasons of Seinfeld . After two somewhat experimental seasons, Seinfeld really began hitting its stride in this third season. It's really a tribute to the talent that was in front of and behind the cameras on this show that they tweaked the formula for two seasons until near perfect comedy and chemistry was achieved.     In \"The Library\" we see how the writers make everything come full circle in this show. One of the best one-episode characters in Seinfeld's history, the Library Detective is an hilariously stubborn old fashioned man who confronts Jerry about a missing book from 1971 that was never returned. Jerry goes to see his girlfriend at the time to see if he returned the book, only to find that he had not. Meanwhile, Kramer meets a pretty librarian and George sees his brown toothed underwear pulling gym teacher, who now is a bum living under the steps of the NYC Public Library. The old man hasn't changed much, and he gives George yet another wedgie.  Also, the library book turned out not to be just a red herring, as it turns out the homeless gym teacher has hung onto it all these years.    \"The Red Dot\" is a hilarious example of how George cannot just leave well enough alone - he always has to push everything to its limits. Elaine gets the long out-of-work George a job at the publishing company for which she works. Everything would be back on track for George, but he just can't resist having sex in the office with the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady takes the encounter more seriously than George does, and George is afraid she'll tell his boss of the encounter and get him fired. He decides to give her a gift, a cashmere sweater that has been deeply discounted because of a tiny red dot on it that is supposedly too small to see yet each of its recipients spot it almost immediately, including the cleaning lady. She informs on George, and he is out of work once again.     The season finale, \"The Keys\", sets up the Emmy winning fourth season. Kramer has been abusing his house priveleges in Jerry's apartment too much, so Jerry revokes his spare key privileges. Realizing that he has broken the \"covenant of the keys\" gives Kramer the realization he is now free to break out of his routine. Kramer takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor. Jerry gave his spare keys to Elaine, then when he needs them, he goes with George to Elaine's to search for his spare set, since George has Elaine's spare keys. What they find is Elaine's show-biz project, an episode of Murphy Brown that she has written. Elaine finds the two going through her stuff and in turn revokes George's spare key priveleges. Kramer finds adventure as he journeys across the country to LA where he gets a bit part on Murphy Brown playing her secretary. The next season picks up on the gang trying to locate Kramer in California.    I highly recommend this season as the first season of Seinfeld where everything seems to be clicking both storywise and character-wise. It's not a show where you need any background from previous seasons, since, after all, it is \"a show about nothing\". However, I found it helpful to view the first two seasons first to see how everything came together",

The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun.

I was also amazed how 2Pac's many interviews and recordings were seemlessly pieced together to make it sound as if Tupac himself was narrating his own documentary.  Although it is a bit eerie at first listening to a dead man narrate his own life (and death), it is a much more involving and incredible experience with 2Pac's narration.      Tupac lived an amazing life, even if it was tragically cut short.  Tupac Resurrection, then, is a movie that can be appreciated even by people who are not fans of Tupac or rap in general.  I watched this movie with my brother, who is absolutely not a fan of rap at all, and even he enjoyed the movie.  It is just that 2Pac was such a charismatic, intelligent, and poetic man that he is just fascinating to listen to.  And, this movie is doubly fascinating listening to a man narrate his entire life, from birth to death.    If you are a fan of 2Pac, this is a must-have.  As I said before, after watching \"Tupac Resurrection\" I gained an even greater appreiciation of his music.  Even for those that aren't fans of Tupac or even rap in general, I highly recommend this movie because it is simply an intense story about a man that is birthed into this world with nothing, becomes rich from an intense dedication to his artistic medium, and then dies a tragic, early death.    The only thing I have left to do is quote Roger Ebert's review, because I really believe he hits the nail right on the head when he says, \"Let's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music, but might have it in you to see one. This is the one.\"  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Rap fans or not.  Tupac fans or not",

He was as about as convincing as a special effect in a cheesy 50's science fiction movie. If you want to see the best version of the story, watch Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. If you want originality, either watch Ichabod and Mr. Toad or read the original story",

For various reasons it remains for me the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis, immortalized in Guy Clark's \"LA Freeway.\" I wish David Allen Coe had been left out, but no film is perfect.   The songwriters are shown at their best and worst:  a drunken,  funny TVZ falls into a rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics.      This movie was made when I was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just a little.   I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me.   When TVZ sang 'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical. TVZ does a \"medley of my hit\" and sings \"Pancho and Lefty,\" and Rodney Crowell sang \"Bluebird Wine,\" both covered by Emmylou. Steve Young's \"Alabama Highways\" was wonderful too. It was a look into my past -  and the past and future of the intelligent, emotional music I love best.",

However, I can't think of any which have come after that I wanted to see twice---not \"Up the Down Staircase\" or \"Dangerous Minds\" or the one about the calculus teacher or the one about Principal Joe Clark or the one with Jim Belushi or the one with Tom Berenger as the substitute or even the recent one with Hillary Swank, which was pretty good once it got going. \"To Sir With Love\" is the standout in a very large group. It had cast chemistry and charm and sweetness and an offbeat innocence. And we still need \"life skills\" classes as mandatory offerings in American high schools, an idea that this film was, I believe, the first to champion, despite its being set in Great Britain",

This \"Let's Start\", and then \"Stop\", \"Start again\" cycle of this film presents as a messy, disorganized glance at Ms. Sedgwick's disturbing life.     Another 'tragedy \" exists here. Our educated culture should recognize that if Edie weren't exceptionally beautiful, there wouldn't have been much fuss over an ancestor of a historically noted family.     Beauty still takes precedence over most other attributes.   It's been over 35 years since the death of Edie Sedgwick, but the \"glam-famishished\" still won't let the beauty get her rest.     The film's black and white scenes show the brilliance of Edie's past beauty, but are all cut and pasted into a confusing,tangled decoupage.     The additional color footage of the next decade is woven in carelessly.  If it was just Edie's glowing wedding sequence that were included,it would've been much easier to watch.      The \"two teenagers\" who appear in the  the colored segments seem out of time with Edie's Glory Days of the 60's.

Unfortunately, that is where the good ends.    Bruce Feiler sets out on a quest to visit all the biblical landmarks of its first five books, but the trip has an inherent weakness - Mr. Feiler is a skeptic. He is taking a journey of faith but rationalizes each and every step he takes. For example, ascending the Mt. Ararat, where the Bible says the Ark of Noah rested; he wonders where all the waters would have come from in the first place. He wonders - melting ice-caps? In other words, Bruce Feiler is looking for a rational explanation for the Great Flood!     If Bruce Feiler believes that there was a garden of Eden as the Bible says (his very first stop), then he must also believe that God made the heavens and the earth, as the Bible says! If HE can create the Heavens and the Earth by the Word of HIS mouth, HE can also perform miracles. You cannot pick and choose what you believe based on your so-called rationality - either the Bible is true in its entirety, or it is not. If it is not true, then it does not need Bruce Feiler's help to prop up its so-called \"stories\".     This aspect of Bruce Feiler journey is oft repeated - and very perplexing.  Why set out on such a journey if you do not believe your Guidebook? More examples? Bruce Feiler suggest that since the Sinai wilderness could not support the number of people the Bible says crossed over from Egypt, therefore the numbers must be wrong. How about the Manna being nothing but the gum of some wilderness tree in Sinai? I could go on....but you get the point. After a while, this becomes very annoying.

I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?

            "input": "Too much . After watching this film I decided to be scientific and use the process of elimination to determine how someone might have been able to appreciate it since I hadn't.  Aesthetics is, after all, a subjective experience, so a little objective rigor brought to bear on enjoyable experiences others might have had watching this movie should theoretically enable me to expand my own repertoire of aesthetic responses.     The first way one could not have found enjoyment watching this film is by being seduced by the exotic locales.  Yes, there was a pan that lasted for about a minute of a pretty Czech village, but otherwise the Newtonian law of cinematics has once again been confirmed, and here's the proof:  In the Bollywood movie, Humtum, a scene that was meant to occur in Paris was filmed on the Museumplein in Amsterdam; so the equal and opposite gaffe was bound to be committed somewhere.  In Hostel, scenes meant to occur in Amsterdam have been filmed (jarringly) in Prague.  And just like they did with the Americans in Borat, I can imagine (in the cynical frame of mind this movie put me in) the filmmakers telling European colleagues and extras, \"Don't worry, it doesn't matter - we'll never show this in your country.\" Well, it eventually mattered to the fratboy who wanted to bring slavery back, and it should have mattered to the filmmakers. QED.    After also eliminating direction, script, and acting as potential means for appreciating this movie I started to worry.  Yes, much thought had obviously gone into making this thing; but the Dusk-To-Dawn pleasure/pain structure and obscure references didn't mesh well with the low-budget sinister spin on European Vacation.  Worse, the unfortunate juxtaposition of beautiful naked flesh and extreme torture in this film exerts a pernicious influence on the psyche of the viewer - surely that couldn't have been intended.  And then, like being shot by a diamond bullet right through my forehead, it became clear that I'd completely missed the point.  This is a message film, and I'd been stupid not to pick up on the movie's lofty ambitions.      The next challenge was to decipher the message, and I tell you this is the part that took the most time.  At first I suspected a sort of buried agenda to keep Americans from traveling outside their country.  The lesson seemed so clear that sublimely beautiful European temptresses want our dollars, but they will 1) mock us at every opportunity for not being cool in an effeminate, European way, 2) shield their true intentions by brazenly conspiring against us to our face in their unfamiliar native tongues, 3) have an almost psychic rapport with thuggish male fellow-countrymen who intend to punish us for having both the motive (wanting to have sex with beautiful girls) and opportunity (lots of aforesaid dollars and girls with loose morals) to steal their women, 4) ultimately sell us over to be tortured because they'll do anything for money (those loose morals again), and 5) succeed in their nefarious plan because the rule of law ends at the US border.    But this interpretation sounded paranoid when I played it back, and I suspected the ultra-violence of the movie had once again influenced my state of mind.  What if this do-not-leave-the-US message was really the unintentional result of some other process at work in the filmmakers' master plan?  So I started listening to the commentary track for more insight, but it was really irritating and I couldn't listen to the whole thing.  They've apparently re-coined the expression, `bully', which must be a sort of Teddy Roosevelt macho thing.    Their country's recent actions around the world have made many Americans feel self-conscious and unloved abroad.  It's unrealistic to think all the issues caused by this will be resolved so soon after the trauma.  Americans have a very pronounced sense of national identity, and we should expect some confused, troubled people doing things that might not make immediate sense while they work things out for themselves.    Also; paying women for sex has a long history, and I wouldn't think to question its place in society.  However, like all those things we're taught from childhood are wrong, paying for sex sets off a complex chain reaction of deep, conflicting emotions.  It's not always pretty to see these emotions being worked through, and unintentionally choosing film as the medium to do this was probably a mistake.    Having exhausted all other reasonable avenues, I've come to the scientific conclusion that the only way to appreciate this movie is to share the sensibilities, sensitivities, and neuroses of the filmmakers; and I find these to be distasteful.  This film helps to mark a key boundary of aesthetic territory, and like the man said: \"you never know what's enough until you know what's too much.\"",

Starring Wannell himself, his character Adam wakes in a bathtub in a room with no lights. He calls out for help and hears a strangers voice, the lights come on revealing the two chained and shackled in a grimy, abandoned, windowless industrial bathroom. And so the game begins... The two prisoners are victims of serial killer Jigsaw, well he really isn't a serial killer as we find out. He puts his victims through a dangerous game to test their will to live, and its up to the victim if they live of die.  This movie is one hell of a rollercoaster ride which will appeal to fans of both horror and psychological thrillers. It was voted one of the most scary films of all time, and while I didn't find it too scary, its the reality that these crimes could happen to anyone that is most frightening.   Filmed in only 18 days, most of it filmed in a warehouse, this is quality filmaking by a young up-and-comer.

DVD 1, on the Spartans (essentially leading up to Thermopylae) is good. However, DVD 2 is very disappointing. First of all, it has three documentaires, but in fact the first one (\"The Odyssey of Troy\") and the third one (\"The Trojan City\") are carbon copies of each other, which is somewhat of a fraud... Second, the information given by the historians is good, but the narrative itself is more than misleading -- it leaves the viewer with the impression that the Trojan Horse epic is part of Homer's Iliad. It isn't. Homer finishes the Iliad with the burial of Hector. It is in a \"sequel\" so to say, by Quintus of Smyrna, written many centuries later, that the story of the Trojan Horse is set down. It is also mentioned in other less complete writings, but certainly not in Homer.   To be fair, the second documentary in DVD 2 (\"The Ancient Gold of Troy\") is not bad, but does not correct the errors in the other \"two\" segements",

            "input": "emotionally and dramatically flat and lifeless; set decoration is the only lively thing on display . Roland Joffe directed two masterpieces: The Killing Fields & The Mission. But those two films, directed in 1984 & 1986, were made twenty or more years ago. I'd recommend either of those two films to anybody but Vatel I would recommend only to those viewers who can enjoy a film for its look, its set design and its attention to period detail even when the story and characters themselves are not all that captivating.     Vatel is a film that should have everything going for it. As mentioned the director has at least two masterpieces to his credit, Tom Stoppard had a hand in the screenplay (more on that in a minute), Uma Thurman is beautiful, and Gerard Depardieu & Julian Sands & Tim Roth are each capable of delivering memorable performances when they feel inspired. The problem is no one feels inspired by this material. And that is in part due to a lackluster set of characters--supposedly based on actual people--and a story that never really manages to capture our imagination.    Gerard Depardieu as master steward \"Vatel\" is required by his boss, the gout-stricken Prince Conde aka General Conde, to arrange elaborate feasts and entertainments for a visiting retinue of royals that include King Louis XIV, his mistresses, his brother, and various advisors & handlers. If these feasts and entertainments succeed in capturing the kings fancy then Vatel's boss may receive the honor of commanding the French troops in a war with Holland (that may or may not happen). So virtually every frame of the film is dedicated to following Vatel as he personally oversees virtually every dish and set decoration before it is presented to the royal retinue. As viewers we are amazed by Vatel's ingenuity with everything from outdoor theatrical sets that resemble large fold-out books to his ability to make delicate lanterns out of vegetable gourds (Martha Stewart would be impressed) but our interest is purely aesthetic because we never really care whether the Prince gets his royal comission or not and we barely care about Vatel. Next to the selfish, scheming and utterly corrupt royals the selfless and earthy and incorruptible Vatel seems, well, selfless and earthy and incorruptible. Along with his many domestic and artistic talents Vatel also has an uncanny way of understanding people's true natures and needs better than they. The problem with Vatel is that he is perhaps too selfless and so while he busies himself with entertaining others his own life is virtually a non-event.     Uma Thurman plays a woman of precarious social standing. She is from a noble family but her position at court is not yet secure and like everyone else she must humor the King to assure his continued favor. When he suggests that they meet in private \"for a cup of chocolate\" she has no choice but to agree. She is under no illusion that she is anything but a temporary amusement for the King but to refuse the King's advances would be social suicide. The royal world sickens her and we are supposed to see her as somehow too earthy and real for court life but one problem is that this character is barely there. Uma just barely goes through the motions when she is onscreen; instead of seeming like she is dissatisfied with court life she just looks like she is dissatisfied with having to be in this royal dud of a picture. This is too bad because she is supposed to be the muse that awakens or re-awakens Vatel's long dormant passions but there is absolutely zero spark between Uma Thurman and Gerard Depardieu. When the obese fifty-something Depardieu kisses the thirty-something Uma we just don't get it. Few screen romances have ever felt so unconvincing and so void of passion and so uncomfortable to watch. We do know that Depardieu as Vatel is capable of feeling affection because he is very fond of his pet parrots but alas none of this affection is apparent when Uma Thurman is in frame. We're supposed to feel that its the rabid social competition of court life that reduces love to a mere game of conquest and that true love in such a world doesn't have a chance. Instead what we feel is that lack of chemistry between actors is what kills passion.  Since the Depardieu-Thurman romance doesn't manage to throw off even one spark the primary story-line is D.O.A. . The elaborate theatrical productions and fireworks displays might hold your attention for a few minutes but this film is not interesting enough to hold your attention for two hours.     Julian Sands does a pretty good job as King Louis XIV and Tim Roth an ok job as one of the kings advisors but neither of these actors are given anything very interesting to do or say. Though Tom Stoppard's name appears in the credits when you look closer you realize that Tom Stoppard didn't write an original screenplay rather he merely adapted a French text. Thus even though this film tries to ride on the coat tails of the Stoppard penned Shakespeare in Love this production does not have any of Stoppard's signature cleverness or wit.",

And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed? Please, give me a break.",

Into The Blue has Great Acting, Good Directing, Great Special Effects, and Good Writing. Let me start off with saying I definitely prefer Paul Walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves I'm right. The Acting in this film has got to be its strongest point Jessica Alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and Paul Walker does a great job as well. Scoot Cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk! The Special Effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff. The Writing and Directing were also very good but I believe the Acting stood out the most.    Overall if you like Jessica Alba or Paul Walker or Underwater Adventures You'll love this movi",

I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake...    First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too.    Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film.    Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior.    The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age.    The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone.    1-star...please don't waste 103 minutes of your life on this film",

A sailor on a fishing trawler spots a human body in the water. After retrieving it we find it is alive. Helping this stranger back from the near dead we find a couple of bullet holes and a mysterious capsule under his skin.

Down Periscope is proof that you don't need fancy special effects or a giant budget to make a fun movie. My teenagers loved it, setting it up on the same shelf with zoolander and super-troopers.    Kelsey Grammer does a wonderful job and seems to relish his role, playing it with the controlled fun that is the hallmark of the movie. Known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub (an old rusty diesel boat) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern Navy. Fortunately Grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone.     The crew consists of stereotypes, from the flatulant cook, to the grizzled old veteran, to the spoiled son of an admiral, to the basketball star, to the spit-and-polish XO, but the actors manage to bring them off with charm, especially the electrician who Grammer notes has \"absorbed a lot of voltage\". In addition to the big laughs, there are the little scenes that bring a smile, such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to \"see if the other rooms are still tilted\"    Ultimately it is a feel-good movie. It doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts, but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch!    Of special note, San Franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the \"mothball fleet\" in Suisun Bay and the docked sub shots of the \"Stingray\" are the USS Pampanito, a sub open for tours at Pier 39 - you can even see the other piers at the end.",

Jet has one oustanding action sequence but other than that, he just isn't used.      Jacky Cheung is the star of this movie and plays an actor who absolutely never uses stunt doubles.  It became apparent within 5 minutes that this movie was made to make fun of Jackie Chan.  Of course it didn't have to be so obvious but Jing Wong just keeps driving it into your head that he does his own stunts.  So if you are familiar with Jing then you know this isn't going to be a tribute to Jackie.  Oh no, it is a punch to the throat through the movie screen.  Jet Li plays Cheung's bodyguard and ends up doing the a stunt for him.  After setting up his stupid Jackie Chan character, Jing tries to do a remake of Die Hard.  Remember how you never knew what Bruce Willis was going to do and it was always surprising?  Well Jing makes about the worst movie possible from here on.  Instead of being clever, he makes Jet just keep storming in on the hostages and then flee.  At one point he takes a helicopter up and starts shooting right into the buiding at the main bad guy with all of the hostages standing around.  After the helicopter crashes into the side of the building it doesn't blow up, it just destroys everything on that floor.  So other than one outstanding action sequence between Jet Li and Ben Lam(guy with sunglasses), this movie is a complete waste of time.  Even Billy Chow couldn't save this one.  Of course it would help if Wong Jing was smart enough to capitalize on the success of Billy Chow and Jet Li in 'Fist of Legend', but instead we don't get to see them fight and get to look at Billy Chow in a thong.  Yeah, that it just what I am looking for.      The Universal Laser and Video company version is OK but the imbedded subtitles are sometimes hard to read.  There is a version of this released by Dimension Video(grrrr)that has been retitled Meltdown and has been shortened by 10 minutes and also has gotten a horrible new soundtrack including English dubbing and rap music replacing what was in the original.  Doesn't matter which one you get because the Chinese version isn't really any better since it is not a good movie to begin with.",

            "input": "The Great Muttering Sailor Man . Opinions are like noses: everyone has one. Some like it, some don't. Let me say this, however, in defense of this 1980 movie starring Robin Williams as Popeye. It is certainly unfair to say, by any stretch, that this is 'the worst movie of all-time', or 'one of the worst...'. It is funny how, at the time of this writing, that the average vote for this film is about 4.5 stars...Actually that is about right. For those who do not know about the wonderful website called The Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com), you really need to check it out. [...] My point is this: There are many opinions. So if you have never seen this movie, decide for yourself. Do you remember the incredible muttering Popeye (done by Jack Mercer on the cartoons)?. I'm talking especially about the early Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons from the 30's. You know, the ones in black-and-white. That's what I loved the most, the muttering Popeye. Well, Robin Williams does it superbly! Also, Shelly Duvall is excellent as Olive Oyl in this movie. Granted, the story is kind of bland. The music is not always top notch. Yes, it is too long. However, I enjoyed watching Robin Williams' masterful portrayal of everyone's favorite Sailor Man. Sure, Olive can get a little annoying at times, but wasn't she basically that way in the cartoons? So if you loved the muttering Popeye, then you'll love the movie, overall. Never mind the story. The storyline doesn't really matter, I feel. But, alas, you say you cannot really remember those vintage Popeye cartoon shorts too well. Not to worry! They are scheduled to be released on DVD... FULLY RESTORED!!! Volume 1 (1933 - 1938), with a July 2007 scheduled release, will have, in my opinion, the very best of all the 230 total Popeye cartoon shorts. (Incidently, William Costello provided Popeye's voice from 1933 until sometime in 1935. He was very good also, but the really GREAT muttering came when Jack Mercer took over in 1935). By all means, if you are a huge Popeye fan like myself, then you absolutely must get these DVDs. After listening to the great Jack Mercer, and watching the incredible animation in those early years, then compare Popeye to Robin Williams' version. I dare say, you will see the similarity. So, the bottom line is: See for yourself. If you love Popeye, the character, then you will not be disappointed with Robin Williams' performance. The movie itself... well, you be the judge. Likely you have a nose, so without a doubt you, too will have an opinion. It's ALL alright.",

They answered the 2004 Boston Red Sox box set with a Yankee compilation that was second to none.    While the Red Sox set included only the 2004 World Series the Yankees collection includes some of the greatest World Series Games of the Joe Torre Era.  The Red Sox set is guaranteed to last 86 years so it should keep the Sox fans happy for a long time.  This set includes five complete World Series Games, all of which are Yankee victories of course.  And if that wasn't enough, in addition to the complete games there are two bonus disks.      As exciting as the complete games are, unfortunately it doesn't include John Sterling and Michael Kay like the YES Network Yankee Classics do.  It does include the original national broadcasts, which has commentators that feature Bob Costas, Joe Buck, Tim McCarver and Joe Morgan.  The picture couldn't be sharper and it does seem to be a full featured DVD as opposed to some past releases.      The full games included 1996 Game 4 which features Jimmy Leyritz leading the Yanks back from a 6-0 deficit to a 8-6 extra inning triumph that tied the series at 2 all.  The next game is another come from behind victory.  The third game of the 1998 series features the Bombers beating San Diego ace reliever Trevor Hoffman.    The third complete game is another game three, this one again against the Braves that features a walk off homer by Chad Curtis.  Mariano Rivera took a win this time around instead of his usual save. The forth complete game DVD is a Game 5 series ender against the Mets in 2000, the first Subway Series since 1956.  The Yankees won it in the top of the ninth on a single by super sub Louie Sojo.  Mike Stanton got the win in relief of Andy Pettitte.  The loss went to former Yankee farmhand Al Leiter.      The final complete game while a Yankee victory is unusual in the fact that the Yankees lost this series to the Arizona Diamondbacks.  What made this game unique was that this was the 911-year and due to the suspension of baseball that year at midnight of that game it became November.  It was the first baseball game played in November.  And Derek Jeter homered in the bottom of the tenth thus becoming the first \"Mr. November\".      The two Bonus DVDs are worth the price of admission on their own.  They include all the MLB World Series videos plus a plethora of bonus footage that includes Roger \"Rocket\" Clemens 2000 ALSC game 4 masterpiece. Other inclusions are highlights from Gooden's No Hitter, David Cone's and David Well's Perfect Games, Jeter's ALDS series saving flip, and many other highlights by names like David Justice, Jim Leyritz, and Paul O'Neill.  There is abundance of behind the scenes footage that includes locker room, interviews and press conferences and much, much more.        The packaging is a Trivia Buffs delight as it is full of boxscores, highlights and facts.  It will jar your memory reading the cases alone.     These disks are a must have for Yankee fans.   As soon as I posted the banners I saw many of you pre order these fine DVDs.  So what are the rest of you waiting for?",

The movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist, which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase. After that, the movie seems to fizzle out.    There is not much dialogue and I think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film. The acting is pretty bad all around, although I think Snipes did what he could with what he as given.    The directing is frazzled and just plain weird. I didn't like it much at all. I think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse.    Given the right attention, this movie could have been great but I get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could. It has potential, but in my opinion, everyone involved in it just fell flat.    I had trouble getting through the whole thing. If you are a die hard Snipes fan then you might want to rent it, but I don't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not. It just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious I have ever seen.    Don't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you've wasted your time watching it. Only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are",

Reading these reviews, I was surprised by a number of the comments but most of all by those that rented/bought this movie believing it was somehow about \"angels\" and then had the nerve to complain that they didn't know what it was about or that there were no angels in the movie.    With that in mind, I'd like to offer some advice to those that may inadvertently rent/buy other movies:    There are no Cuckoo birds and no nests in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  There is no obvious wind in Gone With the Wind and what there was didn't blow anything away  There are few, if any, good fellas in Goodfellas  There are no lambs in Silence of the Lambs  Chinatown isn't set in a town in China  There is neither $1,000,000 nor a baby in Million Dollar Baby  You guessed it, no bulls in Raging Bull  The coats are made of denim or some such material in Full Metal Jacket  Paul Newman's body temperature is about 98.6 degrees just like the rest of us in Cool Hand Luke  There is little, if any, sleeping in The Big Sleep  The prison hallway is only a few feet long in The Green Mile  The African Queen is not about a gay black man  No waterfowl were hurt in the making of Duck Soup  The earth rotated as usual on the Day the Earth Stood Still  There are actually multiple conversations in The Conversation  The raunchy men's magazine does not appear in The Hustler  Nobody inherited the wind in Inherit the Wind. It still belongs to all of us  There is no discernible odor while watching The Sweet Smell of Success  All the President's Men is only about *some* of the president's men    I hope that some will find these simple reminders useful. If not, you may want to consider looking at the back of a DVD case, visiting your local library or going to one of the thousands of web sites that talk about every movie ever made.    As for this film, if you're not frightened by things that might be different than what you've experienced or that perhaps strike too close to home, and don't spend your time judging how everyone else lives, then there is much to love about this work. It may not be perfect, and there can be many legitimate gripes about it, but overall it's very, very good. Scan through the positive reviews here and you'll get a good sense of it. No need for me to repeat it all here. Unfortunately, most (but not all) of the negative reviews are just those with some sort of political/religious agenda to put forth instead of commenting on the film",

As Dr. Dysart delves into the causes leading up to the event he soon realizes he is dealing with more than just a confused, emotionally unstable teenager.

The greatness of the movie lay in Dudley Moores registration of wit shown by his mercurical, elegant and moving use of facial expressions and repartee with Brian Denehey at the bar and especially at the piano, revealing both great depth of feeling and consumate artistry as a musician. This piano scene, alone reason for 5 stars, was the saving grace.",

            "input": "One of the best movies ever made, one of the best DVDs ever made. . \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is one of the best films ever made and Fox has recently released a fitting two disc DVD edition of the film. Fitting because the DVD is one of the best I have ever seen.    Directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman, the God of screenwriters, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross. How could a film with this pedigree be anything but good?    What you may not realize, or know, is that this film made Robert Redford the star he is today. Paul Newman, already an established star having appeared in \"Hud\", \"Cool Hand Luke\" and \"The Hustler\", among others, was a bankable star and the film was made because he agreed to make it. Initially, he wanted to play the Sundance Kid, but eventually settled on the role of Cassidy. Robert Redford was not new to film, but he was nowhere near the icon he would become. He had some early success which was followed by a few clunkers. The pair became a match made in heaven and would go on to appear in more films together. On screen, they appear to be friends, much like their characters, and this adds to the charm of their relationship.    Redford clearly recognizes the influence this film had on his career. His famous film academy and film festival are named after his character in the film.    Butch and Sundance decide to rob the mail car of a train owned by a powerful rail baron. Butch is tired of the work and wants to retire, but he needs one or two big scores to set him up. After blowing up the rail car, they run off with the loot and hide out in a small town, at a brothel they frequent. Meeting up with the rest of their gang, they quell a revolt and decide to do one more job. They will rob the same mail car on the same railway, on its next run through the area. It is the perfect crime, no one would suspect the same train being robbed, so it will probably be loaded with money. After blowing up the car for a second time, they notice another locomotive speeding towards them and a crew of men on horseback alight from the car and give chase, chasing Butch and Sundance, and their two accomplices, for days, across many terrains. Finally, they realize the rail baron has hired a famous Indian tracker to help a band of men, including a former sheriff who is now a famous bounty hunter, catch the duo. After the chase, they return to the home of Ella (Katharine Ross), the Sundance Kid's girlfriend. Tired, they decide to leave the country and travel to Bolivia and begin robbing banks there.    As I watched this DVD of \"Butch Cassidy\", two things quickly became apparent. This film is virtually timeless. With the lone exception of the song \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\", the film could've been made yesterday, the images are so clear. The second is that the DVD print is one of the most beautiful transfers I have ever watched. The cinematography by Conrad Hall (who would later work on \"American Beauty\" among others) is simply stunning and brings out all of the rich detail of the landscape. Everything is crisp and clear, when it is supposed to be, colors are bright and vivid, it's just beautiful to watch. It doesn't hurt that the stars are two of the most handsome men to ever appear in film, at the prime of their careers, and one of the most beautiful women to ever co-star. How did anyone get past all of that eye candy?    The key to becoming fully invested in this film is William Goldman's screenplay. He introduces the characters in action, we learn as we go, and they are almost always moving, or doing something. Goldman fills their mouths with witty dialogue, showing us how their relationship works, and they are instantly likeable to us. This is basically a love triangle with Ross' Ella playing the go-between. The two men have a very close friendship, enjoying each other's company. But Cassidy loves Ella as well, even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend is the recipient of this woman's love, so they get along. Then, there is the famous chase. The railway baron's men chase Butch and Sundance for days, taking up a significant chunk of the film. But this scene proves to us how committed the two men are to each other and makes their future trek to Bolivia all the more believable. We have to believe there is a real threat and these men never let up on the chase, if they catch Butch and Sundance, they will be killed. As soon as they reach Bolivia, Goldman has a lot of fun with the characters again, exploring their relationships, rebuilding them in a way, and making them light hearted again. It is almost amazing to watch this film because if a studio executive were presented with the same screenplay today, it would probably not be made. It doesn't hit plot points at pre-determined pages, it tells an unconventional story, and we never actually see the villains. Goldman had the luxury of writing this film during a period in which studios were still able to work with somewhat unconventional screenplays. Of course, they wanted to make money as well, but they still considered film an art form.    George Roy Hill is an underappreciated director. I think a large part of this is because many of his films are very humorous. Comedy is not as highly respected in Hollywood as drama, even though making a good comedy is much more difficult. So I suspect the humorous elements of most of his films made him less respected in Hollywood, but when your films are as good as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"The Sting\", you deserve some respect. He made his share of duds, but when he passed away a few years ago, Hollywood was robbed of a talent ready to make at least a few more classics.    During this period, big screen Westerns were becoming unpopular. Perhaps the dearth of television westerns was keeping the public out of the theaters, but this genre was considered risky at the time. Recent films starring Burt Lancaster and others were failing to light the box office fire. The second disc contains a new \"Making of\" feature including interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, former studio executives David Brown and Richard Zanuck and more. Zanuck reveals that he took a real chance in greenlighting this film, but fought for it all the way. He also haggled with Hill and the filmmakers, in an attempt to keep the budget under control; he became concerned when the film was projected to cost about $7.5 million (consider the average studio film now costs at least $125 million). But the film would go on to be a big hit. Such a huge hit the filmmakers followed this with the equally popular \"The Sting\".    The second DVD also contains some archival interviews with the stars, some trailers and more.    In the \"Making Of\" documentary, they discuss the inclusion of the song \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\". People fought against it but Hill and composer Burt Bacharach felt it would be the perfect accompaniment to the scene of Butch and Ella riding a new-fangled bike through her barn yard. It does work, but it is clearly not a fit for the period depicted in the film, and is the most dated element within the film today. It just seems silly today.    \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is a superlative example of the treatment all classics should receive on DVD. This is a film every DVD library should have",

We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is \"banging the boss\".    But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.    Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.      The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.    The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.    The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.  And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors.   You will laugh until it hurts.    DVD EXTRAS:  Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly    9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily. Jane, Dolly and Dabney Coleman.    Deleted Scenes - 10 mostly expanded scenes or alternate takes.  The problem is without some kind of commentary we do not know why the scene was cut.",

The reviews I had read for it made it sound like a rip-off of Akira, and the first hour or so makes you think it just might be it.    A group of friends who are in a sort of Xtreme motorcycle sport find themselves in the middle of their nation Aphrodia invaded by the nation of their enemy Ishtar. They quickly find themselves under military rule, and have to deal with life changing in such a time period. The group eventually decides to do some guerilla action and attack an enemy tank that is always in their stadium.     Then, just as the tank is destroyed and reinforcements are coming up, and the hero is about to be run over...a Free IO soldier fires a missile into the Octo and destroys it.    Then the movie becomes a story of a nation fighting for their freedom, as the group joins the free soldiers who are fighting Ishtar all the way back out of IO. Eventually the hero, at first sympathetic, is convinced to join forces. The final battle takes place in the capital of IO, and what a climax it is.    Overall, the film boasts fine animation and retro 80's anime design. The action is well done and the mecha designs even better, and the storyline is also exceptionally well done. You get a good sense of a population under foreign rule, and its good to see an anime exploring such depths. Also, the politics of a nation in exile fighting for their return is equally unique. Maybe its because I'm a political nut, but I found it all interesting.    If I had known I would have enjoyed this film, I would have watched it far sooner than I did. Oh well...I bought the DVD the minute I saw it. I'm proud to own it. And thats my word",

I loved getting to know the Russian or Ukrainian people and their culture; the old as well as the new.     Alex is so charming and funny at the same time, with his ideas of hip hop and the American culture; and wisdom that seems beyond his years. Elijah Wood was wonderful as the eccentric little American Jew named Jonathan who seemed very meek and a little bumbling (he had a phobia of dogs and almost couldn't get into the car with one), but he was amazingly brave to go on his quest in a country he knew nothing about to find the woman who helped his grandfather escape from the Nazis in WWII. Alex's grandfather, who insisted that he was blind, yet he drove the tour car that they all rode in, was such a character; a combination of harsh from the years of hardship he'd had in his life, and yet with a soft tender side underneath that showed up every once in a while.    The Russian songs throughout the movie were perfect and pulled you right into the story. The scenery was amazing. It all made me want to visit Ukraine. If you haven't watched this movie, do it!",

The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers.     The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the \"Limited Edition\" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release.    Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him.    One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one.",

We all see different films, even when we see the same film. \"City of God\" is especially like that, with it's linked stories that give multiple perspectives--not unlike the linked stories used in postmodern novels. \"City of God\" gives us a story of crime, poverty, drugs, sex, homelessness, corruption, community (in its own way), even odd bits of humor--and a way out.    A Special Feature on this DVD is the documentary \"News from a Personal War\" which uses the same technique of multiple perspecitves in a brilliant effort to give a rounded view to a complex story of the drug war in Rio.    The movie I see would be titled \"Portrait of an Artist as a Young Brazilian\" played by Alexandre Rodrigues as Rocket who narrates \"City of God.\" The DVD jacket says it so well: \". . . a frail and scared young boy will grow up to discover that he can view the harsh realities of his surroundings with a different eye: the eye of an artist.\" I love the moment when his photos are discovered by the newpaper through a mistake and how that leads to Rocket's career as a journalistic photographer--and his first hot shower, followed by his first sexual experience. This last part of the film is thrilling as Rocket moves into a new world and then rockets between them.    Remember the lyrics that had a bouncing ball on top telling you what word to sing next? Just follow the bouncing ball here--the words and story line of the young narrator as his heart's wish comes true and he demonstrates considerable courage.    --Janet Grace Riehl, author \"Sightlines: A Poet's Diary",

The whole cast is wasted in this movie, and most of which I have seen in movies that I liked better. Like pretty much the leads in this movies, I have seen thier movies and liked htem better in, but this one, they might as well. If your a Tim Allen fan, please do yourself a favor, and get either the Santa Clause movies, or the Toy Story movies, and avoid this movie at all costs. Here are 99 minuts of my life, that I won't see again, and I am trying to make sure that you don't waste your time on this dud. Who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog, in some scenes in the movie, ore pretty much the whole thing. I haven't seen Monster House or Cars, but I hope that these will be 2 better movies, or maybe a season dvd of Home Improvement will be pretty then this. Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard). And he is up for accused of trying to torch the California headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate Grant & Strictland. And he doesn't much of a family life, since he is never home, and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie? His wife is Rebecca Douglas (Kristin Davis) and they have 2 children Josh (Spencer Breslin) and Carly (Zena Grey). And he has an appoontment to Josh's PTA meetings, and even through he is reminded at work, he forgets. Carly is not only a is both Forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn't sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.",

Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau) is one of a group of West German terrorists who spring fellow terrorist, Andrea (Harald Schrott) from jail. Several people are shot during the jailbreak, and the group goes on the lam to Paris. While in Paris, Rita kills a policeman, and the terrorists are once again on the run--this time they slip into East Germany with the help of Stasi officer Erwin Hull (Martin Wuttke) who befriended Rita when she was recognized upon entering East Berlin before. Since the heat is on the group, Erwin makes an offer--the terrorists can accept a new life--with new identities in East Germany, or they can be flown out to Beirut. While everyone else elects Beirut, Rita decides to stay in East Germany.     Rita assumes a new identity in East Germany, and her adjustment to her environment is at the heart of \"The Legend of Rita\" from director Volker Schlondorff. The plot places Rita in some interesting situations. Her first job, for example, is in a factory where she befriends Tatjana (Nadja Uhl). Tatjana loathes East Germany, and would love to live in the West. She can't understand why Rita (now living under an assumed name) would give up Western freedoms and chose to live under Communist rule. In the meantime, Rita's former rebelliousness against the state has simply disappeared, and she's become a drone--speaking the party line and accepting whatever she's told to do. When Rita's new identity is threatened, she has little choice but to move on--leaving Tatjana and their budding lesbian affair.     The film fails to fulfill its promise, however, on several layers. Rita becomes a pawn for the Stasi--every move she makes is watched, and every conversation she has is taped. The film could have chosen to tackle some fascinating complex arguments--Rita's ideology, for example, and the challenge she faces in either rejecting her beliefs or sticking to them in the face of such nauseating, and threatening Orwellian bureaucracy. The plot shows Rita as mindlessly accepting what she is told to do--she doesn't question her freedoms, and by making Rita a drone, she is a far less interesting character. Instead, the film concentrates on Rita's two love interests. Also, if you are expecting to discover something about the Red Army Faction (RAF) here, keep looking. This is not a film about the RAF. There is an excellent book by Stefan Aust on the subject, but it's rare to find a copy in English. I recommend \"How It All Began\" By Bommi Baumann and \"Televisionaries: The Red Army Faction Story 1963-1993\" by Tom Vague. \"The Legend of Rita\" is worth watching for all fans of German film out there. Overall, the film's message argues strongly against aligning oneself with any political ideals. In German with English subtitles--displacedhuma",

The 1950s 'babe' played by Jayne is a period piece, but having lived in Las vegas for the past five years, I can tell the readers of this review that the type is alive and well in this city. The  film is about a certain niche, created by men and probably by religion too,  and into this niche women step and become stigmatized. The whore or babe is  like the witch in the medieval period - something demonic and devilish. I  assure you, the values in the film are not out-of-date. The movie also is  an interesting source of info about ethnicity and regionalism - espec.  Italian and the NYC area. And you see in this a connection to Las Vegas  too. The film, if it teaches anything, teaches us that we are far less  emancipated, liberated, rational, liberal, etc. in regard to sex and to  women than we thought we were. Again the parallel to witchcraft is a good  one: naive liberals thought the witch-hunting was over in the early 1700s.  In fact, witches were burned in all major European ocuntries into the late  1700s. And 1950s babes a la Mansfield are not only the adult identity of  many, especially in Las Vegas, in the year 2000, but are probably the  role-models of 6 and 7 year olds. ...",

There is nothing original in this story about a young man who is a disappointment to his father, has a problem with authority figures, and has yet to find his place in the world.  The plot is predictable from beginning to end and so cliche-ridden it will make your teeth ache.  James Franco has good screen presence and he can act, although he is limited.  Tyrese Gibson on the other hand is totally unbelievable in his role as Franco's antagonist.  He simply always looks like he's acting the entire time.  His character isn't even defined well and his reasons for going after Franco's character lacks sincerity and believability.    The direction and writing is just all over the place in this film that isn't sure what it want to be, so it tries very hard to be everything.  It wants to be a basic training kind of film a la \"G.I. Jane\" while also trying to be a sports film with its boxing substory.  It wants to introduce us to the world of a first class naval academy while also trying to tell us how naval vessels are built.  It throws in everything else from race relations to father and son psycho-babble.  I was waiting for the kitchen sink to be thrown in for good measure.    The film was okay overall when all was said and done.  I had some fun with it and Franco is fun to watch.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it was glaringly not as good as it could have been.  While viewing this film one is liable to keep saying, \"if they only did this\" or \"if they had only done that.\"  That leaves a bad taste in one's mouth",

Not often do we see a movie full of comedy and drama at the same time.     The beginning is very light stuff, but midway into the movie we start to see the darkside of humanity. John Hurt turns in a magnificent performance as Judd's client in a murder case. Judd can't decide if his client is innocent or guilty, but once he knows for sure he has to learn new tactics in dealing with the judicial system.

Mutiny, Doomsday, The Invaders, The Indestructible Man, The Buccaneer, The Human Computer, The Saboteur, Cradle of the Deep, and The Enemies are top-notch.  I've always loved Seaview's incredible monsters and Mutiny's giant jellyfish is a sight to behold.  The threat of nuclear war is realistically portrayed in Doomsday.  I still get shivers up and down my spine when Robert Duvall opens his eyes in The Invaders and when the robot stalks Patterson and Kowalski in The Indestructible Man.  Only Seaview would have an episode about someone bold enough to steal the Mona Lisa.  This story (The Buccaneer) works because the villian is believable (a touch gay by today's standards but that's why the story works) and the relationships between the crew members are emphasized.  In The Human Computer, Seaview is controlled by a computer that's supposed to replace the crew.  Star Trek did a similar story but Seaview's is better because only Crane and an enemy agent are on board and the sight of these 2 men stalking each other on the deserted sub have great impact.  By far the best episode for me is The Enemies.  With it's crazy cold war politics, Crane and Nelson against the bad guys, and that wonderful room where people on one side seem gigantic compared to those on the other side, how could this episode miss.  As always, the special effects, the black and white photography, and Paul Sawtell's wonderful theme make Seaview one old series that's worth visiting over and over again",

Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it.      I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.    I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say \"I hated the ending, very predictable\" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.    So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out.    If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews.    If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)    And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie.     But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film",

Because some of them are repeat motion picture pedophiles, of a sort; or they exhibit repeat youth stalking and posturing behaviors indicating a suggestive or manipulative inducement scam of industrially applied psychological warfare to goad uninformed youth imprinting boobytraps.  That is the subject of this semiotic critical study.  You know where the exit is if you're not up for it.  Voting buttons are for political circuses, state your own case and leave others unmolested.  The First Amendment is ratified; it is not up for repeal.  Enter:     There is no more need for obsequiously flattering supplications to a menace lurking in our communities, nor the hundredth re-written version of a content synopsis--those forms of reviewing anything are pass√Ø¬ø¬Ω mental laziness playing right into a trap.  There is no such thing as an American idol or icon or celebrity worship.  There is commerce, enticement, inducement and stupidity; and absolutely no curriculum allowed in the schools dealing with the subject of Anti-commercial Thinking Skills for Intellectual Self Preservation and Defense.      If Leni Rifle'nall, subsequent to the destruction of European fascism and its motion picture cameras, had to work under cover still trying to cast the ideological mold for society in the socialistic-fascist agenda, she'd probably be pushed into film projects that use stories and situations in juxtaposition to target children and other sore nerves like mother's and kidnapping... `The Forgotten.'  And she'd probably be in a position of unannounced executive, overriding film directorate to even suggest such crypto-fascists titles; or what would convert into having the ear of those controlling the pool of her pre-selected film scripts and directors in whatever kulture of mass entertainment media manufacture.    Poor animation, bereft of ideas and recycling a lunatic zoo escapade from earlier motion picture non-greatness; for the purpose of Catholic bashing and youth corruption.    Ecstatic performances are actually religion related catharsis, for motion picture redundancy it only amounts to acting out the most, screaming, shouting the most, being the most behaviorally intimating of instability or violence--that whole center of attention, infant terrible prestige and again, involving a `childish fascination with aircraft', motorcycles, airlines like in `The Forgotten', childhood affectations of wealth, intellect and power.  What about this latest ripoff of the movie 'Dog Day Afternoon', also having to import limes and posture a sublime disrespect for Black law enforcement as being at no recognizable `pay grade'?  That's an awfully irritating display of arrogance too, and saying that robbing banks and shooting people is determined solely by the ripe attitude `because I can'.  The public only sees another rotten lime, (TV's \"Hell's Kitchen\"), in a marvelous artistic achievement for public good, peace and civility--let's give her a hand, to retirement.  Bait unrest, bait contempt, weaken morale, trigger something, anything.  It can still get them while they're young and dumb; ain't that right Columbine?     After school special animation fantasy?  What is the correct genre for this film?  Because it didn't work and whatever interesting acting (at least) there might've been, it's probably a tool for creating the next cipher army of cybernetic John Hinkleys.  Was it on the Larry King interview there was rumor of a film titled `Amanda Plummer'?  Or was that a decidedly misleading invention to hide the Catholic bash in `The secret lives of altar boys?'    Well, we've heard about the scandal surrounding the secret lives of alter boys, but maybe we don't really appreciate how secret their associations can be.  I guess a substantial career in propaganda speaks for itself and only provides test cases for subversion analysis in hazardous media, appliances of mass population psychological operations.  And that is actually more entertaining that viewing any movie completely prone to its presumptive spin-aplomb.  It isn't a big, important celebrity; it isn't a big exciting new picture release; it isn't even a story or film making, it is a method of conditioned response inducement...for statistical confidence interval estimator...neurolinguistic, demographic psychometric programming--exotically scientific and childishly deviant.  That's probably all that the Master Kulture Ultra section of Military Intelligence, or \"MI\" ever amounted to--the hubris of hitler's photography harlot, and no doubt whole schools of socialistic engineering, just like that childish fascination with aircraft raid on the national budget, absolutely every infernal contraption to stroke the ego of super-genius design engineers with all sorts of Flight Plan(s).    What next, with tens of thousands of high school students failing their graduation exams in every state, not just California; won't the White ethnic esteem have but few historic priding tokens to defend its `superiority'?  Won't the College Republicans at Utah State University toy with students of international and family origins due to their non-Anglo ethnic and language attributes, by inviting them to write an essay justifying scholarship monies set aside for them?  Of course this is happening in America.  It appears the trustees of the edifice have abandoned their little writing-contest darlings at USU, and then encourage them to slander and humiliate people of color in lily White Logan Utah.    Sociologically, the roots of cinematic agitation for White aggression can always be traced back to the weakness to not examine the fault that lies within the self, and not others; to spurn the so called `immigrants' and question the need to recognize their languages, or to complain about the provisions they have made for their children's education.      Motion pictures plied to a chronic genre of population demoralization are an indicator of national subversion for political agendas.  When they manipulate a context of youth development, they are also trying to strike at more susceptible, programmable victims.  Glamorization of violence, mayhem, crime-spree destruction is no more acceptable in video gaming entertainment that they are at the movies, (it's been done till it's being overdone sticks out like the sore thumb it is).  Boycott such movies, burn your copy of them instead of the flag for the evening news cameras; be more critically selective of the means to protest so that it doesn't ring hollow.  Procure movie bills, big and fancy, and symbolically destroy them, even make movies of those effigies and put them on the web.  Fight back.

            "input": "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light. . I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. The movie is included among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This New Line Platinum Series edition is really beautiful, with a DVD case simulating the notebook that John Doe uses in the movie, and with a second disc full of supplemental material. I miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory \"How it was made\" or \"Behind the Scenes\" documentary. You see deleted scenes and extended takes, alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards, etc. The movie in Disc One comes with an audio track specially recorded for the DVD edition, and in my Home Theatre sounds terrific. Also we have 4 different audio commentaries, by director Fincher, Freeman, Pitt and other collaborators on the film.  This is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives (one new -Pitt- another about to retire -Freeman-) after a serial killer (always brilliant Spacey) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins, and kills people who represents them. After the 5th murder, he turns himself in and the last two (Envy and Wrath) are just a masterpiece of an invention. I've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times, but I can't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story.   This is a masterpiece of a movie. I rarely give 10/10 points to movies, so I gave this 9.5/10. To be picky, I'd like a \"Hit\" song with the closing credits. But that is just me being picky. The music by Howard Shore is good. The photography is excellent, the script is in my opinion the very best, and Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are fabulous. The movie was nominated for Best Film Editing for the Academy Awards but won nothing.  A must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. And for the price ($13.99 while I am writing this) you can't get any wrong",

            "input": "The second worst dinosaur movie . First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.    The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.    It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.    If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)    If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.    If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'    But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park",

So don't be fooled by the PG rating - it's not for kids. There's a pretty intense attempted rape scene as well. I detected no real political agenda except maybe a shot at nationalism, which deserves to be shot",

            "input": "Feeling a bit shafted . Okay, I've wanted this film for a very long time, so this year I finally get around to ordering it.  However, I wasn't aware that Ridley Scott ever put together a director's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this DVD being the director's cut.  So, it gets delivered, I open it up excitedly...and see a box on the cover that says INCLUDES RIDLEY SCOTT'S DIRECTOR'S CUT WITH JERRY GOLDSMITH'S SCORE.  Okay, cool.  It INCLUDES the director's cut.  That implies that BOTH the theatrical release AND the director's cut are on the disc.  Not so.  This is ONLY the director's cut...and to be honest, it's not all that great.  And Goldsmith's score is NOT one of his better ones.  I was WANTING the Theatrical Release with that wonderful score by Tangerine Dream, the version I remember seeing so many years ago.  So, now I have to shell out the money for the ULTIMATE EDITION which has both versions on it.  If Amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which.  I feel about as shafted as when I bought \"The Exorcist\" on DVD...only to get THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN, which was equally lame",

I am not one who scares easily and this film was frightening. I loved watching it with my husband, because it was so much fun to see him jump during the movie! I totally recommend renting/purchasing this from the Black Sabboth trilogy collection. Happy haunting!    Pam from Eagle Mountain Lake, Texa",
