The water percolates beneath the land surface. Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water. Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation. The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide. A weak carbonic acid solution is formed. This acid slowly dissolves calcite, forms solution cavities, and excavates passageways. ",

Thousands of these hexagonal cylinders put together form the hive. ",
