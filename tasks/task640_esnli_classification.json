    "Definition": "Given a premise and a hypothesis, determine if the hypothesis (second sentence) can be concluded from the premise and assigning it a label among entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Entailment means thats the hypothesis makes sense/follows after the premise. Neutral means that the hypothesis does not follow the premise but also does not contradict the premise. Contradiction means that the hypothesis clearly contradicts the premise.",
