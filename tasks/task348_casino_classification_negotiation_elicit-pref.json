    "Definition": "The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context, output Yes if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, otherwise output No. elicit-pref is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation.",

'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.' Utterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",
