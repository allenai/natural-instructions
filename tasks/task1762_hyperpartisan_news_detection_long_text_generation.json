However deep their divisions,they keep them secret from the outside world.Not so the Libyan rebels. Members of their Transitional National Council (TNC) in Benghazi last month detained their military leader, GeneralAbdel Fatah Younes, on suspicion of treachery,lured him away from his bodyguards and murderedhim. This week the head of the TNC, Mustafa AbdelJalil, sacked his whole government on the grounds that some were complicit in the killing. He was apparently forced to do so in order to quell therage of the powerful Obeidi tribe to which Younesbelonged. A ludicrous aspect of the wholeaffair is that at the very moment the rebelleaders are at each others throats, they are being recognised by country after country asthe legitimate government of Libya. This week TNC diplomats took over the Libyan embassies in Londonand Washington and are about to do so in Ottawa.In a masterpiece of mistiming, Britain recognizedthe rebel government on the day when some of itsmembers were shooting their own commander-in-chiefand burning his body. If this is how therebels behave today, when it is much in theirinterests to make a show of unity, how will theyact once they are installed in power in Tripoli?But NATOs sole policy is to do just that. AUN Security Council resolution, intended to stopGaddafis tanks taking Benghazi forhumanitarian reasons in March, transmuted rapidlyinto a bid to overthrow him. Britain and France,with essential backing from the US, still maintainthat the good of the Libyan people requires thereplacement of Gaddafi with those sturdy democratsfrom Benghazi and eastern Libya represented by theTNC. Could a strategy of brute force workin a purely military sense? Could the rebelcolumns of pick-up trucks with machine-guns in theback advance to capture Tripoli behind a creeping barrage supplied by NATO firepower? The Libyan capital is increasingly short of fuel, consumergoods and electricity. The rebels havebeen making gains on the ground to the east andsouth-west of the capital. But even with thesupport of NATO air strikes the advance has beenslow. If the rebels make such a meal of taking atown like Brega, with a population of 4,000, onthe Gulf of Sirte, can they really fight their wayinto Tripoli with a population of 1.7 million?Gaddafi may fall, but it looks increasinglythat, if he does, it will be at the hands of arag-tag collection of militias ever more dependentfor success on being backed by tactical supportfrom NATO aircraft. Given that the rebels lack acoherent leadership or a united military force,the outcome is unlikely to be a clear-cut victory.Even if victorious, the rebels will depend onforeign support at every level to exert authorityover this vast country. As withAfghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, the US andBritain found it was one thing to overthrow theTaliban or Saddam Hussein and quite another toreplace them. Treating dubious local allies as thelegitimate government has a propaganda value, butit is unwise to pretend that the local partnercarries real authority. With this experience underits belt, it required real fecklessness forBritain to plunge into another conflict on theassumption that this time we were betting on acertain winner. Gaddafi may be overthrown but thestruggle for power between internal factions islikely to continue. Colorful, butwoefully misleading The foreign media hadits failings in Iraq, was worse in Afghanistan buthas reached its nadir in covering the war inLibya. Reporting has become largely militarized.Much of it is colorful stuff from the frontlineabout the dashes backwards and forwards of rebelmilitiamen. It takes courage to report this andreporters naturally empathize with the young menwith whom they are sharing a trench. Theircoverage tends to be wholly in favor of the rebelsand in opposition to Gaddafi. When AbdelFatah Younes was murdered almost nobody in theforeign media had an explanation as to how or whyit had happened. The rebel leadership, previouslyportrayed as a heroic band of brothers, turned outto be split by murderous rivalries and vendettas.Some reporters simply regurgitated the rebelauthorities unlikely claim that the generalhad been killed by pro-Gaddafi fighters with campsin Benghazi, while others mentioned that therewere 30 different Islamic militias in thecity. To this day politicians justifyNATOs intervention in Libya by citingatrocities supposedly carried out by pro-Gaddafiforces such as mass rape or extensive use ofmercenaries. Human rights organisations such asAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch longago revealed that there was no evidence for mostof the atrocity stories, as did a UN commissionheaded by the distinguished legal scholar CherifBassiouni. These well-researched reports werealmost entirely ignored by the media which firstpublished the Gaddafi atrocity stories.The militarization of reporting in Iraq andAfghanistan was boosted by the system of embedding reporters with militaryunits. This was inevitable to a degree given thedanger from Iraqi insurgents or Taliban. But theoutcome has been that war reporting has revertedto what it was during imperial skirmishes in the19th century, with the world getting only apartial and often misleading account of what ishappening in Libya.

            "input": "bias:left-center###hyperpartisan:No###article:WASHINGTON&#160;(RNS) One group ofChristians confidently proclaims that a plainreading of the Bible is a slam-dunk in theirfavor. The other side appeals to Scripturesgrand narrative toward freedom and inclusivelove. The argument boils over and ripplesthrough the wider culture. The search formiddle ground proves futile. Denominations breakapart. Sound familiar? It could be 2010  or the mid-19th century. As churches and denominations in the UnitedStates slog through divisive and long-runningarguments over homosexuality, many Protestantprogressives have sought to claim the historicaland moral high ground by aligning their cause withabolitionism. I think almosteverybody who makes the liberal argument abouthomosexuality makes the connection with abolitionand slavery, said Jeffrey Krehbiel, aWashington, D.C., pastor in the PresbyterianChurch (USA) who supports gay rights.Abolitionists, he said, were the firstto make the argument that the plain reading of thetext maybe isnt the most fruitful way toread the Bible. But while thereare striking parallels between the slavery andhomosexuality debates, historians caution thatimportant differences emerge upon closeexamination. In both eras, culturaltrends forced Christians to question practicesthat long had been taken for granted, said MarkNoll, a professor of American religious history atthe University of Notre Dame and author of TheCivil War as a Theological Crisis.Likewise, the Bible, and how to interpret it,has played a central role both then and now, Nollsaid. In the 19th century, even someNorthern abolitionists concluded the Biblecondoned slavery. Many, therefore, soughtother sources of morality and methods of biblicalinterpretation; conservatives countered that suchappeals undermined the power of the sacredtext. As conflict heated up, Noll writesin his book, slaverys defendersincreasingly saw doubts about biblicaldefense of slavery as doubts about the authorityof the Bible itself. As withslavery, few Christians are neutral onhomosexuality. Like the situationin the 1830s and 40s, once a certain kindof heat is generated, it becomes really hard totalk through these various kinds of debatingstrategies and implications, Noll said.Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists andto some extent, Episcopalians all splitover slavery, mainly along the Mason-Dixon Line.Some reunited decades later. Baptists re-mainapart to this day. Likewise, in the lastfew years, a number of mainline Protestantcongregations have parted with their denominationsover homosexuality, although in far fewer numbersthan during mid-19th century splits. Butthe exodus may not be over. For example,conservative Presbyterians and United Methodistshave threatened to leave en masse if theirdenominations decides to allow gay clergy andsame-sex marriages. The parallelsto the contemporary debate are fairlystriking, said Mark Valeri, a professor ofchurch history at Union Presbyterian Seminary inRichmond, Va. You have a long-simmering moral dispute that heats up anecclesiastical and political question, whichresults in a division. And thequestion is, when the division creates branches,how courts adjudicate those disputes. But there are key differences between thedisputes over slavery and homosexuality, somehistorians say. For instance, manyconservatives say that it is not simply the gayissue that is driving them out the door, but along liberal trend in mainline denominations thatstretches back 30 years or more. Second,Scripture shows only a grudging tolerance ofslavery, a far cry from its ringing endorsement ofheterosexual unions, argues Robert Gagnon, an associateprofessor of New Testament at PittsburghTheological Seminary. What kind oflegitimate analogy can be made between the two? Inmy opinion, absolutely none. Its just nightand day, he said. Moreover, whatseem like similar clashes over biblicalinterpretation can mask the role of self-interestin the debates. Southern plantationowners and the pastors they built churchesfor had a huge financial stake in theslavery debate, said Charles Irons, an assistantprofessor of church history at NorthCarolinas Elon University. Today,it is not easy to see where the financial orpolitical advantage lies in supporting oropposing gay rights, he said.Theres one final and significant  difference. Noll notes the theologicalcrisis over slavery ultimately was decidedpolitically by generals and armies.Almost everyone agrees the homosexuality debatemore likely will be settled by judges andlawmakers.###publisher:https://baptistnews.com",

Police backed by armored trucksfired tear gas to break up a large march as itreached a vital freeway in Caracas, then edgedback slightly as masked protesters pelted themwith stones. Demonstrators vowed not toflinch in their campaign to oust Maduro, despitethree weeks of protest violence that has lefteight people dead, including three onWednesday.  'Sure we're tired, but we'vegot to stand strong. I'm ready to take to thestreets every day if I have to, ' said 22-year-oldstudent protester Aquiles Aldazoro.Senior opposition leader Henrique Caprilesvowed there would be  'no surrender. '  'Itis our duty to defend the constitution, ' hesaid. Protesters blame Maduro theheir of the leftist  'Bolivarian revolution 'launched by the late Hugo Chavez in 1999  for an economic crisis marked by severe shortagesof food, medicine and basic goods.Pressure on Maduro has been mounting since2014, as falling prices for&#160;Venezuela'scrucial oil exports have sent the once-boomingeconomy into a tailspin. The crisis hasescalated since March 30,when&#160;Venezuela's Supreme Court moved toseize the powers of the legislature, the onlylever of state authority not controlled by Maduroand his allies. Hundreds of thousands ofprotesters took part in Wednesday's marches, whicherupted into clashes with security forces andarmed groups of government supporters. A17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old woman died afterthey were shot in the head, and Maduro's camp saida soldier outside Caracas was also killed.The opposition accuses Maduro of letting stateforces and gangs of armed thugs violently repressdemonstrators. Interior Minister NestorReverol said one person had been arrested for thesoldier's death, which he called a pre-meditated 'act of fascism. ' Numerous businesses anduniversities remained closed some in tacitsupport of the protests, others for fear of arepeat of the previous day's violence.Looting erupted amid the chaos Wednesday. Inthe Paradise neighborhood in western Caracas,looters carted off food and beer from a series ofransacked businesses, residents said. Inpoor neighborhoods traditionally loyal to Maduro,some protesters have cited hunger as their reasonfor joining calls for his ouster. Theescalation of&#160;Venezuela's politicalcrisis since late March has galvanized the oftendivided opposition in its efforts to force Madurofrom power. The president, in turn, hasurged his supporters, the military and civilianmilitias to defend the  'revolution. 'International concern meanwhile continues tomount. UN Secretary-General AntonioGuterres on Thursday urged all sidesin&#160;Venezuela&#160;to take steps toease tensions.  'We call for concretegestures from all parties to reduce polarizationand create the necessary conditions to address thecountrys challenges, ' he said in astatement. The European Union added tothe condemnation, calling the deaths of protesters 'highly regrettable ' and urging all sides to  'de-escalate. ' The opposition has called forthe military a pillar of Maduro's power  to abandon him. But the defenseminister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, haspledged the army's  'unconditional loyalty ' toMaduro. The president accuses theopposition of inciting a  'coup ' backed by theUnited States. According to a survey bypollster Venebarometro, seven in 10 Venezuelansdisapprove of Maduro, whose term does not enduntil 2019. The president said Wednesdaythat he is ready to face his opponents at theballot box.  'I want to have electionssoon ... to seek a peaceful path so the revolutioncan put the conspirators, murderers andinterventionist right-wingers in their place, ' hetold a rally of supporters in central Caracas.Regional elections due in December wereindefinitely postponed and there is still no datefor local polls due this year.

Undoubtedly, its at this pointduring an election year when voters are mostemotionally tied to a particular candidate.Primary elections often resemble sporting eventsmore than political contests. Butwhats alarmed me most about this particularprimary season&#160;is the number of peoplethreatening to sit out or write-in a candidate if theirparticular candidate doesnt happen to winthe nomination. A belief that I think is one ofthe most asininestances Ive ever heard. If you thinkeither Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio wouldbe better (or just as bad) as voting for eitherHillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out ofyour damn mind. I dont care whatyour thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, ontheir worst day, either candidate is a milliontimes better than anyone from the Republicanparty. And with the rights for millions ofAmericans at risk, as well as the Supreme Courtand our progress on climate change, theres too much at stakethis election to have any group of people notsupport the eventual Democratic nominee.And while I have encountered a few Clintonsupporters whove vowed not to supportSanders if he becomes the nominee (Ive evenbeen blocked by a few of them for calling themidiots), the my candidate or no one crowd is mostly foundamong Sanders supporters. Though I will gladlyadmit that the majority of those supportingSanders do&#160;understand the bigger pictureand have said they plan to support whichevercandidate ultimately wins the nomination.To those people, I cant thank themenough. In fact, I cant thank anyone enoughfor realizing whats on the line thiselection and why its so crucial that we allget out and vote blue, no matterwho. I dont even want to think abouthow much damage Republicans will be able to do tothis nation if we hand them the White House thisNovember. It will makeGeorge W. Bushs eight years seem like awonderful dream compared to the nightmare that aPresident Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon thecountry. But theres an irony toanyone who says that theyre going to taketheir ball and go home if their candidatedoesnt win, and itsthis:&#160;Neither candidate can win withouthelp from the supporters of their primaryrival. If Hillary Clinton wins thenomination, then half of all Sanders supportersdecide not to support her, shelikely&#160;loses and were stuck with aPresident Trump/Rubio/Cruz. But guesswhat? If Bernie Sanders wins thenomination, then half of all Clinton supportersdecide not to support him, heslikely&#160;going to lose and weregoing to be stuck with a PresidentTrump/Rubio/Cruz. The truth of the matteris, whether each side wants to admit it or not,they both need each other this&#160;November.Because come election day, if one group decides tolet selfish ego and pride get in the way by notsupporting the Democratic nominee, guess what?We all lose.&#160; So, no matterwhat Clinton or Sanders supporters might think ofone another, the reality is, theyre in thistogether  whether they like it or not.

But whenlawmakers start demanding thatcollege students obtain written or verbalconsent before having sex, its asign weve become a tad hysterical on thisissue.    From LA Weekly:Sounds quite unspontaneous. But a law co-authored by L.A. state Sen. Kevin de Leon wouldhave state-run college campuses establish an affirmative consent standard for itsstudents. &#160; Accordingto the language of the bill, SB 967, students whowant to have sex must essentially establish thatthere has been an affirmative, unambiguous,and conscious decision by each participant toengage in mutually agreed-upon sexualactivity. No more making sexy facesand sounds for you. Youve got to verbalize.Or get it on paper. Why not just requirea notarized letter from an attorney, or betteryet, a license? If were going to go thisfar, maybe college kids who want to have sexshould go to a DMV-like office to getpermission.  All joking aside, thefact that this is even an issue suggests that alot of college kids are having sex theyrenot comfortable with having. People dontsign a waiver when theyre engaging in anyactivity with someone they know and trust. (Myadvice to college kids: if you feel like you needto have a written contract drawn up with your partner, you shouldnt behaving sex with them.)&#160; Some ofthe colleges under investigation right now formishandling sexual assault cases are the mostliberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutionsin America. They host extravagant SexWeek events and pass out condoms tofreshmen. They talk a lot about consent, but very little aboutrespect, caring, or good judgment. Plying a yes out of someone is all thatmatters. In an environment like this, theboundaries of consent begin to break down.Students who face enormous peer pressure toparticipate in this free-for-all havetrouble saying no when they want to.Other students simply dont respect a no. Add a huge amount of alcoholinto the mix, and chaos ensues. This is the problem that college administratorsand lawmakers are trying to fix. But until theyhave the guts to criticize the culture on collegecampuses, theyll get nowhere. ###publisher:http://thepoliticalinsider.com",

The reliance on emergency care remainsstronger than ever, said Michael Gerardi,MD, president of the American College of EmergencyPhysicians,&#160;in a statement. Its the only place thats open24/7, and we never turn anyone away. The college invited 24,427 member physicians tocomplete the poll, 2099 of whom did, for aresponse rate of approximately 9%. The poll wasconducted to gauge changes in ED patient volumeand care since the Affordable Care Act went intoeffect. With the implementation of theACA, 47% of emergency physicians reported a slightincrease in the number of patients, and 28%reported significant increases in patientvolume. 56% of emergencyphysicians&#160;reported an increase in thenumber of Medicare patients, and 70% fear their EDis not sufficiently prepared for an increase inpatient volume. Despite theseconcerns,&#160;83% have concerns about effortsbeing made by hospitals to reduce emergencyvisits; specifically, that patients will putoff&#160;medical care or&#160;utilizefacilities with less/poorer resources. There is strong evidence that Medicaidaccess to primary care and specialty care is nottimely, leaving Medicaid patients with few optionsother than the [ED], said&#160;OrleePanitch, MD, chair of the Emergency MedicineAction Fund, which&#160;ordered the poll. In addition, states with punitivepolicies toward Medicaid patients in the [ED] maybe discouraging low-income patients with seriousmedical conditions from seeking necessary care,which is dangerous and wrong. Panitchcontinued. Dr Gerardi cited concernsabout&#160;the closure of hospitals andemergency care facilities&#160;in states thathave not expanded Medicaid. Hospitals received less Medicare fundingfor charity care when the [Affordable Care Act]took effect, because more people were supposed tohave health insurance coverage, saidGerardi. But in states that didntexpand Medicaid, hospitals are hurting. Forexample, the closure of a hospital in Baton Rougeresulted in a crisis for another hospital thatinherited all the patients, many of whom areuninsured, and now this hospital may close aswell. The average reimbursement for a Medicaidpatient in the [ED] is about $43.00, butits much lower in many states. &#160; Perhaps most alarmingly,34 of the physicians polled&#160;haveconsidered leaving the profession.&#160; ###publisher:http://natmonitor.com",

(Loracco viaWikimedia Commons) This Creative Commons-licensed piece first appeared at Climate News Network.PARIS - Big Oil (and its gas and coalcounterparts) could before long face paying forthe carbon contained in the fuel they sell. Twogroups working for a cleaner future want to see alevy imposed on fossil fuel exploitation.  A 2013 report said almost two-thirds ofthe main greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere,carbon dioxide, came from the fuels produced by amere 90 companies. The UN Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCCC) summit here is in thefinal hours of its attempt to broker a just andeffective global treaty on reducing thoseemissions and limiting their impacts: extremeweather, drought, flooding, sea level rise, landand forest degradation, desertification.Pressure is growing to work out if and howthese big fossil fuel producers can be heldfinancially responsible for the damage theirproducts are causing. The 90 fossil fuelcompanies responsible for 63% of CO2 emissionsfrom human activities are a roll call of householdnames, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, SaudiAramco, BP, Gazprom and Shell. Now theClimate Justice Programme and the Heinrich BoellFoundation are urging that producers should pay acarbon levy on all fossil fuel extraction andmining, with the proceeds going to help pay poorercountries for adapting to climate change andmeeting the costs of its impacts. Phase-out needed The levy would be applied toboth the exploitation and the burning of fossilfuels. If a company was involved in both, it wouldhave to pay the levy only once. It wouldcharge the carbon majors US$2 for every tonne ofcarbon dioxide their products release into theatmosphere. In 2014 this would have meant $50billion coming from the companies. Thelevy is based on a calculation of how much CO2 isreleased on average from burning a barrel of crudeoil (or a tonne of coal, or a cubic metre ofnatural gas). The CO2 footprint of the drilling ormining itself would not be taken into account. 'We propose that a global fossil fuelextraction levy be established and paid into theinternational Loss and Damage Mechanism. Thisfunding would be used to assist the poorest andmost vulnerable communities suffering the worstimpacts of climate change ', said Julie-AnneRichards of the Climate Justice Programme.  'Thislevy needs to be part of a general phase-out offossil fuels. ' Precedents TheUNFCCC's Loss and Damage Mechanism emerged fromthe 2013 climate summit in Warsaw. It is a way toaddress those climate impacts to which it isimpossible to adapt, including extreme events. 'Climate finance is already inadequate - with ahuge gap between what is needed and what is beingoffered. A new source of finance from a levy onBig Oil, Coal and Gas could unlock some of theobjections by rich countries to including loss anddamage in a new Paris agreement ', said Lili Fuhrfrom the Heinrich Boell Foundation. TheClimate Justice Programme is convinced thatexisting international law, in particular thepolluter pays principle, the no harm rule and theright to compensation support such a system. 'Our proposal draws from precedents such as theInternational Oil Pollution Compensation Funds,the oil spill compensation regime which collectslevies from companies that ship oilinternationally which are used as compensationafter oil spills ', said Julie-Anne Richards.The fossil fuel industry has so far given noreaction to the levy proposal.

She said the person they were reallylooking for was in an adjacent building.Nevertheless, she attempted to tell the policethat she had an 18-month old child sleeping in thebedroom.

Franciscelebrated Mass under chilly, 8-degree Celsius(46F) skies in the Malmo sports stadium, packedwith Nordic Catholics as well as immigrants fromthe Philippines and beyond for the final event ofhis overnight trip to southern Sweden. OnMonday, Francis and the heads of the LutheranWorld Federation commemorated MartinLuthers revolt against the abuses of theCatholic Church, praying together for forgivenessat Lunds cathedral. They signed a jointdeclaration pledging to put the errors of the pastbehind them and pursue theological talks with thegoal of letting Lutherans and Catholics share inthe Eucharist. ADVERTISEMENT Inhis homily Tuesday, Francis continued with thetheme of unity, urging the faithful to meekly drawclose to Christ and one another as theycommemorate the Reformation over the nextyear. Meekness, he said, enablesus to set aside everything that divides andestranges us, and to find ever new ways to advancealong the path of unity.  Blessed are those who pray and work forfull communion between Christians, the popesaid. It was one of the new Beatitudes,or biblical prayers, that he proposed at Mass.Other blessed: those who are close to themarginalized, who protect the environment, whohelp others. Blessed are those whoremain faithful while enduring evils inflicted onthem by others, and forgive them from theirheart, he said. The ProtestantReformation started in 1517 after Luther nailed 95theses on the church door in the town ofWittenberg, Germany, denouncing what he saw as theabuses of the Catholic Church, especially the saleof indulgences. As Protestantism spread,religious wars erupted, dividing westernChristianity in a schism that resulted in hundredsof years of violence, persecution anddiscrimination. As a result, thepopes visit to Sweden to start the yearlongProtestant anniversary raised eyebrows. But theVatican and Lutheran church both insisted theevent was no celebration but rather a solemncommemoration to ask forgiveness for the divisionand rejoice that relations have improved.ADVERTISEMENT Francis addedTuesdays Mass in at the last minute afterSwedens tiny Catholic community protestedthat Francis was ignoring them and coming only forthe Protestant commemoration.

In NewMexico, 19 percent of students who took the ACTmet the benchmarks in all four areas, up from 17percent last year. Students were most successfulin English, with 56 percent meeting thatbenchmark, and they struggled most in science,with just 29 percent hitting the target score.However, the science percentage saw the mostimprovement over last year, when 22 percent hitthe benchmark. Students slipped on the readingportion of the test, from 45 percent hitting thetarget in 2012 to 38 percent this year. The othersubjects were relatively flat. Overall,70 percent of New Mexico graduates take the ACT,and their average composite score is 19.9.Thats one point below the national averagescore of 20.9. ADVERTISEMENT Theracial and ethnic breakdown of ACT-takers remainedrelatively unchanged over last year, at 51 percentHispanic, 28 percent Anglo and 9 percent AmericanIndian. That breakdown has changed significantlyover the past five years, with the percentage ofHispanic test-takers increasing from 36 percent in2009 to 51 percent in 2013. But eventhough Hispanic students now take the test ingreater numbers than their Anglo counterparts,there is still a yawning gap between the scores ofAnglo and Hispanic students. While 50 percent ofAnglo students met three or more of the collegereadiness benchmarks, 22 percent of Hispanicstudents reached three or more of the targets.That gap has remained unchanged since at least2009.

First the British Empire swept in and tried toconquer the land, only to be driven out in thedeadliest massacre of British soldiers in theempire's history. Then the Soviet Union invaded,only to be driven out by determined, andU.S.-backed, resistance. A short timelater, the Soviet Union collapsed. Though it wasmuch longer, the British Empire also waned in theyears after the Afghanistan disaster.Now, a new book highlights that first attemptto intervene in Afghanistan, to protect itsvaluable possessions in India. The bookis called The Dark Defile: BritainsCatastrophic Invasion of Afghanistan, 1838-1842. 'It did not end well for Britain. Modernreaders may find it interesting how some of theissues that faced the Brits back then haveparallels today. Author Diana Prestonsaid after a relatively easy and successfulinitial invasion, beginning in 1838, a morefriendly regime was installed. But thenew regime struggled to win popularity; it wasseen as dependent on foreign military power forits position. Plus, its corruption alienated many,its armed forces were weak and of dubious loyaltyand it was unable to manage complex tribalrelationships. Not at all unlike theregime of Hamid Karzai, who the U.S. installed asleader shortly after its invasion. TheAfghans rebelled and forced the British to retreatfrom Kabul in winter 1841-1842. Despite promisesof safe passage, the 4,500-man army was massacred,along with its support staff and even thesoldiers wives and children. More than16,000 perished in the dark defileson the road back to India. Only oneBritish man escaped and made it to the U.S. baseat Jalalabad, Dr. William Brydon, TheBritish returned to Kabul in the summer of 1842 toexact retribution and rescue the British andIndians who had been taken prisoner.

Jerry Brown is expected to sign theCalifornia Values Act,&#160; passed&#160;by lawmakersSaturday, which would make the state a sanctuary state with new protectionsfor undocumented immigrants. The 27-11vote, along party lines, was reached after lengthynegotiations. But immigrant rights groupsapplauded the final bill, noting that itrepresented a strong rebuke of President DonaldTrumps anti-immigration agenda, includingthe Justice Departments&#160; threats&#160;towithhold law enforcement grants from sanctuarycities. This was a hard-foughteffort but the end product was worth thefight, said Jennie Pasquarella,Immigrants Rights Director with the ACLU ofCalifornia. With SB 54, California willmeaningfully improve state law to keep familiestogether and communities whole and not amoment too soon as the Trump administrationcontinues its draconian and indiscriminatecrackdown on immigrants. Under thelaw, state and local law enforcement officers willnot be permitted to ask about a personsimmigration status during an arrest or policestop, and their communication with federalimmigration authorities will be limited.  The bill also gives protections to inmateswho are immigrants, allowing them to reduce theirsentences by completing educational orrehabilitation programs, and ensures that schools,hospitals, libraries, and courthouses remain safespaces for undocumented immigrants. Theoriginal proposal by Democratic state senatorKevin De Leon would have also prohibited state andlocal police from reporting undocumentedimmigrants to federal authorities unless they hadcommitted violent or serious crimes. Thebill that is headed to Browns desk allowscommunication with Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE) regarding anyone who hascommitted any of the 800 crimes listed in theCalifornia Trust Law, which includes somemisdemeanors and non-violent crimes. ICE agentswill also still be able to enter county jails.Even after the negotiations, the bill is themost ambitious of its kind; in 1987 Oregon passeda law barring state and local officers fromdetaining anyone solely on immigration charges,and state lawmakers have proposed&#160; strengthening&#160;thatlaw this year with amendments similar to themeasures introduced in California.Proponents of the California Values Act citedresidents fear of law enforcement amid thelooming threat of deportation as a vital reason topass the bill. Now, more thanever, it is imperative that California law clearlydistinguish state and local law enforcementofficers from federal deportation agents, said Pasquarella. At a time when policedata indicates that domestic violence and sexualassault reporting is plummeting among Latinos,California has a moral obligation to ensure lawenforcement agents treat everyone fairly, nomatter their background, what they look like, orwhere they are born. ###publisher:https://truthdig.com",

Not only doesTrump believe that corporations are too heavilytaxed, but he also believes that they are tooheavily regulated. Not only does Trump opposethings such as environmental protections, he alsoapparently believes that corporations should beallowed to take bribes from foreign officials.In a piece entitled Rex Tillerson&#160;atthe Breaking Point,&#160;The New Yorker recountedan incident early onin Trumps presidency where the presidentcomplained about laws forbidding U.S. companiesfrom taking bribes. Trump argued that the law madeU.S. businesses less competitive. TrumpsSecretary of State, and former ExxonMobil CEO, hada different point of view, arguing thataccepting&#160;bribes would only weaken thestanding of these companies.  Tillerson disagreed. When he was anexecutive with Exxon, he told Trump, he once metwith senior officials in Yemen to discuss a deal.At the meeting, Yemens oil minister handedhim his business card. On the back was written anaccount number at a Swiss bank. Fivemillion dollars, the minister told him.   I dont do that, Tillerson said. Exxon doesnt dothat. If the Yemenis wanted Exxon on thedeal, he said, theyd have to play straight.A month later, the Yemenis assented. Tillerson told Trump that Americadidnt need to pay bribes that wecould bring the world up to our ownstandards, a source with knowledge of theexchange told me. Prior tobecoming president, Trump managed a largeinternational business, so it is likely he hasdealt with these laws before. It is more than abit troubling that one of Trumps biggestconcerns while in the Oval Office is making iteasier for corporations to take bribes.The rest of the article detailsTillersons history and discusses the recenttensions between himself and Trump. One of themost notable examples is the fact that Tillersonallegedly referred to Trump as a moron.

First Id like toexpress an opinion that probably will not be verypopular but which oozes with truth. In the early60s when I was recording, recordswere thought of as a tool to help promote liveperformances. The live performances were the mainrevenue stream and the records were justpromotional tools to get people to come see theshows. Somewhere this mode of thinking got turnedupside down. Consequently in years hence, recordcompanies, producers, et. all, have maderecordings, hoping to profit from the sale ofthose recordings alone, regardless of whether ornot the artist could ever pull it off live. Thisdid some things to the music business thatwerent very healthy. First it madeavailable to the general public, music of artistswho may or may not be good live performers; almostanyone can make a good recording with enough cut-ins and loops. And it made music by groupsof players who never ever intended to perform thatmusic live, and who may or may not have ever beenable to get along with each other long enough toreally sustain any kind of a road show.Music is meant to be played for the enjoymentof the audiences. For instance, if I go into thestudio with an acoustic guitar and simultaneouslyplay and sing on a recording, people would come tosee me perform in that same mode; I.e. playingguitar and singing as a solo act. I dontthink they would come to see me expecting a fullband. Conversely, if I advertised a Nightwith Louie Louie people would comeexpecting to see a rock band that they could danceto, and would be quite disappointed if I showed upwith just my acoustic guitar. Thesuggestions that recordings are produced todayjust to sell recorded music is all backwards andthe sooner the record companies and producers andartists figure this out the sooner they will allquit sniveling over the fact that the entire worldis freely sharing their music digitally andisnt willing to stop; and in fact will doanything to circumvent their efforts to get paidfor the recordings alone. The days ofproducers and musicians putting bands togetherjust to get a recording deal so they can get paidby the record company for a product that usuallynever even gets released; those days are over.Its time record companies went back totheir roots and became what they started out tobe; entities who record working acts in orderto 1) capture the performance forposterity, and 2) make a promotional toolto get audiences to the next show. Thesolution is to give the world all the free musicit wants, but to give the recording entity,whether it be a record company or a producer, orwhomever, a cut of every live performance. Thatwill do at least two things and maybe more that Ihavent even thought about yet. First itwill give everyone involved in the recordings asource of revenue (pay day) for all their hardwork of producing and promoting the recordings.Second, it will weed out all the so-called recording artists whocouldnt, in a live venue, perform their wayout of a paper bag. In a down economy the publiccraves live entertainment, so what better time toget back to basics. The timing couldnt bebetter for a profitable turn around. So now is thetime to get it going. I send you thesethoughts in hopes that just maybe a new/oldperspective on the subject of recorded music canbe presented to the entire recording world andthey can all start making a real profit.JACK ELY, the former lead singer of TheKingsmen, is a veteran horse trainer.

The company said it was introducing a newmetric to fix the problem. Some ad agencyexecutives who were also informed by Facebookabout the change started digging deeper, promptingFacebook to give them a more detailed account, oneof the people familiar with the situationsaid. Ad buying agency Publicis Media wastold by Facebook that the earlier counting methodlikely overestimated average time spent watchingvideos by between 60% and 80%, according to a lateAugust letter Publicis Media sent to clients thatwas reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.A spokeswoman for Publicis Media, a division ofPublicis Groupe SA, referred calls to Facebook.Publicis was responsible for purchasing roughly$77 billion in ads on behalf of marketers aroundthe world in 2015, according to estimates fromresearch firm RECMA. GroupM, the adbuying unit of WPP Plc, also was notified of thediscrepancy by Facebook, another person familiarwith the matter said. Advertisement 'We recently discovered an error in the way wecalculate one of our video metrics, ' Facebook saidin a statement.  'This error has been fixed, it didnot impact billing, and we have notified ourpartners both through our product dashboards andvia sales and publisher outreach. We also renamedthe metric to make it clearer what we measure.This metric is one of many our partners use toassess their video campaigns. ' The newsis an embarrassment for Facebook, which has beentouting the rapid growth of video consumptionacross its platform in recent years. Dueto the miscalculated data, marketers may havemisjudged the performance of video advertisingthey have purchased from Facebook over the pasttwo years. It also may have impacted theirdecisions about how much to spend on Facebookvideo versus other video ad sellers such asGoogle's YouTube, Twitter, and even TVnetworks. Media companies and publishersare affected, too, since they've been giveninaccurate data about the consumption of theirvideo content across the social network. Many usethat information to help determine the types ofcontent they post. For the past two yearsFacebook only counted video views of more thanthree seconds when calculating its  'AverageDuration of Video Viewed ' metric. Video views ofunder three seconds were not factored in, therebyinflating the average. Facebook's new metric, 'Average Watch Time ', will reflect video views ofany duration. That will replace the earliermetric. In its note to clients, Publicissaid the change was an attempt to obfuscateFacebook's earlier miscalculations.  'Inan effort to distance themselves from theincorrect metrics, Facebook is deprecating [theold metrics] and introducing 'new' metrics inSeptember. Essentially, they're coming up with newnames for what they were meant to measure in thefirst place, ' the memo said. Themiscounting could also fuel concerns amongadvertisers and media companies about the so-called  'walled gardens ' that companies includingFacebook and Google are often described asoperating. Both companies keep a tight grip ondata, and only allow limited third-party trackingfirms to plug into their systems. KeithWeed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, said inan interview last year, tech companies that don'tlet third parties measure their platforms isequivalent to  'letting them mark their ownhomework. ' The Publicis note said,  'Thisonce again illuminates the absolute need to have3rd party tagging and verification on Facebook'splatform.
