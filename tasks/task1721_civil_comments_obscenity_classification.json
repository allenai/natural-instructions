I grow medical grade, sun grown cannabis for my own use and for two others who are quite ill and physically unable to participate. We produce one crop annually that fills the jars for the coming year. My patients contribute financially to offset the fixed costs of stock acquisition, soil, amendments, propagation, water, labor, drying, curing, weighing, etc.  It's production farming so I recommend getting as close to the source as possible and avoid the dispensary blues.",

The cornerstone of his plan is fairness.

PFD reform is not a good stand alone answer. The public will not abide a PFD raid; perceived or real!\n\nTo make matters worse, the Governor applauds the enemy when he needs to go right back for support to his strongest constituency, the general public and demand a better fiscal plan.\n\nThis constitutes a sad political strategy to shift the blame from the GOP, to the governor.\n\nPaybacks are a bitch",

OF course the sleazy green money grubbers don't want you to know this because the need to scare you into sending them money to pretend to solve the (non-)problem.\n\nFurthermore, growth is highly subsidized by taxpayers, and yet it never pays for itself. See: http://www.fodorandassociates.com/rpts_and_pubs.htm\nME Somehow we grew for 150 years without bankruptcy. So this is more bull crap from the anti-growth zealots. Next you'll try to convence us that we should get out of $0.25/passenger-mile cars for $1.00 per mile buses or $1.60 per passenger-mile toy trains. http://www.debunkingportland.com/top10bus.html",

You're right about that. \n\nThrough the years Wars waged by some has added millions to the numbers of people who experience physiological brain disorders like traumatic brain injury because of trauma experienced on wars' battlefields. \n\nThen there are millions of other innocent people who develop physiological brain disorders as collateral damage because they unfortunately live within a particular theater of War locale.\n\nDoesn't look like that stupidity will end anytime soon.",

They had other reasons for favoring a strong central government, but they had very little (if any) concern for the livelihoods of ordinary citizens. William Leuchtenberg's new (huge!) volume titled The American Presidency: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton will give you a good overview, if you're interested.

Hunting is also a conservation tool that is used to manage a species.

Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.\n2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.\n3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).

Many professors are chasing these dollars from students that really cannot afford the costs.
