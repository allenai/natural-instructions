Adolf Frederick never cared much for Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika had him appointed marshal at court and eventually royal governor of her son prince Gustav. Tessin was behind many amusements in the circle of the crown princess, and it was said that _he_was only too eager to please Louisa Ulrika in any way possible. There were unconfirmed rumors that Tessin was the lover of Louisa Ulrika during her tenure as crown princess. Her son Gustav III later addressed these rumors, that although Count Tessin had been in love with her, his feelings were one-sided and not answered by his mother, as a love affair with a noble contradicted the ``natural contempt'' which Louisa Ulrika herself as a royal felt for every subject, noble or not. Her circle at court included Henrika Juliana von Liewen, who immediately became her favorite among her ladies-in-waiting; the intellectual Cath*rine Charlotte De la Gardie, the scientist Eva Ekeblad, and the witty Anders Johan von H*pken. <sep>, Pronoun: he",
