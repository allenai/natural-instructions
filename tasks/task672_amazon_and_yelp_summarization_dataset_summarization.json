It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout.

My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well.

All the corners are smooth and my daughter loves it - looks great on her.I cannot say anything about the chain because used our own chain.:) Satisfied., Review_2: It look perfect in a womens neck!! great gift, I thought for the price it was going to look cheap, but I was far wrong. It look great.Spect great reward from your woman when you give this to her; D, Review_3: The prettiest sterling silver piece I own now. I get so many compliments on this necklace. I bought it for myself from my hubby for Valentine's Day. Why not? When people ask where I got it, I simply say from my loving hubby. And he is off the hook as to what to get me. win + win., Review_4: I love hearts and I love 'love':) I do not have any negative feedback, the necklace is perfect and the charm is perfect. I just thought it would have been slightly bigger. Overall, I love my new heart necklace., Review_5: When I received the package, I was surprised and amazed because the necklace is so elegant, beautiful and the same as the picture shown here. I really love this necklace. It has a unique pendant designed. I will recommend it to someone to order it now..., Review_6: Item is nice. Not a great quality item, but right for the price. Charm was larger than I expected (I expected small and elegant, but it was large and almost costume jewelry like). I think it is a good necklace, just not what I expected., Review_7: I got this as a present for my GF on Valintines day. She loves it and wears it every day! Its not cheap looking and it hasn't broken yet. The chain hasn't broken either even though it is very thin. Strongly recomend it!, Review_8: Over all service has been great the only problem, I ordered a purple Mickey Mouse case for iPhone 4S they sent a black, n I felt it was to much trouble n such a small item to send back so needless to say its put back in a drawer somewhere",

However, it fit me a bit snug to the front probably because my feet are a bit broader. And you do have to order the size a 1 / 2 inch bigger than you normally wear., Review_2: this shoe was picked by the 'bride to be' for her upcoming wedding this weekend. The other bridesmaids paid over $80.00 in a dept. store. I found my daughter 'bridesmaid' the exact same shoe for much less. The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly., Review_3: I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area., Review_4: These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable., Review_5: These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute., Review_6: I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!, Review_7: These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable., Review_8: Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for. I'm five months pregnant and needed a comfortable shoe for a wedding and these completely fit the bill. I would buy again.",

                "These chic shoes have a short heel and are perfect for weddings. They can cause pinching and blisters, but that is easy to fix by purchasing a half size larger than normal. They come in a variety of rich colors. For the quality, the price can't be beat!",
                "These women's dress shoes look nice and have vibrant colors. They have a lower heel, which gives more stability. However, they sometimes cause toe pinching and rubbing if worn to size, so ordering a half size larger may be required. These shoes are not recommended for wide feet for this reason."

Looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers.

These will fit the bill.I found this style was a little big so I had to get a half size smaller and it is great.LO, Review_3: Reviews said to buy a size smaller. I wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. It was still too big, and I'm guessing a 6 would fit. I bought the Ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. I plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6., Review_4: I always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. Way too large. Am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size., Review_5: I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. I can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. The shoes run big. I normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right., Review_6: I ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that I read, but they were still too small. They were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. The company was very good about refunding my money very quickly., Review_7: I don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. If I order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if I order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. Both pairs went back -- bummer!, Review_8: I am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. I wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. Incredibly lightweight!

I ordered a size 34 which is the size I normally wear and the suit not only pinches around my legs but also is almost uncomfortably tight around the waist., Review_2: The suit seemed ok in quality however it was the wrong size. It is always a gamble buying online even following the sizing chart. I did return it and got a refund but Amazon failed to fight for the sale and make it right. I went to a local store and purchased what I liked., Review_3: Fits well and has a nice draw string to keep them tight. I bought a size small so that I would not have to worry about them falling off but I should have bought my correct size as they fit true to size., Review_4: The only reason for the 1-star reduction, is the seams around the legs are pretty stiff and tight. However, the seams appear to be loosening up a bit though with use. I typically wear a size 32 but had to get a 34 for this suit., Review_5: The size on the waist was correct, but if you have large thighs like I do, or should I say muscular thighs, it will be a tight fit. It is very tight to get past my thighs, then it wasn't so bad. The waist was a 38, no problem there. It will be a tight fit on most guys., Review_6: I got this swimsuit a month ago. I swim 5 days a week for about an hour and 15 min. I washed the suit after every practice. It tookabout 2 weeks for a fabric to loose all elasticity. After two more weeks the suit basically fell apart. Avoid!, Review_7: I wear a 32 and I read some of the reviews and yes it does have a nice feel and fit but does run small with that being said I ordered a 34 and it was a nice fit and feel but I think a 36 would have been a better fut, Review_8: I haven't swam in it much yet but fit is good.

Run maybe a tad small in the general spectrum, but hey, remember the break in period. Look fabulous, will last me for the next twenty years.... They bridge the fashion vs. function quandary beautifully., Review_3: Every woman needs a pair of these Frye boots! Fit is true to normal size. I wear a standard 9. These fit in the shaft for any ladies who have bigger calves as I do. You have to fight to get them on first few times and they wear stiff until fully broken in. Worth the money and break in time., Review_4: Boots excellent quality, beautiful skin, a modern model. But! they are very narrow! This is the second pair of shoes is a brand and my 8.5 size fits me perfectly, even he little more than usual. But these are very narrow! go to a cobbler, let him try to stretch. Be careful!, Review_5: bought these for the wife to have something to kick around in and keep up with the kids, but she doesn't like them. Her heel lifts with every step, and they're stiff and heavy. Not an everyday casual shoe., Review_6: Don't get me wrong, they're really good boots, but they used to make them better. My last pair from a few years ago were much higher quality. Thicker sole, better full grain leather, now they only make the black in 'grease', which stains all my socks black. Keeping them, but still disappointed in Frye., Review_7: i bought it just for the heavy snow cuz my UGG got wet through.even though it is a little expensive, but the boots are nice and it was shipped to me for only two days.!!!!!! i love it, Review_8: They were comfortable the moment I put them on.

It is light enough that I can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my Kindle. I love this particular shade of blue. It goes well with most everything I wear. I also appreciate the pockets for separating things., Review_4: Took this bag on a recent trip to Europe and it was great. No worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. The two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella., Review_5: I checked this on two different monitors before I ordered. Both looked more rose color. It's very much a dark purple. Which I'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up, Review_6: Wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an AMAZING bag. I couldn't believe how much stuff I got in there on a recent trip. Comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. Love this bag., Review_7: I used this for the first time last week on a trip to Maine. We normally drive so I was worried about carrying things on the plane. This handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups.

I love it so much that I bought it in three colors., Review_2: This is a really cute shoe that feels very comfortable on my high arches. The strap on the instep fits my feet very well, but I have very slim feet. I can see how it would be uncomfortably tight on anyone with more padding on their feet., Review_3: I love these sandals. The fit is perfect for my foot, with perfect arch support. I don't think the leather is cheap, and the sandals are very comfortable to walk in. They are very pretty, and pair very well with pants and dresses., Review_4: My wife is a nurse and wears dansko shoes. We were excited to try the new crimson sandal and normally order 39 sandal and 40 closed toe. Some other reviews were right about a narrow width and tight toe box. We gave them a try and passed a great pair of shoes to our daughter with her long narrow feet, and she loves them..., Review_5: Finally, a Dansko sandal that's fashion forward! It was love at first sight! This is my 4th Dansko purchase. Their sizing, quality and comfort is very consistent. I love the stying of this sandal and I'm pleased they are offering bolder colors. Another feature I love is the Dri-Lex topsole - it's soft and keeps feet dry., Review_6: I really love these sandals. my only issue is after wearing them for a while my feet started to swell as I have a high instep and they were a little tight across the top. I'm sure they will stretch a bit after a few wears, Review_7: I have several pairs of Dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly. So I felt confident when I ordered the Tasha Sandal in size 39. I don't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small. Otherwise, I love them.

I disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. The smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. I love the design and it was a fair price. Shipping was a little expensive though. It arrived quickly and I would buy from this seller again., Review_4: I really enjoy the design of this case but I thought it would be lighter.

And lo and behold they actually work. So well that I ordered another set for a second pair of shoes., Review_2: I love this product... 100% natural AND eliminates foot odor! While it appeared to be smaller than my 8.5 shoes, the insole fits perfectly into heels, boots, flats and running shoes. Very impressed! It has worked wonders so far! Can't wait to put this product to test this summer!, Review_3: I have thick peeling, itchy skin on the bottom of one foot. I had tried everything to get rid of it. The final trick were these inserts along with slathering coconut oil mixed with athletes foot oil & oregano oil two times a day. FINALLY, normal soft feet!, Review_4: The insoles fit comfortably into my shoes. I love that they are discreet and thin. I no longer have to worry about foot odor or about my shoes stinking. I definitely can see where my shoes will have a longer life by using these insoles., Review_5: Product is OK. It doesn't seem to work as well for me as was advertised. It does serve to keep your show a little dryer, but doesn't seem to work all day for me. I wouldn't recommend it as there are other options that do the same but cost less.Ok, Review_6: Im sure if I were to put them in my tennis shoes they would probably fit perfectly. I am wearing them in my croc I have to wear for work. Thay are to thin width wise to really make a difference bc they tend to slide around., Review_7: This is a fantastic product that I would recommend to anyone who wants their feet to feel cooler, more comfortable, less sweaty and ultimately less smelly! They are so effective I use them in several pairs of shoes. I'm a very happy customer, thanks so much Zederna!, Review_8: These insoles are so thin that I can even wear them in my pumps. They look SO much nicer than odor-eaters and work way better too. I highly recommend them. I accidentally ordered a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. It was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors. Enjoy!",

                "The inserts are effective at reducing foot odor and moisture in most cases. The thin shape makes them easy to add discretely to your shoes. Depending on shoe width, the insert may slide around a bit in wider shoes but it can also easily be trimmed to fit a narrower shoe.",
                "These insoles are quite effective at eliminating foot odor and fit any style of shoe. They also wick moisture and are thin enough to be comfortable on any arch. The only drawback may be the price for more thrifty consumers."

The only thing is I didn't pay attention that this one has a wand which I don't need since I have one and it is still in very good shape. I was looking for just refills. But in any way it's easy to use and works well for us., Review_2: I love these cleaners. They are easy to use and do a great job. Some people have commented they wish they had more cleaning agent, but I think they have more than enough and often use one to clean two toilets., Review_3: I love these - most practical bathroom item created - but what is going on??? Chlorox customer service advised they have discontinued! What a huge disappointment after throwing away the old brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Review_4: These are great because they are sanitary (unlike the scrubbers that get reused everytime). I use these for one cleaning, then throw away (without having to touch anything!) Good scrubbing action, and gets the toilet good and clean., Review_5: These are great buys. They are smaller than the regular size but well big enough to clean the toilet, much more efficient, I always felt wasting when use the regular ones and now with these, work great and well worth the money., Review_6: I have been using these for a long time, what I like about them is they are disposable and you do not have to look at a stained toilet bowl brush in the corner. Clorox toilet bowl cleaners do a very nice job., Review_7: i live in a condo and only have 1 toilet that doesn't have to be cleaned every week. so this is perfect. no clutter next to the toilet with unsightly brushes and throwing the tip away after each makes cleaning the bathroom much more palatable., Review_8: Who wants to stick their hand in a toilet?

I must say I have been pleasantly surprised and my wallet thanks me. Don't get me wrong I love classic Zippo lighters however butane torches are clean burning and are great for EDC since they have almost zero odor. The torch also adjusts very nicely so you can fine tune your preference., Review_3: got for a christmas gift and i cant say how awsome this insert is i love that the fuel wont just evaporate the flames a bit big at first and had to urn screw as how the little lever wouldnt go over far enough but again no biggy awsome product i challenge you to blow this thing out, Review_4: i bought this product expecting it to last about a week, that was almost a year ago. i want to share just the facts: it plastic so don't go beating it aroundits a little small so some tape is needed to build it up and hold it in placeif you clean it right it will last for a long time, Review_5: I like carrying my classic Zippo and not tainting my cigars with lighter fluid. Much cheaper to get a Zippo and this insert than to buy a Zippo Blu. I also prefer the electric ignition to the flint wheel on the Zippo Blu., Review_6: I love the old style Zippo but was having difficulty with the standard fluid and carrying the lighter around in my pocket. This made it very convenient and it's a cool 'novelty' item. I still keep most of my Zippos original (standard insert), but it's cool to have a few of these with the 'butane' conversion kit..., Review_7: It did not fit properly. I then removed it and re-inserted original Zippo insert. To my dismay, cap of Zippo no longer closed properly. (Apparently, attempting to get the Thunderbird insert into the Zippo and close the cap caused the hinge to deform, rendering the Zippo unusable). Disappointing, to say the least!, Review_8: Thank God I found this. It works on Butane, and it will hold fuel longer than a week. Stupid Zippo, with their flints, and their packing, and their wicks.

                "This butane powered Zippo lighter boasts an electric ignition functions better than Zippo's traditional flint wheel. The size of the flame is easily adjustable with the turn of a screw, so excess butane is not wasted based on the consumers preference. The only drawback is that it may not fit some lighter cases.",
                "This lighter insert fits inside a traditional Zippo case but doesn't use lighter fluid. It lasts longer than a traditional insert and costs less. It looks like a Zippo but works better and uses butane. The ignition is electric, not flint, and the flame can withstand wind without being blown out. Overall this lighter insert is recommended."

If I pass away due to coronary disease, I'll consider lowering my rating of it but I'll still have appreciated its burp-lessness., Review_3: i've tried the nature made original Fish Oil before and i didn't like the fishy smell and sometimes bad burp after taste... But this Burp-less version is really better as i haven't burped and it has no fishy smell... I'm switching to this one permanently.., Review_4: My husband takes 4 per day - I take 2. The price on Subcribe & Save is good. The product is consistant high quality, delivered same time each month and I don't have to go to the store to find the shelf empty. Product is worth the purchase. I know I will get the same product every month and its a good product, Review_5: I couldn't handle the burping up of fish smell that other fish oil gels came with. And preferred not to use the liquid version. This gel is great. I been using it for months now--and not one burp!:), Review_6: If you are like me I like sushi but I couldnt stand the constant taste of it when I was taking regular fish oil and krill oil pills, this is why I stopped taking them. the directions said to drink a lot of water when taking them and I did but it didnt matter. I love this fish oil it does what it says.., Review_7: I have been using Nature Made products for years. I feel Amazon offers them at a great price. These Fish Oil caps are the burp less variety which I would recommend to others if you take Fish Oil daily as I do. I would order them again. Also received them within a few days., Review_8: For anyone like myself who uses Omega 3 Fish oil on a regular basis, I recommend this product.

No fillers, and no artificial flavoring, excellent packaging, and a quality product., Review_6: I am not pleased with this product.

I have noticed that I have better results from the Calms magnesium than taking double the dose of this product.

It includes information on conditions, atmosphere, diameter, and the duration of each planets 'day' and 'year'. It covered all the basic information we needed, and it is beautiful., Review_2: Pretty happy with the poster for something to teach my son when he grows up about just how small our world actually is compared to the other planets that are out there.Overall good quality and looks pretty good up on the wall.Big enough to catch someones eye and clear enough to tell which planet is which., Review_3: This poster is a few years out of date - still lists Pluto as a planet - but man, the artwork on it is awesome. I also love the inset map that shows the planets' sizes to scale. It's probably not good for a classroom due to its age, but for a bedroom or general decoration, it's great., Review_4: My son said 'Wow, this is great!' He's only 4 years but he's enjoying learning about the solar system. Each planet has an informative summary. Great service! Will be framing the poster for his room. Love it!!, Review_5: Its a great poster! Bought at a huge discount. Only thing is I thought the description said laminated. It was not, its a standard poster. But its perfect for what I needed it for. Now I just have to get a frame for it: D, Review_6: I could not have been more disappointed in my purchase! The picture and size was perfect but there were so many wrinkles it looked terrible. I took it to a professional framer and even using there equipment the wrinkles remained. When I bought the poster it was supposed to be brand new. I was really ripped off and may never order from Amazon again., Review_7: It's a bit dated, and if your not sitting directly by it, it's a bit hard to read. The poster is nice though. We didn't get a frame just hung it on the wall for homeschooling, we like it a lot!, Review_8: The item arrived on time and my son loves it. It's posted on the side wall next to his bed.

The poster lists Pluto still with its planetary status intact which is no longer the case. It's a plain poster and needs to be framed to if it's to be used as art.  If this poster is needed for its aesthetic qualities, it's recommended, but if it's needed as a teaching tool, it is not recommended.",

If you need a handy storage containter and want it to look great on your counter top this is what you want!, Review_4: For some reason the crock shows to be taller and slimmer in THIS COLOR, but it's not. It's the wider and slightly shorter one I wanted. It's very pretty. Plenty room for everything, including the utinsils with the larger rubber handles., Review_5: This crock is very large and gives you plenty of room for utensils (especially now that many utensils have the thick rubber handles). I was able to condense from 2 drawers to 1 now that I have this crock on the counter. Seems very high quality and looks beautiful., Review_6: Tired of fighting to get my cooking utensils out of another type of vessel Le Creuset proves once again to be my top choice in the kitchen. This crock gives plenty of space for over a dozen everyday utensils, looks perfect on the counter and is not too large getting in the way of work space. The white color is classic for any decor., Review_7: I LOVE this utensil crock! Le Creuset has never let me down and the color is just fabulous. By being larger than expected, I was delighted to find that ALL my cooking tools fit, with room to spare. Its a perfect addition to my kitchen, and its a magnificent color., Review_8: I love the color and it fits in with other pieces that I have. It is a good size for holding items.

Could be better for wall to wall carpeting but there are more expensive Miele vacuums for that purpose. Like that it has special filters to remove allergens from air and love that it is so lightweight., Review_3: Too bad there isn't a way to rate this higher 'cause I would. Very quite. A little pricey, but you get a quality product for your money. Wife likes it, and has vacuumed more than she used to with the old vacuum it's so much easier to use. And did I mention quiet?, Review_4: I moved from a house that had a cental vacuum system. I was concerned about how happy I would be with a separate vacuum cleaner (not central system). I love my new Miele vacuum cleaner! It is stronger than my central vacuum for me! Pathetic canister moves with ease and the retractable ford is great. Love this system!!!!, Review_5: From the get go, this vacuum is a keeper. It is super quiet yet has the suction power of a shop-vac. The vacuum is simple to use and lightweight. Our only issue was that the box was very damaged upon receipt, but there is no apparent damage to the machine. Concerning that it would even be shipped due to the box damage., Review_6: It really sucks. What do I mean. Well, first, it really does a great job of sucking up dirt, always a good ability for a vacuum cleaner. It also sucks because the replacement bags are pricey and need to be changed out every other month in our cat and child-filled household., Review_7: Very high quality vacuum. Read the reviews before you buy. The old reliable names are no longer the same quality. Miele is one of the best. You get what you pay for. Thanks Amazon for making my choices easier to research and purchase., Review_8: I can't believe we went so long without the Miele!

It is so easy to use and the veggie and fish tasted so much better! I think this will help me to stick to my weight loss goal by keeping me full eating more veggies., Review_7: As previously reviewed, this steamer is not overly sized.

Perfect example of 'you get what you pay for'. >: (, Review_2: This fan takes up very little space and is pretty quiet. Since it's fairly tall, it can blow in your face when you're sitting down. It would be nice to be able to change the degree of oscillation, but that's not a huge deal., Review_3: I've had this for two months now, and I've noticed that it feels like there's only air coming out of one side. Bummer. Not sure what could be the problem, but it's too late to return it. Wouldn't recommend., Review_4: It's not that powerful unless you are all of a few inches from it. It wobbles a bit and after a few weeks of use it starts to squeak if you use the oscillating setting. I wish I wouldn't have cheaped out and bought a better more expensive fan., Review_5: This fan is pretty noisy in my sons small bedroom but I only really put it on the lowest setting so it's no big deal. What bothers me about it is that the fan blows out to the side of the vents rather than in the middle so I have to really play with it to aim it properly., Review_6: This fan is a horrible purchase. It doesn't blow air straight ahead. You have to turn the fan at an angle to feel any wind AND only if on high and within 24 inches. It was such a waste of money, I now have to buy another fan., Review_7: This tower fan is the right size, the right color. But the air flows from the side of the vent not from the full vent. You have to turn the fan almost to the wall to get the benefit of the fan. I would not recommend this fan., Review_8: My fan arrived with an out of balance blade assembly and had to be returned.

The hat is thin, but completes the outfit. And the candy pocket is huge. Perfect! I'm so glad we bought this costume over any other Thomas costume., Review_2: I ordered this for my 3 yr old for Halloween. He loved it!! The candy catcher in the front is really neat, but probably need to take a pail or something else along also because it can get to be heavy if they get a lot of candy. I was very pleased with the way it fit and everything., Review_3: Received from Toynk Toys and was very disappointed when I opened the pkg...... very flimsy felt fabric. No 3D sculpted face that I expected. I became creative and added huge googly eyes, pumpkin patch, spiders, bats, and train tracks to the outfit to make it a bit more suitable for my taste., Review_4: This is a cute costume that we got for my lil cousin and the candy pouch is basically the size of the entire costume so that's p cool. I doubt it would fit up to six years old like it's advertised as, but it's the perfect size for him (age 2), Review_5: My son looked sooooo cute with this costume on. It was well worth the price in my opinion because, his face light up when he seen it in the package. The whole night he kept saying to the doors he got candy from 'me the train, chuchu!!', Review_6: I ordered this costume online and it was perfect for my 20 month old son's second Halloween. It was comfortable and he loved the pocket. The size was perfect because it didn't need to be a particular fit. He loved the hat too. Every house we went to trick or treat complimented the outfit too., Review_7: My 2 year old loved this costume. He went on the Halloween parade at school and everyone said it was very creative that he has his own candy pouch as part of his costume. He also went around the neighborhood and was pretty popular with his Thomas the train look., Review_8: I was pleasantly surprised at how cute this costume is in person. My 3 year old son LOVED being Thomas for Halloween, and the candy catcher was a great feature. It also looks like it will grow with him, so we may use it again for Halloween next year if he's still Thomas-obsessed!",

                "What an impressive Thomas the Train costume! It will fit any train loving toddler for at least a few Halloween seasons due to its roomy design. The candy pocket on the front is an adorable touch. And it's so stinkin' cute! Absolutely worth the price.",
                "A perfect Thomas Halloween costume, complete with an over-sized candy holding pouch. With plenty of room, this costume fits best for children 20 months to 3 years of age. It may even allow for multiple Halloween uses. The fabric is a little thin but overall, perfect quality for a Halloween costume. Kids absolutely love it!",
                "This Thomas the Tank costume is perfect for small children. It fits most children up to five or six years old, and could even be used multiple times as the child grows. It has a handy pouch on the front that holds a large load of candy. The costume is highly recommended."

It would benefit from some indication of the percentage charge of the battery. Also, the LED light is VERY bright., Review_2: The product is great .The issue is that it came broken and I only found out after I had it for a month. There is no was to call there support. Very very bad idea. Will do more research next time .I don't think I would buy it again!!!!, Review_3: I bought this to test it out for charging my phone on AT section hikes. For the added weight, it was a nice-to-have item. I probably wouldn't have it on a through-hike, but it worked well and if you aren't going to have access to a power source for recharging your phone while you're out, it does the job pretty well., Review_4: This solar charger works perfectly. It can be charged with electricity or solar power making it a great backup for charging devices. For its size I would recommend getting one and putting it in your but out bag for use with e-devices., Review_5: I ordered this charger to take on safari to South Africa. It is suppose to charge an iPhone and Kindles. It doesn't work with either of mine. It was a waste of money for me. I'm very disappointed., Review_6: Charges up, charges your devices. The flashlight is really bright. I had to take a star off because the charge battery doesn't hold a charge over a period of time. However don't go cheap, this product is worth the money., Review_7: This is my first solar charger, so I can't compare it to any others. I will say that the flashlight is extremely bright as noted by others. It seems to do a nice job charging my Droid Bionic but it didn't seem to work on the Kindle Fire., Review_8: I left it out for 24 hours in direct sun, the lights on the side showing the progress of charging blindly blinked, but the charge gave my iPod only 1 / 10 of full battery. I tried again and placed it in the sun for 2 sunny days straight, again, after multiple annoying blinking signals, it did not charge anything. Returned.",

The LED flashlight is too bright  and there is no accurate display of charge level.

I tried changing the settings to improve the image quality, but had no luck. The company ArcSoft charges $10.00 per phone call for tech support. You are better off making the investment on a nicer quality scanner., Review_2: * * Not Reccommended * * Purchased as a gift in August. Opened a week ago. Spent the last week trying to get Win Xp to recognise the Vu Point scanner. Many drivers and reloads later all I have is a little black box with a red light and a message from windows that says 'USB Device Not Recognised'., Review_3: I used the VuPoint Digital Scanner to scan over 1,200 35 mm negatives and about a dozen slides and found this gadget a most user-friendly and efficient tool. I even managed to upload a few black and white negatives from 1963. I recommend the product highly., Review_4: While the software was good for Windows XP and Vista, I now have Windows 7 and would like to have software for the newer operating system. The company prefers to sell other products rather than update their software. I can't see recommending this product in today's market., Review_5: While most equipment will work with more modern versions of Windows than were available when manufactured this is not true with this scanner. Requires Windows XP means it won't work with earlier OR LATER. Its on its way back for a refund., Review_6: I found the VuPoint scanner not acceptable and I am still waiting for a replacement. My contacts with VuPoint were helpful but the equipment still did not produce acceptable images. My contact with the seller has been sporadic, at best, and a replacement unit has not been delivered.I an NOT anxious to deal with these providers again., Review_7: Product is very easy to use. Does a great job converting my slide and photo negatives to digital format. Touch-up and enhance program gave me just what I needed to clean up and enhance some of the scans, Company was great to work with!!, Review_8: Its not worth the time it takes to get the negative to fit in the holders they give you. I'd much rather buy a hp flat bed scanner that lets you see the final photo image and not just an image of the negative. It takes to much time and isn't worth the money.",

It protects my new SLR camera and I can still put water bottles on the side, food and a jacket inside. Additionally, it is very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it., Review_2: I have this same model purchased from B & H. This one through Amazon is missing any sort of padding at the bottom of the bag. Basically your camera is sitting right on the ground with a thin layer in between it and any surface. Ridiculous and disappointing., Review_3: The main clasp for the bottom part isn't perfect... it's slightly bent and requires some manipulation to 'click.' The tripod's great, the cleaning kit's great. Be careful about that front clasp. It was shipped quickly though., Review_4: I like this bag very much, it can hold my SLR body along with 2 lens, even with one 70-300mm, although bit hard to fit in well. I would expect it little bit bigger, however current size looks perfect if carry out for causal travel. And the bag is good quality and solid. Nice backpack., Review_5: I found that this was too small for my D90, 70-300mm and 18-105mm. While it all fit in the bottom of the backpack, there was really no room to spare for future equipment. I wanted to use the top for personal stuff, so that I did not want to put camera equipment up there., Review_6: I recently bought Tamrac Adventure 7 backpack for my Nikon D80, and I used it during my vacation trip. I like it very much. It is well designed, the material made is durable, and practical pockets to put your camera accessories. I recommend this backpack. You'll get your money's worth., Review_7: I had at least two camera bags before this one, and never found the perfect fit.What can I say... I just LOVE this backpack, is comfortable, excellent size and does not look as if you were bringing a super camera.I would buy it again and strongly recommend this model, Review_8: Great Backpack!

Hwever his was my first time purchasing the 100 pk from Amazon, but so far so good., Review_3: I have had a ton a problems with these discs. After about 30 minutes of a DVD, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. Looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and I guess picked again. Do not recommend., Review_4: The box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank DVD in place was broken and DVD were off the spindle. If that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all., Review_5: Produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on DVD players. The first half was about what I expected, a few coasters, a couple minor errors. The second half I was lucky to get maybe 5 that worked flawlessly. No good!, Review_6: After receiving this DVD + R, I think I should order the 50 piece spindle. I did not burn too often. I believe it is enough for 2 years. I tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it., Review_7: Been purchasing only HP DVD + R media for 8 years or more. Always got the HP branded gold coated. Made by CMC, with id of CMCMAGM01001. This batch is not gold as portrayed in the photo, it's silver coated, but still the same id., Review_8: Vendor describes the product as being gold in color. It is not it is silver.

Would have loved to have a bigger display screen, or one with swiveling capability. Adequate flash for indoor and night shot settings. Sturdy and slips easily into pocket., Review_3: I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA BASED ON CONSUMER REPORTS REVIEW. IT HAS MET MOST OF THE REQUIERMENTS.

But I was able to enjoy my 5 day / 4 night cruise, as long as I left one of these in my mouth to dissolve. I even slept with one! I highly recommend this product., Review_3: I brought this along my 7 night cruise trip - works great even though I tend to forget taking it until I already feel the motion sickness. My cruise happened to meet some heavy showers and I felt no dizziness or sickness except the constant waving feeling:) Definitely will bring it along next time I go to cruise again or plan to ride roller coasters., Review_4: This is my favorite type of motion sick medicine. It doesn't make me drowsy and it works well. The chewable tablets don't taste too bad and I'd rather chew a tablet than swallow one whole anyway. Great product!, Review_5: I've been taking this medicine since I was a little one and it works great! I get motion sickness so easily, but if I take one Bonine, I don't get sick! I can travel for hours in the car, ride all the looping, twisting, crazy rides at the amusement parks and not get sick! It's wonderful., Review_6: I stopped riding on roller coasters and other rides at most amusement parks until I started taking the BONINE tablets. Works well for me and I take it in the morning about an hour before going on any ride and I have been able to enjoy the rides with my kids!! No more nausea and headache!!!, Review_7: Product worked the very way it was intended. We were on a cruise that had high seas and because we were unable to use the patches that go behind the ear, we used this as an alternative. It worked great, no problems., Review_8: Husband and I went on week long live-aboard scuba trip. I could not have had a good time without these. THANK GOD.. it was a wonderful trip, and I did not get sea-sick at all, in a full week never leaving the small yacht we dove from. Recommend!",

It can be used for car rides, amusement parks and even multi-day cruises, all without the side effects seen with Dramamine.

The sound is robust, and the ability to dial in the mixture of rain and water effects is outstanding.Now... when will they release an App so I can use it on my phone at the office..., Review_3: We've used Marpac machines before and they were excellent; but this Travel machine didn't make the grade. Sound not loud enough for us and the construction didn't seem any better than the $20 ones we've used. This was $50 +. We returned it to Amazon., Review_4: This product does not drown out sound but is a sleep conditioner. It was purchased for my grandaughter who is going on a mission trip to Africa (it takes batteries) and to college in NC. It is a perfect traveling size., Review_5: This machine is small enough to travel well. It only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. It shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. It is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made., Review_6: We have a full-size analog model of the Marpac Sleep Mate sound conditioner, and have used it for years at home, but it's too bulky to pack. This model is compact, and sounds pretty much like the original. There is no repeating 'loop' of sound to drive you crazy., Review_7: We've had this for about two months and use it in our baby's nursery. I like it so far. The sound fills the room well. There aren't a bunch of options in sound, but that doesn't matter at all to me. The unit is small and does the job well. I'd recommend it., Review_8: My husband and I use a white noise machine in our condo, and love it. When we traveled, we never felt we slept as well without that background noise.

It only has one sound effect available, rain water, which can be adjusted to go up or down in volume. Overall, it's a good product for creating quieter sounds. However, it's lack of options and low sound intensity makes it a bit overpriced.",
                "This Marpac sound machine is compact and sized for travel. It is rather limited in how the sound can be adjusted, but overall the sound itself fills the room and generally drowns out background noise. The build quality is lower than expected for a unit of this price, so waiting for a sale is recommended."

I went on to Amazon and found this product and I have received them and am very happy with my purchase., Review_2: My husband and I use this all the time to cook whole chickens now. We don't bother putting a beer can in it. I've used it several times on the grill as well as in the oven. The chicken comes out perfectly cooked and the skin nice and crispy every time!, Review_3: I like the pan under the chicken to catch the drippings, but it is awful tall. even using the bottom rack of my oven the chicken almost touches the broiler. no way it would fit in our bbq. it really makes great tasting chicken!!, Review_4: VERY EASY TO USE AND LOVED THE WAY THE CHICKEN COOKED. JUST ANOTHER GREAT WAY OF COOKING ON YOUR GRILL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO TURN IT AROUND. YOU PUT IT ON YOUR GRILL AND GO DO YOUR SIDE DISHES WHILE YOUR CHICKEN IS DONE., Review_5: Works well, a little small thou. I usually get the biggest roaster chicken I can find (usually 6-7lbs) but this seems a little small for that size chicken (5 - 6lbs would fit better). However, love the drip pan feature, it collects all the juices so you can baste! For the price, I would Definately recomend it!, Review_6: Five stars for the collapsible design. It holds a normal size beer can but not a bottle. I only use it as a stand (humidity is irrelevant for a Char-broil infrared cooker), and it is very solid. Goes right on the rack or grill without any fear of tipping, and holds a large chicken., Review_7: This worked okay, but it didn't make much change for our grilling. I thought my husband would love it, but he was pretty apathetic... and we've only used it once - as it's a bit cumbersome. So, I guess it's okay but not 'necessary.', Review_8: This is a perfect substitute for doing rotisserie chicken in the winter when the Barbie won't heat up to temp. I use two of them at the same time to put two chickens in the oven at 475 degrees coated with Sams Rotisserie Rub and it turns out perfect every time... no beer can needed- the chickens stay moist on there own.",

It prevents wet feet from going in the house to get ice. It fits nicely on their deck and they seem to be enjoying it., Review_3: I thought this was exactly like my current ice maker but when it got here it wasn't. Once seeing it I wondered what size it was going to make but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the large cubes. It ended up being all it was advertised to be and I love it. I would recommend it to all., Review_4: This thing works like a charm. We use it in our bar at home and in our RV when traveling. You just have to remember to empty it when not in use and keep it clean. It does the job for parties! Very fast and efficient., Review_5: absolutely love it!!! this is the 2nd one we have. The 1st one lasted 8 years!!! I love having ice made all the time. I have it made by the refrigerator also but I love this machine better., Review_6: It worked as advertised although I didn't check to see if it make the actual 27 pounds per day. I bought it for the camper and seemed to satisfy the demand for ice. It sure beats paying $3 / bag at the camp store. It won't take long to pay for it., Review_7: So far I love this device. It cranks out ice in minutes. Perfect to have for entertaining, We actually bought this as a back up for our unreliable built in ice maker in our fridge. This has saved the day., Review_8: We have had this machine for 2 years. It sits outside on our patio in Arizona. It hits 115 degrees in the summer.

I do not like to put oil in the dough; however, it appears to me that without oil it is impossible to make tortilla or chapatti. It is useless for me., Review_3: I love this tortilla maker. I hate to buy them from the store and they sit in my fridge. This way I make them on the night we eat them. Yes you should grill them after to get the toasted look., Review_4: Great machine!!! I use it 3-4 times a week and perfect tortillas every time. I also make pizza crusts, pancakes and crepes. You have to get the recipe and technique right for tortillas but once you do it is easy. Love having a freezer full of bean burritos for a quick lunch., Review_5: For this price, plus the pennys you'll spend on a 3-4 ingredient mix, this appliance pays for itself in about 2 months at our house. Tortillas taste so fresh, no yucky preservatives, and you'll save TONS not buying anymore bleached white over-priced tortillas at the grocery store., Review_6: I noticed that several reviews indicated that users were using this machine to both press and cook their tortillas. This machine works in the same way as the 3000 dollar tortilla press except no automatic operation, that said a tortilla press needs to be hot to keep the tortilla from shrinking, however the tortilla needs to be finished cooking on a griddle for best results., Review_7: Fun and easy to use! Took me one batch to get my technique worked out, but it was very simple, easy to follow directions. Easy clean up too! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric tortilla maker!, Review_8: I bought this for my boyfriend for making Roti but it flattens too much and so you don't get the air pockets and flakiness that you want in roti.

I wanted to hang hot mits on my fridge, but it took some finagling to get it to stay and I could only put one mit per hook., Review_3: I purchased these hooks specifically for the purpose of hanging potholders on the magnetic fridge. They work but you have to gently hang them to prevent the hooks from sliding down. They may, however, work better on other magnetized surfaces. They are tiny and cute but I would not recommend using them as refrigerator magnets., Review_4: I purchased the set some years ago and loved how strong the magnets used on the hooks were. I ordered more last week and discovered that the magnets are now 1 / 4 the size on the previous version. The magnets are not at all as strong, and I am very disappointed., Review_5: The actual magnets are + / - 1 / 4 'in diameter, not nearly large enough to hang most things.

My frame is an 8x11 docuement with a simple frame, but it takes three magnets together to hold it up without sliding downwards., Review_8: These are tiny, and couldn't hold anything more than keys.

Everyone in my family now has one because they are so great. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I love using it to make rice - no more cleaning up boiled-over rice from the stove! It also makes corn on the cob and boiled eggs hassle free., Review_4: THIS IS MY SECOND ONE OF THESE STEAMERS. I USED THE FIRST ONE ALMOST DAILY FOR OVER 5 YEARS. I LOVE THE VERSITILITY OF THIS ITEM. MAKES EXCELLENT STEAMED SHRIMP, THE RICE IS PERFECT EVERY TIME, VEGETABLES TASTE GREAT. JUST A USEFUL ITEM TO HAVE IN THE KITCHEN., Review_5: I love this steamer. I use it to steam all kinds of vegetables and new potatoes. I really like the larger basket and the screen where you can put herbs or spices to flavor what you are cooking. I highly recommend it., Review_6: Sometimes I use the steamer for just one vegetable, or for rice, but it's really nice to have the separate basket when I want to steam two separate vegetables at the same time. I've been very pleased with the steamer and have used it several times already. The instruction book in helpful too. Thank you., Review_7: boiling broccoli always adds a ton of water and makes it super soggy, but this is the best way to cook broccoli (and other things of course...) I would definately recommend this product. The only downfall is that it's pretty big and we have NO couter space, so it makes it difficult to store it and make room for it., Review_8: This is our second B / D steamer.

Fit about as expected but the mesh is a little tighter than I'd like. (6 '205lb, wear a size 34 waist and ordered the size large which is quoted to fit a 34.) If you're on the fence, might want to go a size larger., Review_5: My wife said I had to buy a proper pair of swim trunks for an upcoming cruise.

Hopefully they can be stretched or fixed, but I'm not sure., Review_7: This is a cheap product and it shows in the material and craftsmanship.

I love the look, the feel, the factthat I can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, I received compliments on it., Review_4: I spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. It kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. I have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all., Review_5: I wear a hat anytime I am outside for any length of time. This hat is cute and provides great sun protection. I have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to Butterfly World with my granddaughter., Review_6: Good quality hat, I love that I can be protected from the sun, and look good too! I'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when I accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. I have already ordered another hat for my daughter., Review_7: I bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. They are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. Love the UPF protection. The only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. I think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase., Review_8: It looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. I wear it while gardening or for walks. I got it in the Moss Green and the color is as shown online. I'm glad I bought it.",

It protects well from the sun, keeps the head cool, and is suitable for both boat trips and more dressy occasions. Sizing is 'one size fits all' which seems to be good on even large heads. The customer service was great, ensuring the product arrived on time before travelling.",
                "This is a fashionable, functional sun hat. It is great for use on the beach and other outdoor occasions. It doesn't do as well on a boat where the wind is stronger. This hat is fantastic for sun protection. While it says one size fits all, it's more accurate to say that one size fits most.",

I'm not using banana jacks., Review_2: Cant give it 5 stars because the mounting screws that come with it are poor quality and will strip easily. Do yourself a favor, head to the hardware store and get the # 6 - 32 1 'combination machine screws and throw out the ones that come with this product. The white trim screws are OK, but not great., Review_3: cost much more from local retailers plus is a better product. some of the newer designs suck. plastic inserts don't try it if it says easier dont't buy it. this product works on old school. some times that's the best way. take a little longer to instal but no going back for loss wires, Review_4: This is OK product. looks good and easy to install.Cons: Cover is not a standard size and you probably wont be able to replace it. In addition it does not flush everything completely (not deep enough) and there is a small gap left between the wall and the plate., Review_5: All the screw heads were painted shut. I had to dig them all out before I could screw them in. The rest of the plate is ok but I didn't enjoy spending a bunch of time digging the slots out of the screws. I'd recommend going with something else., Review_6: Bought five for my 5.1. Installed into the boxes in the wall well. 4 stars for having a slight gap between the wall and the plate after install. I only notice it at slight angels. Jacks are made well wires attached well., Review_7: Easy installation and looking nice. Much cheaper than brand product at local store. However, it doesn't look as nice as the brand ones either. I suspect the connectors are made of poorly gold-plated bruss or even other metal. But for my purpose and for the price, it is OK., Review_8: Came individually packaged, with mounting screws. The backing plate is plastic, but sturdy enough.

You can use this as a weapon too. lol, Review_3: Bought this as part of the stabilizer rig then realized that this was easier to use alone than the rig itself. I am going to use it with a camera with an active stabilizer. Videos looked good. Will update after I use it this weekend. It looks good and is built solid., Review_4: I use this with a dual-camera mount and I like this because of the heft / weight and it stays pretty secure whether I use it with the mount or on my flip video camera or snapshot. I'd recommend this handle highly., Review_5: I was planning to use this with my D7000 + Battery Grip + 80-200 f / 2.8 lens, but when I received it, I changed my mind.It just does not look like it can handle that load. I put it on my Panasonic GF2, and it performs very nicely.Would highly recommend it for lighter cameras., Review_6: The unit is quite sturdy. I bought it to replace the pistol grip unit also featured because the pistol grip locking mechanism did seem to want to lock tight. This unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. A great purchase for the money., Review_7: This is the 2nd stabilizer that I've purchased... one for my Sony a99 and one for my Sony a33. I can't speak highly enough about this handy little item!

These rocks last a long, long time..., Review_2: This does indeed work and if you are not a heavy perspirer it will be effective for several days. Don't know for sure how long it will last as I've not had mine that long, but for sure it's cheaper than the stuff we've been using for years., Review_3: This stuff WORKS. It is slippery and difficult to hold on to when it is wet, so I wasn't surprised when I dropped it on the floor and broke it into four jagged pieces. I'll buy the stick next time., Review_4: I was very skeptical about the effectiveness of crystal deodorants. I am very pleased with the results! This works better than any deodorant I have ever used. I will never go back to traditional deodorants. This was money well spent., Review_5: I was somewhat skeptical at first in hearing about this product, but now I'm a believer. I purchased a crystal a year ago and it is still working. A little water activates the rock and then you apply it like a regular stick deodorant. I can't believe it works so well and lasts so long., Review_6: The product is fantastic, I would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers with excessive persperation issues or B.O. It will eliminate both after a few days use. No kidding.

I use it and it doesn't make me smell like cologne or perfume but it keeps me smelling good (like me!) all day. It does not irritate my skin and it does the job.

The problem is when I run more then 1 hour because I don't see the seconds as it has only 4 digits on the display., Review_3: Extremely easy to use, only one button. Seems to be fairly accurate. Has a backlight and can beep to warn you if you fall out of a target heart range that is completely programmable. However, the battery is not replaceable and the screen scratches easily., Review_4: I was disapointed to find the booklet with it didn't help with any instructions on use. But after checking the manual on the internet I was able to set it up and use it. It is much easier than others I have purchased. This is what I was looking for. Ease of use., Review_5: This is a good monitor if you have no need for the fancy training models. Beginner or non-competitive runners should stick to basic types like this. The Polar monitors I have had like this are well-made and easy to use and this is no exception. I am coming off a long layoff and plan to use this to work back into shape without risking overtraining., Review_6: If you're looking for just a heart rate monitor (it is waterproof and good for swimming) then this is for you. There aren't any bells and whistles at all. Straight forward, heart rate, time of exercise and that's it. The log only stores your last workouts data, you need to record it before you start another session., Review_7: This was very well-rated on consumer reports. I really like that you can plug in your target heart rate, and it has an audible alert to let you know when you're there. The display is easy to read and it's light-weight., Review_8: I ordered and Polar FT2 and it was confirmed after the order was processed. When I got the email for confirmation, it said FT1.

Small enough to place in any container I chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. Color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. Recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable weaponry or jewelry., Review_6: This dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, I even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. I keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack., Review_7: My husband is a Farrier and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. He has been using Silica Gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. He likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it., Review_8: Our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. We have placed the dry-pack silican gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. The slender dimension allowed us to do that. So far, we've had fewer jams. I've also used a larger replenishable desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper.",
            "output": [
                "This is a small can of dry-pack silica gel that can be used to reduce moisture in sensitive areas. It needs to be put in the oven for a couple of hours to dry out once the indicator bar turns green. In some cases it only reduces the humidity by 1 or 2 percent.",
                "Dry packs are great for areas where an electronic dehumidifier isn't practical. The green indicator shows when they need to be recharged, which can easily be done in the oven. They work well and come in small sizes great for use in safes and containers. They don't work as well in extreme temperatures.",
                "This dry pack is helpful for protecting items and making sure they stay dry. It's small enough to fit in pretty much any desired container, it has a convenient moisture indicator and it's easy to recharge it just by \"baking\" it in the oven. The performance isn't that great however and it needs to be recharged frequently."

Horrible - chicken greasy and cold. For what you pay it is a rip off!

Boy were we wrong. The food was terrible. My green beans were sour rotten and my sons strips tasted like they had a chemical in them. Not good. Very disappointing, Review_6: Stop. Just go to Frys and purchase their chicken. You are making a mistake eating here. This location is super slow. Never trust a restaurant that cannot turn over food via consumption quickly. Last amount of advice... go elsewhere., Review_7: Over priced chicken that is just ok I remember when the cornel owned KFC back in the late 50s and 60s it was so much better than now. The chicken pieces look like they came from a pigeon they were so small! Go to Albertsons about a mile away 8 large pieces $6.99, Review_8: Stop by for a chicken little. Boy was it little.

I didn't particularly love how many veggies were thrown in with their Beijing beef (it was almost hard to find the bits of beef in the mixture), but the beef itself was very flavorful and I LOVED their potstickers!, Review_3: I went to this place when it was still Feedbag and then turned into Wok In. I'm generous with the ratings, because the price is very good, the staff is friendly and attentive, and they have the best Vietnamese fresh spring roll. Just love it!! That, and also spicy long beans with shrimp (and / or tofu)., Review_4: We were Antique shopping and Yelp'd this location, so we decided to try it out. We will definitely be back! The prices were very inexpensive and the meals were delicious. We had Spring Rolls, Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken and the Pho. Everything was delicious!, Review_5: For $5 an entree this place can't be beat. Good food, friendly and fast service. I had the spicy Thai noodles and they're just as good as anything you'd pay for at another competing restaurant. Great place for a cheap, friendly, low pressure meal of good quality, Review_6: We decided to give this place a try based on prior reviews. The first thing we noticed upon arrival in the parking lot was a horrible smell of rotten food coming from the dumpster area. Prices are low and the staff is pleasant. The menu is limited. Crab angels were well flavored but cold. Orange chicken was overpoweringly citrusy. Vegetable lomein was unremarkable., Review_7: My husband and I love this place! We especially love to come when we are super hungry because there's never a wait! The service is great and the food comes out very fast. We always get the pho and love it!, Review_8: Talk about a restaurant that has quality fresh food at a fantastic price! I have been here twice and would highly recommend it!

Been dozens of times, always happy. Everything you'd hope for a bowling alley. Clean, nice staff, open 24 hours, good prices, snack bar, nice lounge with drinks, several bathrooms that are usually clean, lockers to use. Good times. I'll be back., Review_3: Lots of lanes. Clean. Easy to access bar, and tables and slots downstairs in case you're still fighting the urge to gamble a little. This place rocks! And it's a great step away from the regular lounges and nightclubs. $1 games on week nights from midnight-6am. With $3 shoe rentals. Including Sundays., Review_4: We came origianally for the buffet and realized that the casino had a bowling alley. We decided to take our 3 kids upstairs and do some bowling. It was $26 for 4 of us for one game (residents get a little discount when you show ID). It was pretty clean and we really liked it. Will be visiting again for some more fun, Review_5: This is probably one of the biggest bowling alleys that I've ever bowled at and I absolutely love that it's 24 hours! The service is very fast and there's hardly ever a wait. Thumbs up to the alley, the food and the workers as well!, Review_6: For a bowling alley it's pretty much perfect. After midnight it's only $1 a game, although shoes were fairly expensive at around $5 (can't remember exactly). A decent amount of drink specials along with no real complaints make this place probably the best bowling alley I've been to in Vegas., Review_7: A clean bowling alley with lots of lanes. Stay in the hotel and receive a 2 for 1 game coupon. It's a nice option to have when you've lost all your money downstairs or need a break from all the winning you're doing. There's also a small arcade attached and a snack bar for your noshing pleasure., Review_8: $1 bowling at midnight can't go wrong also a lot of lanes.

This isn't the first time my coffee is cold., Review_3: This location has pretty much gone down hill through the years in terms of service.

They always have our mobile orders ready when we walk in. Never had an issue here. Will continue to come back!, Review_5: Great place to stop by first thing in the morning.

Definitely one of my favorite spots., Review_6: Terrible service! I came in to get iced coffee.. Sat outside and came back for my refill and they said 'no.. Can't do it if you leave the store!' Wow... I love Starbucks and never had an issue like this before. Not ever coming back to this location ever!!!!, Review_7: Worst cappuccino ever. Burnt flavor and they made it twice. Way to throw $4 down the toilet. If they can't train people to do it right then don't waste your time. McDonald's coffee is better then this., Review_8: Excellent coffee and seating areas.

I usually get mine 'southern style'. It's a small place, so there's usually a wait. But, I don't mind waiting because the food is soo good! They have a nice bar selection as well. It's also in a cool, eclectic area in Charlotte., Review_4: First of all, burgers have buns, not toasted white bread. 2 out of 4 orders were wrong toppings. No refills on drinks, never once asked how the food was, and it took 45 minutes to get us 4 orders. What the hell has this place become?, Review_5: The food is really really good and is not very expensive. I love hush puppies and they were probably the best I have ever had. The burgers and sandwiches are all really good and the service is fantastic.

I got the good grains bagel w / honey almond cream cheese (yummy) while others in my group got: the pizza bagel, thin bagel sandwiches, jalapeno w / plain cream cheese, spinach florentine, and some holiday one that was super sweet.Price wasn't anything too expensive., Review_4: Surprisingly good breakfast thin asparagus mushroom and egg white. Wraps not so much. Asiago toasted with veggie always decent. However please get a better system in place because I've never been able to get out of there in less than 15 min for a bagel!, Review_5: The best Einstein location in Summerlin. Always in and out with ease and professionalism from the staff. I usually go on Mondays as they have a dozen bagels for $7! I have never ordered a specialty bagel sandwich but I would recommended for any bagel lover who wants a bulk deal., Review_6: I grab a cup from these guys every morning at this location. Great, friendly serviceThey have the best coffee, fresh, strong never burned. Jeanie is the one you want to help you when your there. She makes you feel at home., Review_7: This place is neat and clean and they have really good bagels. I also appreciate that they have a soda machine, given that I don't drink coffee. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I think it's extra nice that they will bring food to your table, even if it is merely a toasted bagel with cream cheese., Review_8: Waited like 20 minutes for a dozen bagels. Finally got home and the box with the bagels opened up from the bottom and all the bagels fell onto the driveway. Brought them back and was reluctantly given a refund and the doofus manager still tried to charge me for the cream cheese even though I had know bagels. Definitely won't be going back!",

                "This place specializes in its bagels, the asiago cheese bagel being one of their top requests.  They are a good place to get bagels in bulk on the go. They also offer sandwiches, wraps, and coffee, but those aren't what they're primarily known for. Overall this is a solid place to grab a quick breakfast in the morning, or food on the go.",

Wait staff is very professional and treat you like family. Owner is local and is very hands on; which shows in the food. Great place for lunch too!, Review_2: Very busy on weekends, yet there is never too long of a wait. Service is great and the portions are very generous, especially the pancakes! (My favorite). The new interior is very nice and adds great atmosphere!, Review_3: What a great place! Food is amazing and it's not just your ordinary breakfast or lunch spot. The food is unique and delicious. One of my favorite is the red eye hash! Fresh orange juice or a bloody mary, either way both delicious. The service is always great and the atmosphere is good., Review_4: One of our favorite breakfast spots. There's often a wait on the weekends but we've never waited more than 10 minutes. The host and wait staff and always friendly and accommodating and the food is consistently wonderful. I recommend the eggs Benedict with crabmeat or the red eye hash!, Review_5: Great restaurant. More thank likely you'll find a wait, but it's worth it. Breakfast is amazing no matter what you get. If you get a lunch try the fries, double fried, dipped in white French dressing. Or order it as a side. You'll thank me later., Review_6: Fantastic Omlets wonderful friendly service. Killer spicy Brown potatoes and the special crooked river jams. One of my top breakfast stops. Relaxing with a cup of coffee and surfing the web. great way to start the day. And they have great sandwiches too for lunch., Review_7: A very good breakfast spot that has it's own take on popular dishes. The potatoes are especially tasty, though everyone at our table enjoyed their meals which ranged from pancakes, eggs and french toast. I also like the Akron themed pictures on the wall., Review_8: Great breakfast!!! Come early because lines start early. Bloody Mary's and mimosas. Fast and affordable. Great experience.

But the Tuna Stack and Calamari are above average. It's the corporate industry types' flavour du jour and how can you blame them. The food is decent, the service is never sub-par, and the ambience is quite attractive., Review_3: There is only one vegan option on the menu (unmarked), but it was pretty good.

I don't mind waiting for the lounge when it's busy but don't be rude about it and when I ask if I can order a drink while I wait.. they walk away and ignore us. I enjoy going to the Barlow location. Not Stephen Ave., Review_6: Wonderful restaurant with great atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu items. I had the salmon and my husband had a steak. Both entrees were prepared to perfection. We will definitely return next time we are in Calgary., Review_7: My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour. Although the food wasn't all that amazing, the patio is gold! The cocktails + this patio = love. It's such a wonderful spot to just people watch and hangout especially at lunch on a workday or during happy hour as you can see the people hustling and bustling around town., Review_8: Our waitress was extremely kind.

Food is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. Best cinnamon roles around. Period. I refuse to eat anyone else's cinnamon roles.

You won't be disappointed., Review_3: My daughter and I are in Scottsdale for a meeting when we decided to try Sassy's. It was fantastic! The portions are really big.

We decided to try the cupcakes and they are just as amazing!, Review_4: Wanted to grab some cupcakes for a family members birthday and noticed that Sassy's had a little more variety than other places around. They did not disappoint. Stopped in for the cupcakes, stayed for bacon, eggs and toast (with purchased cupcakes awaiting me in the cooler) They were a big hit!, Review_5: Just started eating here a few weeks ago and it's amazing. I work close by and so I have had lunch there 4 times and each time the food is delicious. Order on the phone a head of time make it even easier to pick up and eat lunch on my break. My favorite sandwich is the Sassy Club!, Review_6: Why have I not heard of this place before? I had breakfast. It was filling and yummy the tea was good. I souls try the coffee next time. Oh yes.

Waitress has to many tables and hasn't been back by to check on us., Review_3: OMG.... new management!

Katharine was an awesome waitress- friendly informative. For all you folks that stopped coming cause of bad service (like us) - give it another shot!, Review_6: I ordered the arroz con pollo and I'm pretty sure it wasn't just chicken but pork mixed in as well.

Easier to shop on Amazon. Not worth the prices. The amount we have to spend here for one week is the same amount we would spend at other stores for 2 weeks. I've come back multiple times to try and give them more chances, but today was the worst., Review_3: The friendliest staff of any Sprouts stores I've been to. Special mention for Diana at checkout and one other gentleman (can't recall his name) that typically bags. The team at this location legitimately makes me look forward to shopping there. They make a relatively mundane task, brighter and more enjoyable., Review_4: I am convinced that all the people that work here are aliens! Not one person shoes any type of warm response even when my 2 year old happily sais Hi! Not even a smile cracked. Really? Never again will I shop there!, Review_5: I come here primarily for the produce. It's much much cheaper than Whole Foods, Basha's, Frys, etc. It's pretty groovy in here and they offer a lot of organic / gluten free / vegetarian stuff. Yeah, that's not me. However the produce is fresh, cheap and plentiful., Review_6: This is the best Sprouts store of the many Ive shopped at. They have a salad bar. Olive bar. Fresh pressed juices.

Authentic food but service was not too friendly however efficient. Would recommend for those cold winter nights to warm up. Worth a try on lazy evenings when the group becomes indecisive of food choices..., Review_3: Went there as a friend recommended the place. We ordered their famous Peking duck as my husband was craving for it. Our order came with a soup and a side dish. It was huge for two. We were satisfied and would definitely go back to the place., Review_4: This is the spot to get your Sichuan spicy food fix. The flavours are bold and authentic. You can order using an iPad. The only downside is that it is hard to wave down a server since they tend to be very busy. Although I like to dine in, I commonly get take out because the wait is less., Review_5: Worst service ever. Yes their food is good, but you will have to wait so long just to be seated when there are lots of tables available. The waiters there are rude and inattentive. Don't recommend coming here unless you're willing to wait and be served poorly., Review_6: This used to be a great place but my experiences have been unsatisfactory the last few times I came here. The servers hand you a sheet of paper write down your orders - which is fine, except they pretty much ignore you the entire time you're there. The food is mediocre and so unbelievably greasy you might as well have swallowed a bucket of oil., Review_7: Long waits for a table during peak times but food is amazing.

We also had bowls of Dan Dan noodles, which were huge and very flavorful!, Review_8: Food and customer service both were worst!! Waste of money!!!

They are very friendly and knowledgeable here. My dog is very hyper and loving they were very loving to him and helped me feel as ease. I will continue to go here for all my dogs needs., Review_4: Great hours (7 am- 11pm everyday!) and great personnel. They also have boarding and grooming in office. I've been taking both my dogs here since 2010 and don't have a single complaint. I recently moved to N Scottsdale from old town and still go to this vet because they are so reliable., Review_5: won't be back, euthanasia was pretty traumatic for me, never saw it done that way & with such lack of empathy for the owner. Had to put my cat down because of the sky hi bill & that put me in shock., Review_6: I am new to the area, and this clinic is near my house. The staff here is amazing. Wonderful customer service and bed side manner from the front desk to the techs to the Doctors. As fellow pet owners, you know our pets are like our children, and they made them and me feel so comfortable. Will definitely be returning here!, Review_7: Had to come back here yesterday because our dog hurt himself over the weekend. We had the same vet and while we had to wait about 3 hrs (walk in only, no appointments) she was very kind and gentle with our dog. Very happy with the service!, Review_8: Had a great experience here last night with our sick cat. Staff was wonderful, very friendly and really took care of us and our boy. So thankful that this place is here and open 24 hours. I will definitely recommend them to everyone I know.",

You'll love the music if you don't like Top 20 garbage. And the ambiance is great., Review_4: Cool little place. I would imagine a lot of regulars go here but a worthy coffee shop either way. The Americano was very good and they had an unreal chocolate muffin with cream cheese on top more or less. Awesome. The service was friendly. Cool decor as well.

Very nice barista, friendly and talkative without being intrusive. It was fun being almost int the barber shop and watching men get their haircut. Fun atmosphere all around., Review_7: I love coming to my neighborhood coffee shop. Open mic nights, rotating drinks, burritos, good music, helpful staff, cool artwork, and a library make this place the amazing place that it is. The staff is really helpful and quick as well. Big ups to them!, Review_8: I love this cafe, I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. The atmosphere is everything a cafe should be and the cappuccino was the closes to Italy I've come to in along time.

Fair price point and great customer service--these guys know their meat., Review_4: I feel like I am going back in time when I walk into Sanagan's. The strangely familiar smell, the sawdust on the floor and actual animals in the display cases are rarely seen anymore in today's plastic wrapped meat-counters. I love the attention I get when I visit them, and have ben happy with the product so far., Review_5: Sanagans is a staple in Kensington and rightfully so! Their selections are great and reasonably priced. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and there are always a few people working so I never have to wait in line. I love stopping in here to peruse and always leave with something great., Review_6: The best butcher's place I've ever stepped into. This place has everything you need. Fresh, delicious, mostly organic! They also have a food bar that serves chicken, fries, and the likes. They have a few tables for you to sit and enjoy. Bit pricey but come here for meat to make a nice home cooked meal., Review_7: Sanagan's offers quality products and super informed service. No idea how to prep something? Just ask, and they'll tell you everything you need to know. They also offer amazing prepared foods, spices / seasonings / brines etc, and an awesome lunch selection (get the Sunday Roast - so good), Review_8: I purchased lamb sausages and Piri Piri chicken drumsticks.The sausages were incredibly fatty.

The waitresses are very stand offish and have poor customer service. They handed me my food with no silverware or napkins. Never checked on me to see if things were fixed. Just horrible would not ever come back, Review_4: Have been there for lunch 3 times. I'm not big on sushi, but the curry Chicken, mongolian beef and shrimp were all good.

Nonetheless, everything you would expect for lunch, Review_5: The service may not be super attentive, but the prices are terrific, the happy hour is awesome, & the staff is friendly, if a bit lackadaisical. Definitely never a bad experience, & the beer choices are very fine!, Review_6: This is my go to for Asian cuisine in Ahwatukee. The service is very quick and friendly and the food is delicious. The beer special is buy 1 and get the second for a $1. My favorite is the Mongolian beef great taste with a little heat. I highly recommend Pacific Gardens., Review_7: We were going to give it a try but I called to see if they have gluten free options and they said not we don't: (this is why they get one star / They could have said we have salads or learn to evolve & have a few options. Off to Picasso's or Pomegranate cafe where we can find healthy food., Review_8: Amazing sushi that is affordable and great service, too! Friendly staff and happy hour specials last all day!!!

I thought when you ask for hold on delivery that's also a hold on making the sandwich. Nothing but the onions and crispy chips saved this sandwich., Review_3: Too bad-they had excellent service etc. corporate decided they will no longer deliver beyond El Mirage and Bell Road. They have lost $30.00 per week to other companies (Literally 2 steps beyond imaginary boundaries). When they go out of business, due to competition, perhaps they will recognize you should convenience the customers. Good riddance., Review_4: I get hooked on the turkey tom more and more each time I have one!

Good prices:), Review_5: Pretty horrible place subway, firehouse, blimpys, mr goodscents, cousins, Jersey mikes, safeway sub, pretty much any other sub place is 100000 times better, the staff was horrible the food tasted like it was left over from last week and this sub franchise has to be the worst in the valley., Review_6: Best sandwiches I've had in a long time! And they'll deliver--if you fall in their small delivery zone-- 1 sandwich to you. This comes in handy for me while I'm at work and hungry! I love the bread & their mayo. YUM! I usually order the beach club. No complaints from me!, Review_7: The food I ordered was ok but the customer service was horrible. The young man taking my order was rude and had no personality. He didn't say hi or even greet me. The lady making my sandwich said hi and was more friendly. The food was not the best but what do you expect from a fast food sandwich shop!, Review_8: WOW!!!

It was okay. Probably find a different place to eat next time., Review_3: Ordered tom kha today and opt for delivery. The soup came sooner than they had quoted which was nice, and the soup itself was delicious and the portion is enough to last a few days! The man who delivered it was also very kind.

The dishes are not your typical run-of-the-mill recipes. The sauce on the Tikka Masala, for instance, has a smokey flavor I love. The wine selection is nice too. Who knew wine paired well with Indian food?, Review_2: I love the creamy curries that Himalayan has, and although it may be expensive (relatively), I personally love coming here whenever I'm looking for lavish Indian meals. I always get the classic butter chicken, naan, and Shahi paneer. I'm a huge fan!, Review_3: Really good curry chicken. I enjoyed my meal, tasted pretty authentic being that my family is from the Caribbean and eats curry all the time. My boyfriend enjoys their butter chicken. Everything tastes good with white rice and the naan bread!, Review_4: I came here two days in a row because dang this place has some great food! Both times, I came during the lunch hour and honestly, the service was on point! Friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the rice puff salad with avocado, garlic naan and the pistachio chicken. D to the lish!, Review_5: We loved the food here. The service was very good. The Dosa is totally authentic! Thin and crispy and full of curry potatoes. We came back a second time in one week just for more Dosa! The Himalayan lamb curry was really good as well. We'll definitely be regulars., Review_6: I'm in town on business and this is across from the Hyatt. First, they have done a great job with the renovation on the property! Next, the food was delicious. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and ate every morsel. Can't wait to come back with more people, so I can enjoy the ambiance and share more options!, Review_7: My friends birthday was this evening and this was the place she chose to go! I had always seen it in passing, but had never been. Let me tell you - don't hesitate to stop! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with mild sauce and it was amazing! The restaurant was clean and inviting with great customer service! I will be back!, Review_8: Really enjoyed dinner here! Their butter chicken and Bhuna ghost were great. The starters were pretty good except the pani puri was missing the sweet chutney. The portions were a little small for the price of the food. Overall great experience though.",

                "This is truly an authentic Indian restaurant. It's very clean and offers a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. The service is on point, attentive, and friendly, but the prices are a little high for the portion size. There are a variety of curries to choose from, and the Chicken Marsala, Classic Butter Chicken, and Shahi Paneer are exceptional. The naan is great, too. Also, the establishment has a wine selection, which pairs surprisingly well with the dishes.",
                "The state of the restaurant has a fancy feel to it on the inside without the prices. Everything on the menu has an Indian twist but still very authentic and is really tasty. The curry chicken and the rice puff are the stars of the menu.  It has a very large wine bar that pairs with the dishes. The service is always on point too.",
                "This Indian restaurant is very well-regarded. The food is great; the Chicken Tikka Masala in particular is very well-liked. The atmosphere is also excellent, with friendly, efficient customer service and a newly-renovated interior. The only caveat is that the price is a little high. Overall, this restaurant is highly recommended."

The level of attention and dedication these guys have to make sure they put out the best product is what sets them apart from everyone else. I heard a new location is opening downtown soon!, Review_3: We love going to marios for a quick chicken purchase. The staff is very friendly they will add some Piri piri sauce to your chicken and cut it all up for you. They send it home with you in a nice little thermal bag to keep it warm. Just be careful because the sauce does start to leak out after some time:), Review_4: Work at the hospital and our group frequently order from this place... The chicken is always fresh.... Juicy and perfectly cooked.... We always call in before we pick up Cuz the line during lunch hour can get really long at times... The potatoes are really flavorful as well... Good choice for dine in as well..., Review_5: Very fast and friendly service. The chicken was moist and the piri piri hot sauce was delicious. Got steamed vegetables which was good. Next time i will try the potatoes and rice when i can eat carbs again. $10 for half chicken meal. I will be back often!, Review_6: The chicken is the best in Mississauga. (Short of Portugal, Toronto is where you find the best). Customer service is not their forte. I've followed Mario's BBQ for over 15 years, so I have a soft spot for them. I prefer their chicken over Brasas., Review_7: One of the most flavorful Portuguese chicken situated in the heart of Mississauga! Perfect dinner solution whenever you don't feel like cooking. What you get for the price is ridiculous! The rice, chicken and potatoes goes together so well.. Must ask for the piri piri sauce, it makes the meal that much better!, Review_8: Great food but can be a hit and miss.

I enjoyed the zucchini in the pizza but the tomatoes made the pizza a little watery, and the cheese was a little rubbery. Other than that, I enjoyed the crust not too thick and not too thin. The pepperoni pizza was better. They delivered to our hotel and had easy online ordering., Review_3: i love their pizza! I've had just a basic bacon pizza and it was so delicious. Thtey're always so friendly, and they know exactly who we are once we ask for chicken & bacon. haha Their prices are really reasonable too., Review_4: This place is great. We basically selected it randomly from Yelp and they delivered right to our hotel room. The process was nice and easy and the pizza was awesome!!!

I thought it was a problem that the only way I knew I was in a pizza joint is because there were pizza boxes on the wall. It didn't even smell like pizza. It was confusing., Review_7: Meh... the pizza dough just ok, yuck sauce, good toppings and cheeses. More onions when I order 'add onions for $1'. More toppings on the actual pizza would be good. They have that 'good ranch' though! I wouldn't Order from here again, as I think there are much better options available., Review_8: Great place to eat! Customer service was excellent. Did.

I am very impressed with their food: the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I have tried their lamb shank and beef kebab.... Amazing!, Review_2: It was a nice place in a very odd spot. Hard to find entrance and I don't think their vents work very well in kitchen since it was extremely smokey when we walked in. They don't have fountain soda only cans, so no free refills. The food was ok. Not anything I really think we would go back for though., Review_3: Great food and we had a great time here interfering a party that seemed to be going on here. The family platter we got was sooo good, would definitely return! I also really liked the sour milk yogurt drink they have here., Review_4: If you are looking for great Iranian (Persian) or Mediterranean food this is the place to go! They have the best food and the greatest customer service. If you are in Vegas stop by this place, don't miss out on it!, Review_5: I am very excited that I found this restaurant. They offer a very good lunch special menu with good prices for generous portions of delicious food. I plan on returning often. The beef koobideh kabob was succulent and the side salad was refreshingly bright., Review_6: I highly recommend American Gypsy Cafe. I stop by for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in Vegas. I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great food, great service, great all around dining experience!, Review_7: Eaten there twice so far and both time everything has been excellent. Very tasty food and the owner actually goes in the back and cooks it all up himself. Falafel appetizer and hummus are great starters and the beef koobideh kabobs are great. My friend had the chicken koobideh kabob and loved it. Lunch specials have great deals too., Review_8: I saw ants in the kitchen area on the way to bathroom. Do not eat here!!! Omg unsanitary. Be aware!! I canceled my order and left asap. You could get staph infection from ants and other bugs. Costumer beware!",

My lunch special of beef enchiladas were flavorful and came with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. The standard sides of rice and beans were moist and delicious. Chips and salsa were, like the entire meal, several notches above average., Review_2: The service was okay. The food is awful. I don't want a chicken taco that is full of lettuce. Let alone all of them are just stuffed with lettuce and hardly any meat. Not to mention food was not very hot when it got to the table. I will not eat there again., Review_3: Best fish taco I've had since leaving South Florida!! Great bartender too! Can't remember his name but he was super fun, pretty buff, and was always doing something! Lol Highly recommend going for a magi taco. That's the only thing I tried and it was so good I ordered another! Can't wait to go back., Review_4: Just left, didn't get waited on after 15 minutes of being in the bar area. Bartender / server saw me standing at end of the bar, ignored me, served 2 men that were there at least 10 minutes after we walked in., Review_5: This place was tasty even though my the meat on my taco salad was a little dry. It had a great atmosphere that would be great for families. They were super helpful with any questions I had and always kept my glass full. Overall, I had a great time., Review_6: Went in for lunch today the place was actually pretty empty so I was surprised at how long it took the food was good not amazing but good would go back. For some reason I just think the one on Northern was always better when I was growing up, Review_7: I am an Arizona native I used to love this place. WHAT HAPPENED!!! This place is gross. I ordered the burrito enchilada style Gross! The chips were cold I hate that. The service was fine but the food was horrible. Never going back!!!!!!!, Review_8: I've been twice now. .once at lunch and once at happy hour... service is terrible. At 1130 we waited for 10 min before being acknowledged and brought to a take.

It was cold and prosciutto had an unexpected sweet taste. The waitress was nice and didn't charge us for the uneaten appetizer. Nice drink menu with reasonably priced wine., Review_2: What can I say, Eno Vino is one of my top 5 in Madtown. The small plates are better than full meals at some places, and of course the wine selection is outstanding. But probably the most significant draw that really puts the icing on the cake is the location and VIEW. Great photo ops and ambience for a nice Barolo and bruschetta plate., Review_3: This place is awesome. First of all great views and cocktails are pretty good. They know how to shake and stir em. We had a shit ton of stuff I was there for a work function with work so it all kind of blurred together but we literally had at least two of everything I was disappointed with nothing., Review_4: Wowee sooo delicious and the view is great of the Capital. Different kinds of bruschetta., shrimp ceviche, and calamari fries with a great spicy dipping tomato sauce. We wanted to try the truffle fries but couldn't fit them., Review_5: Eno Vino never fails to impress. I've been here during peak hours, and at times when I'm one of 5 people in the bar. Each and every time, I've been made to feel special! From long conversations about wine re-carbonating methods, to getting free food because of minor chef mistakes, Eno Vino has proven they are dedicated to customer service, Review_6: What fantastic views of Madison from Eno Vino downtown! This bar is an amazing addition to the downtown scene. My husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and despite it being quite busy we were able to find a spot fairly quickly. I highly recommend visiting this hip bar & bistro!, Review_7: Don't know why I didn't stop in sooner, it's bright and loud with excellent views of the Capital area. They have a solid drink menu and small plates. Of all the plates we had the Goat cheese tortellini really stood out! Parking nearby., Review_8: I live the original Eno vino way better in term of serving speed and quality of services including the way cheeseboard is not being served with wood board here in downtown location.

We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch. Friendly and attentive servers as well. The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The beer selection is decent as well. Overall, good experience and we'll go back!, Review_3: Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat., Review_4: So disappointed! This is our standard brunch spot with friends and it's always been great until this visit. Portions were very small, most of our orders were incorrect and the quality of ingredients has gone way down. This place used to be great, not sure what's happened., Review_5: This place is always delicious. The brunch is awesome and they have Mimosas with options for juice. I asked for light orange juice and they added the perfect amount. The sweet potato tots are good but the dipping sauce was even better. They always have great specials and happy hours. The burgers were perfect cooked to order and the staff was friendly, Review_6: Great menu - lots of different menu ideas for the area! Love the Thai salad and homewrecker sandwich! Ruben rolls are awesome for happy hour! Happy hour is super busy so get there earlier or be prepared to wait a hot minute!!, Review_7: Not yo 'stereotypical dive bar with a healthy craft draft list and some unexpected twists on burgers, sammies, and appetizers. The sweet potato tots will satisfy even the sweetest of tooths especially with the cinnamon + brown sugar butter dip that comes with. Surprisingly addictive. Props to the service on a very busy Pens night playoff win!, Review_8: I eat here regularly. It is family favorite. You get better service if you sit at the bar rather than at a table.

This is the second time I have been here, they did a perfect job again. They get it done fast yet with precision. Everyone is so friendly there too. Best nail salon I have ever been too. I'm glad I found it., Review_4: I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out., Review_5: My first set of acrylics ever... I decided 27 years was a lot enough time to wait, and I'm SO happy with them. I'm not a huge nail person, and was glad to stumble upon this salon. My nail tech was quiet, clean, and very detail-oriented. Very pleased with my experience here and I recommend this place., Review_6: I called to make an appointment for later today for 3 adults and 2 kids and the man who answered the phone said 'we only have 2 techs today' we can't do that. Poor customer service and I never even went in., Review_7: Golden Nails has been my nail place for almost a year so it was surprising to see new management. However B did an AMAZING job on my coffin chrome nails and Nancy was extremely helpful figuring out how I wanted my nails done too. Definitely excited to keep coming back!, Review_8: Seriously the best service I have ever gotten at a Tempe nail salon!! I walked in and they helped me right away. Nancy helped me pick the perfect color and was very honest and up front about everything! I wanted something very natural and using the dip method, I love my nails!!",

They have added breakfast and a Freestyle Coke Machine! There are so many choices and things to try. I love the drive thru and the inside is very comfortable and clean. You can tell that the place has been around awhile but the workers take pride in what they do. Delicious!

Got the original chips and an ice tea. The store was clean, nice, and has a lot of seating areas. The staff was very friendly and nice., Review_5: Nasty, rude employees. The bathrooms are horrible. They always close early: went to drive through 20; minutes before closing, and they ignored me. I called, and a girl told me they were closed. Not the first time this has happened., Review_6: Giving this a 2 star. Just left this location and we waited over 20 min for 2 kids pizza and a turkey sandwhich. The store was not busy and no one told us what was taking so long. When we got our food, there was not even a sorry about the wait. Very disappointed in this trip, Review_7: Fourty five minutes for two sandwiches come on.... Staff properly. The new girl at the registrar screwed up the order twice, then we sat 45 minutes for two sandwiches along with the rest of the place of starving people. Will never come back! They say they cater it would be scary to see how long they would take to get it to my office!, Review_8: I'm truly thankful I work down the street!

However, constant changes in managers (seven in the last three years) barrtenders, and waitresses have convinced me to take my business elsewhere.

Only issue is I went there to watch the AFC Championship game and the volume being down took away from the environment. But I never checked to see if they could raise the volume so I won't take away from them., Review_3: Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this 'our place'. Closed. Sad but true, Review_4: Been here a few times.. service is good, food is ok, but its the surroundings are interesting. Always smells funky in there.. like bratwurst and an sweatsock. Despite this i would return to watch a game or do some off track betting., Review_5: Service is 'OK'. Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way., Review_6: If I'm looking for a group of frowny faces from the staff, I know where to go. The bartender was rude and seemed to pay more attention to the people she knew and did more standing around then anything. Safe to say I won't be returning, Review_7: Yay!!!! It's good to walk into this place and see a familiar faces!! The other bar tenders suck! But Megan is the best!!!! She is friendly and knows her shit. Un like the other rude nasty bitches working here!!!, Review_8: I love this spot. Been coming in for years. They serve their beer in frozen glass and it's always cold & delicious.

I have been here more then any other restaurant in the 8 years I've been living here and it is always consistent. Great food, great service and great atmosphere!, Review_3: As a sushi connoisseur, I believe Jade serves some of the best sushi in Charlotte. It is fresh and has exceptional flavor--however, it is also a tad pricey. Even still, the cost is worth it, as their cherry blossom rolls are to die for., Review_4: It's a good thing the food is good, because the service sucks. If you go for lunch and only have an hour, ask for your check as soon as you get your food... might make it out within an hour., Review_5: BEST SUSHI IN CLT PEOPLE! Jade is located in the Ballantyne area of South Charlotte. If you are looking for sushi that is fresh with many unique options this is the spot! They have everything from Pad Thai to Vietnamese, to fresh fish! My favorite is really the sushi, such great food... a must when you are in Charlotte!, Review_6: We went here on a nice night for dinner so we were able to sit outside, which was nice.The food was excellent. We ordered three types of rolls and they were all delicious. They have a good menu of both regular rolls and specialty ones which is nice. They have a good location and I will definitely be back:), Review_7: I love going to Jade for a evening dinner. When the weather is beautiful and you can sit on there patio and enjoy the comings and goings of the people below. It's always a excellent experience!

This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation!, Review_2: Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure., Review_3: One of my favourite things about. Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality., Review_4: I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)!, Review_5: The quality of food was average. I've had better sushi at Moto sushi (at Yonge and Sheppard). The waitresses were pretentious and snoopy.When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.I would not go to this place again., Review_6: Sushi was of low-quality. The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store. Was expecting much better. Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass. Plenty of better options in the area. Will not be going back to this place., Review_7: I had the grilled vegetable teppanyaki, and I thought it was OK, nothing particularly special. The service was excellent though -- the waitresses were very stealthy (you barely noticed them clearing your table, etc), the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice. Good for groups!, Review_8: I had the ribeye steak combo medium rare. It was so soft and buttery and just so good!!

Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it., Review_3: Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line... it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street... Save your self some time and aggravation... just take your money elsewhere..., Review_4: This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours.., Review_5: Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait..., Review_6: Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies., Review_7: 0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again., Review_8: I would hope the owner reads these reviews. He / she needs to find a real manager somebody who can whip this location into shape.

What else is there to say? It's a Trader Joes. Awesome food, great employees. I don't know what I could complain about. Skip Fry's and shop here. The food is healthier and taste better., Review_7: The parking for this location can be a madhouse because it's located in a very busy strip mall and largely due to the construction surrounding it. But in TJ fashion, it won't disappoint with all the usual goodies that make you feel so adult and domesticated shopping here.

You can get nebulizer machine around $50 at amazon, bennet medical charge you almost twice more expensive price. And breathing kit price was unbelievable too. Because of deduction, I had to pay them all out of my pocket whatever they charged. I don't recommand this medical company to anyone., Review_7: Good luck getting a phone call back or someone to answer the phone without hanging up immediately. I have called over 20 times left 5 voicemails over the last 30 days, just to refill a mask perscription. This is an ongoing issue that is beyond frustrating. Not trying to destroy this businesses name just want the owners to implement some basic customer service skills., Review_8: Always receive friendly customer service whenever we call or go into the location.

There isn't anything on the menu that is bad (except the tea but you don't go there for the tea). I would drink the broth by the gallon if I could. I can't go a few days without going back., Review_5: Love this place!!! I had the coconut Thia ramen and my whole table tried to steal it from me-so good. My daughter got the curry chicken cutlet- yummy. I would ask for the curry on the side because this portion has more that enough for left overs and you don't want it to be soggy., Review_6: My husband and I are so happy that Yume has opened near our home! The 20 hour pork broth used on the ramen is the ultimate comfort food. This restaurant is fabulous. We are looking forward to trying other dishes. The restaurant and the very friendly and helpful owners exceeded our expectations., Review_7: Best ramen in NC. Took a two hour drive from Raleigh to try this place. Owner is from SF and worked at SF Japan town ramen place before. The soup base is the real stuff, not fake powders like other places. Will come back again for sure., Review_8: Awesome ramen. We tried the Shio ramen and miso ramen; both were made very well. Agedashii tofu and pork curry bowls were equally tasty. Prices are not cheap but aren't outrageous either.

Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for., Review_3: Came on a Tuesday afternoon. Plenty of seating. Wanted some good dim-sum. Our server was Tony. Very attentive. The tripe wasn't what we were used to, but otherwise it was all very delicious. It's a bit pricey plus the taxi fare since it's further up the strip., Review_4: We enjoyed Dim Sum here recently with friends who are regulars. Everything was quite good, the ambiance was a little sterile and unwelcoming, but I think that is the case at most dim sum places. I did like that they bring you the dishes as you order them, rather than wheeling a cart around. We LOVED the steamed pork buns!, Review_5: I really like the food at Pearl Ocean. The food is dim sum style but without the cart. The food was very delicious. We got to sit at a booth which I really liked because it was intimate.Customer service is really good. Try this place! Tony and Maritsa were excellent!, Review_6: The dim sum is similar to the dim sum found in the better dim sum restaurant in San Jose, Ca area. The dim sum was freshly made and service was attentive and fast. We liked it enough to return the next day. It is one of the better dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area. Also, parking is very easy and free., Review_7: This place is okay for dim sum. It was not too pricey and locals get a discount so make sure to ask for the locals discount. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I'm on the strip and in the mood for dim sum it's worth trying. Overall it was really fine., Review_8: Awesome selection of dim sum for lunch, service is fast and friendly. Seems like I'm there everyday having lunch. Dinner service is equalling great from authentic Chinese dishes to live seafood you can pick right from the wall of tanks.

No pushy pressure sales they just want you to be happy and find the car of your dreams. If you're in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I would definitely check this place out plus they do not nickel and dime you as bad as other Porsche dealerships I've been to. Mark Siffert is your go-to salesman., Review_5: The salesman Ian was too good to take my Porsche code to see exactly what I wanted. He cut me off continuously. Is it too much effort to listen to a customer that will be spending over $150,000 for a car. Shame on you Porsche, customer service needs to be better.

Three stars because the food was edible. Ordered the chicken fries, cheese quesadilla and a carnitas torta. The three of us thought the food was bland and the meats dry. It's okay, but not great., Review_3: This place is very delicious. I've had the chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, and the California burrito and they were all very delicious. The horchata and jaimaca are also very good!

Such a big disappointment. I will continue to look for a 'good spot', Review_6: Came here for the steak fries after reading the reviews. Food was served quickly and everything tasted pretty good and seemed fresh. The portion size was crazy--way too much to eat. I definitely want to come back and try some of the other menu items., Review_7: Ordered through Uber eats. Got 2 chicken enchiladas, pastor fries, plain nachos, and a large sprite. The enchiladas and fries were good. But the soda was unflavored carbonated water, and 'plain nachos' is just chips.

Portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. The quality is there though. As others were saying, the donairs are really good! Definitely order those if you haven't tried them., Review_3: Came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of Roncy. Started with the beignets and had the English breakfast for the main. The beignets were AMAZING--soooo much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. The english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing., Review_4: My boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. Drinks were good, dessert was good. Server was personable and cool. The shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. This restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. It just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit., Review_5: Halifax donair all the way. Back room for a reso is a must. Great space for a 8 - 12 person party.

If something is not up to your expectations, they will work to make it right. This is genuine Thai food, with spice levels to match. Love the curries., Review_7: Awesome little Thai place! The food is amazing, my wife and I both loved our food! Entree portions are generous, and they offer awesome lunch deals for $6.95. So happy to finally have a great Thai restaurant on our side of town!! We'll definitely be back!!, Review_8: We got the Thai Fried Rice, egg rolls and many others. Fresh veggies, perfectly cooked rice and egg rolls! Thai Tea was delicious. Good portions, not too much, friendly service: -). I look forward to going back and trying the curry.",

The food is very good, particularly the panang curry is highly recommended.   They give generous portions at very reasonable prices. Overall this place is recommended for authentic quality Thai food.",
                "This small Thai restaurant is known for its good service, courteous staff and authentic food. While the dishes are generally tasty, the meat can be dry or overcooked. They offer economic lunch deals and generous entree portions.",

Beautiful and clean building and we'll forever love Greg but we didn't love the venue. The acoustics were off, the seating was strange (hard to see and hear) and rather than fostering a welcoming visit the whole ordeal felt really rushed., Review_2: MAC is a great venue. Matthew Morrison was kinda boring though. The song choices sounded the same throughout the night. I almost wished he would stop singing and let the symphony play. The symphony was amazing. I would definitely go see them again. Great talent., Review_3: Been coming here for years. Many shows here and never a disappointment. Great seats all around. Great prices. Great restaurants near by. I recommend coming here even if it's just to walk around. They have free outdoor shows often. I love my experience here., Review_4: My favorite theater in Phoenix! Relatively new, and part of an arts complex with multiple theaters classes and loads of events throughout the year. Theater has no bad seats and the events are super fun. Come by and spend some $$in downtown Mesa. Also the Light Rail that goes here too., Review_5: Great place to see some interesting art, but only cell phones (no flash) pictures are allowed. The Phoenix Art Museum allows non-flash pictures with regular cameras and is a great place to get some interesting, unique pictures. It is sad the Mesa Arts Center is not as open to editorial photography as its larger counterpart., Review_6: I love the Mesa Arts Center. The concert halls and displays that come through are always great. Plus the facility itself is really top notch and very well updated. Hopefully downtown will continue to revive a bit and match the quality of the Arts Center as the city continues to help develop a healthy and thriving downtown., Review_7: No lie, I'd pay $20 more to see a concert here than I'd pay at 99% of the venues I've been to. Clean, booming sounds with crisp highs and lovely mids throughout the Fiona Apple show only make me wish more bands I love would come through Mesa., Review_8: Horrible seating very very disappointed at the show for The Who's line is it anyway and very very disappointed since I'll show you the attachment photo of my view of the stage and what I can see the ikeda theater has horrible balcony seating. Stay away from seats 3,4 balcony 11.",

Overall this building is recommended for a fun experience.",

Sometime it's great, but sometimes it's really hard to see and hear the performers. Overall an exciting and well-located venue right downtown, but it doesn't always offer a good audience experience.",

Staff is very polite (called me sir) and batender was very knowledgable about the wine. I would go back anytime.

She especially loved the cheese plate and french onion soup. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here, especially the warm hospitality from the owner who was there at dinner and welcomed us., Review_5: I'm not sure why I was so hard with my first review of Tartine. The food is really good and although you are right on top of your neighboring table, that doesn't make it a 3. Maybe I was being too selective that day..., Review_6: The best combination of atmosphere, food, and 'vibe' in Cleveland. Would be great if they took reservations, but this is the rare place that gets me to suspend my usual 'no reservations / no business from me' policy., Review_7: Love the atmosphere of this place. It tends to attract a slightly older crowd but that is okay by me! The Brie was very good but the French onion soup was just okay. Quite a bit if oil in it and it tasted under seasoned to me. I should have gotten the beet salad like my friend did! Excellent wine list., Review_8: Amazing. Excellent choice for lunch. Baked Brie and crab cake appetizer. Perfect. Lamb stew over phylo pastry had just the right amount of burgandy. Steak A Poivre was a small portion, amazing taste and cooked as ordered. Outstanding choice for family, friends or customers.

Family owned - super sweet, great service - pride in every dishEvery bite better than the nextBrewed THAI Iced Tea is the perfect finisherWill tell friends and FOR SURE return, Review_3: It is great but compared to other Ruth's Chris in North America, both the service and the food are not as top levels as they should be here. Thus, 3 instead off a regular 4 or 5. But the prices are as high.The place is pretty noisy as well, probably because it is in the basement with a low ceiling., Review_4: The best filet minion in Toronto. Super smooth and melts in your mouth. Came here for winterlicious, great price point to try out different things. I had the Caesar salad as an app and I wasn't impressed. I also got to try the stuffed chicken I must say it was Delish., Review_5: 4 stars for the amazingly soft and tender steak! Everything else weren't too great but the steaks at Ruth's Chris are hands down my favourite for now. Had a steak from here for the first time and now I'm hooked!, Review_6: Hey Everyone! Ruth's Chris Steak House is soooo delicious! I love it and am impressed every time. The steak comes out sizzling hot and is so moist. It's perfect! If your craving a really good steak and want to spend a little bit more then your typical restaurant, I highly recommend it!!, Review_7: Got the filet with a side of Mac and cheese. Steak was cooked very well, tried to be a little too fancy with the Mac just needed to keep it simple. All in all good would have just gone to the keg if I had a choice., Review_8: First time at this restaurant. From the greeting at the door, through the servers and other staff, service was impeccable. Had the bbq shrimp and petit filet and my husband had the lobster bisque and petit filet.

Gave random, false wait time and was still unable to accommodate a party of 2 with a table after having waited more than double the time as promised. That's 1.5 hr wait. No systematic booking system but a simply old note pad. Don't bother coming without reservation. And don't trust the hostess., Review_3: Ordered at 9: 15 and dishes started coming out in an hour, even for the most basic dishes. Drinks took about 30 minutes to come out. Ordered short ribs at 9: 15 and they came out at 11: 15. Right before the store closes. Never again and don't recommend., Review_4: Food is A-OK! Was a bit pricey, approx. $130 for 5 items and not full at all..... (could be because I eat a lot.... haha). Even thought the server explain each dish, my friend and I still don't what we were eating.... Probably won't come back again, Review_5: It's ok, nothing special. I still think Sushi Run is better. Their price is kind of high for little amounts of food. Hubby and I ordered 5 assorted sashimi and we only got about 10 pieces for $27. Spicy tuna sushi had too much rice. The only cool thing about this spot is that it's actually Japanese owned., Review_6: They have limited amount for the deluxe lunch bento, which I recommend. The portion might not look a lot, but once you start eating you will get full in the end. I also tried the katsu-don bento, which is very good. So, make sure more than 2 people go so you can try variety from the menu., Review_7: Now I don't need to wait for trips to Vancouver to get my fix. This is the best Japanese tavern in town. It's much more comfortable than Guu (chairs have backs). The Tuna Tataki is brilliant. Try the addictive Pork Ramen., Review_8: I love Kingyo, I'm always satisfied when I come here and have yet to order something I don't like.

I prefer it to Kinton's veg. bowl. I really like the atmosphere! Service was very nice and attentive, was a great meal to have with some out of town friends. Ps....... Bathrooms are really cool. Toilet seats are heated. Crazy., Review_8: It's hard to compete with 'Kinton' a few shops down, but with their prices and original / delicious broths, they are in contention. It's a nice place to go for cheap, fast, and feeling Ramen. They let you choose which oil / sauce you want on the side which is neat.",

I am also pretty sure everything taste great. Don't walk in wife my wife if you are paying. You will be broke. They have fudge galore and good selection of ice cream., Review_6: If you like ice cream, you will like Kilwins. An added bonus, if you order a 'single scoop,' they are kind enough to allow 2 half-scoops! So, if you have trouble deciding, you can split the scoop!

I have a sensitivity to preservatives in dairy. You won't find that here! This is literally the only ice cream I can eat. Kilwins.. please don't ever change!, Review_8: Terrible service today.

We were seated and given menus but after that we were completely ignored. The server never did come back to take our order and after about 15 minutes of waiting we got up and left the restaurant, unable to even order our food.Extremely poor service., Review_6: We had an amazing server. Her name is Kari. She was very pleasant and very attentive to our needs. The food was great too. I will definitely keep coming here for the food but mainly for her and the amazing service that she gives!!, Review_7: We had an early before workday breakfast here and the food was delicious.

I like the thin crust pizza, comparable to Vito's but better. Hubbys calzone didn't have ricotta, isn't that standard in a calzone? Is it strange they're only open for 5 hrs? I was wanting to pop in for lunch the other day but realized they open at 4pm., Review_3: Absolutely the best pizza I have ever eaten! They actually put sauce on the pizza.. with real tomatoes.... had thin flavorful crust... chocked full of the pepperoni, sausage, onion and mushrooms! Yum... moderately priced for all the cheese and toppings.... a must try!, Review_4: The chicken wings were disappointing. We ordered 5 wings and got 5 chicken nuggets for $6, they were not worth 1.25 a piece. We also ordered an Italian beef. Was not impressed concitering we are from Chicago it doesn't compare. Over all not good for the price., Review_5: Wow amazing deep dish pizza!!! The food truck was up in Scottsdale got the deep dish cheese pizza for $5 a slice, it's huge. I wanted to try it before driving over to the Gilbert or Chandler. Amazing taste, it's worth the drive., Review_6: Great location with a bar in house. Store is very clean and service is top notch.

Strong, tasty cocktails for $6 between 4p-9p.Another consistency after many visits is the staff almost completely ignore you. Be prepared to wait up to half an hour for a server, or stand at the bar for 5 minutes until someone notices you., Review_5: Dinner here on Saturday, pre-show.

The beef bourguignon crepe was fine, but not amazing either. My friends felt similarly about their dishes, as well. Bottom line is that it's good, but there are better places to go for the price point that would offer better flavours and dishes., Review_5: Winterlicous tonight. For $25 / person you won't go wrong.

I went in with my family and had a great exp. And have been regular every week (the lady at front desk would vouch for it:))., Review_2: Service was great, authentic food from India but a little to authentic with the no ice. I respect the cultural reasons but in AZ summer cold ice water is a necessity. Food was delicious & you can tell they are very popular within their own community with the amount of take out orders... tons!, Review_3: Worst place to order food... they say order will be ready in 20 mins and they keep you waiting for more than an hourWorst Service experience and there is no place to sit.Hope they realize how worst is their service and at least try to empathize with people who are waiting in queue, Review_4: One thing that I always missed in Phoenix (since I moved here in 2015) was a good biriyani place. I came to know about this place last year and I must say it's the best biriyani I had in Phoenix till now. My personal favorites are paradise special chicken biriyani and goat biriyani., Review_5: Prompt service and really tasty food. I've had the weekend combo special which has biryani, fried rice, a cup of dessert, 2 appatizers, 1 curry and also one naan. It was a big portion and biryani was full of flavor although not the best I've had., Review_6: Reasonable to mediocre food but extremely slow and inaccurate service. Ordered a dosa along with other non veg items. Butter chicken came with slivers of what tasted like tandoori chicken. Dosa arrived so late - the rest of the food was already consumed by the rest of the party. Sambhar arrived cold. Management needs to hire additional help, and train them better., Review_7: I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars. The people who work here actively discriminate against LGBTQ customers. When same-sex couples go into this restaurant, they will seat you, give you attitude, and then proceed to tell you that everything on the menu is 'out' .Yeah, they will never see my face or a dime of my money., Review_8: Worst Service after being in restaurant after 30 mins also no one came to take order, we had to leave and had to goto different restaurant also they had seated us in table after they asked us to change the table because more people came.",

The avocado toast is on sliced storebought bread. The multigrain pancake was nothing to remember. The house coffee is watered down. Maybe we ordered the wrong items but it really was a forgettable experience., Review_3: Great food, great atmosphere. Has a patio to enjoy the outdoors. Staff is always friendly. They offer free coffee and infused water while you wait. The menu is extensive with plenty of healthy options as well. Parking is easy. The only complaint is that the wait is sometimes really long, but thats because it's popular., Review_4: We have came twice within the last two weeks and food was good. Fresh and tasty! My kids love the chocolate chip pancakes. The potatoes are my favorite! Staff is friendly and attentive. Inside is clean and very modern. They also have outside patio seating that will be nice once the temperature cools down., Review_5: I'll be honest, I'm really sick of the faux local cafes. We won't be back. The food is overpriced for the quality, my omelet had about three sprinkles of chorizo, and the potatoes were uninteresting. Coffee is cheaper at Starbucks. Upsides- Our waitress was very good and the millionaire's bacon was tasty., Review_6: It's was pretty cold in here. The morning juiced beet juice was absolutely delicious. The menu had a variety of healthy meals. I was pretty impressed. I had lemon risotto blueberry pancakes. This was the best pancakes I've had. The flava just popped in my mouth. I will be back to try something different., Review_7: Good food & service. Usually crazy busy on the weekends!!

Will definitely come back to try more on the menu., Review_2: The atmosphere was outdated and old. The food was cold. We had the onion soup which was tasty, but our main meal was sub par. The Ruben was underwhelming and the burger was dry. The wait staff was friendly and eager to serve. Unfortunately we won't be back., Review_3: What a gem.

Great pizza and everything we had was fantastic. Great service and great food. Well done., Review_4: Decided to try Trios while in town for my daughters soccer tournament and it did not disappoint!

The Trio sampler was the perfect combo of salad, fruit and chicken salad and the key lime pie was nothing short of amazing!, Review_5: We went here for Restaurant Week and it was yuck, just yuck. The salads were good, but the decor and the entrees are straight out of the 80's and everything was either overcooked or oversalted.

I'll definitely be back., Review_2: I was excited to return here and we had such a good dinner. Watching dinner being prepared on the large grill and picking what you want makes this a fun place. Don't forget to hit the gong to thank them! I opted for 2 bowls and also tried some different ingredients. I just really like the large options that are available., Review_3: This restaurant is barely worthy of one star. They leave raw food sit out on a buffet. They have a very large disk where they attempt to cook your food. Mine wasn't fully cooked and I got food poisoning. I'm never coming back EVER., Review_4: I like it, the food tastes good, and it's a cool concept.But they're not very clear on what to do and where to go to with the plates. And it's not very clear how much stuff costs, like is a side of rice included?, Review_5: The food was decent but the overall experience is not. The process of creating your bowl is not fun and is very difficult to manage if you have small children in tow. The place was also a mess with virtually every point being point being dirty. We have no intention of ever returning again., Review_6: Our server was extremely rude. She was slamming utensils and rolling her eyes constantly. No greetings and was not tentative.

Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish., Review_5: Place has been on a slide last few years. Loved the food when they first opened. As a NY transplant I was happy to have Ray's nearby. Disappointing crust had a cardboard texture. So little sauce that the pizza was dry. Cheese not fully melted. The crust ends were skinny and poorly formed. Slightly better than frozen supermarket pizza., Review_6: Not a fan, not even a little bit. Underwhelmed by the overall taste and the sauce on the slice, which I think is the most significant ingredient was bland. Not likely to give Ray a chance to make a second impression., Review_7: Yummy pizza! Every time I got they are super nice and the pizza is delicious.

Wasn't even given forks / knives with the food, and took up to 15 minutes to flag the waitress down who seemed to ignore it at first. Won't be returning to this place. Save your money and go elsewhere., Review_8: This is a nice place! Clean and respectable, I went with a friend and my teen son. The food was good very tasty. I was disappointed at the rib. They were good but too small and they looked prepackaged. The waitress was really friendly and attentive. Lots of T.V's was a good thing as we went for super bowl.",

                "This place is clean, and there's a pretty nice patio, which is the main selling point of the venue, but the food and service are not consistent. Sometimes, the servers forget things and can have an attitude and be downright rude. The food is what is expected from a typical pub. There is a fantastic beer selection, including several options on tap.There are also many large televisions for sports.",
                "The main draw of this pub-style restaurant is the patio. It is a good place to sit and have some drinks. The food, however, is mediocre, and the service is just bad, from inattentive to downright rude servers. This is an OK place to have drinks on the patio, but is not recommended at all for the food."

Some of the best staff you can ask for, great bands, and of course d.j. and karaoke. Everything you need for a good night in one place!, Review_2: Great old bar with historical roots. Good service, great drinks and decent food. Real draw is Friday and Saturday night after ten thirty to eleven, it ceases to be a bar and becomes a local party. Beautiful women frequently dance and need a partner., Review_3: This isn't the best or worst. It's just another (better than most). I start by saying. I wanted to check so I called asking 'Do you have Karaoke?' .yes. and yes I know they do. But don't go out there on a hot Saturday-Country-Line-Danceing-Night and expect to sing Karaokie. Not that the alternative is bad., Review_4: Solid performance. Good music, drinks and fun! Sometimes it takes a while to get a drink though. The bar is always slammed! There was a guy getting a little to handsey with me and the bouncer checked him right away.:), Review_5: Great place.... good music... good service cash only you got to love that... old school country bar.... but they have a DJ that plays dance music all night why drive all the way downtown for a cold beer and good music, Review_6: This review is solely for their nightlife as I was completely unaware that they serve food other than the hot dog cart outside at 2am.How many places can you say play country in one room and hip hop in the other? I feel it, I feel it. It's a people watching GOLDMINE., Review_7: Great burgers. Awesome chili. A little fancy for some. Cash only. For you folks from the upper midwest, this place has a Grain Belt light above one of the tables. I feel like I'm right back in Stearns County when I'm at Roman's. Minus the 99 inches of snow of course., Review_8: I absolutely love this bar!! Everyone is so friendly whenever I go there. They have darts, shuffleboard, karaoke, live bands, and dancing. I definitely recommend going here!! The only catch is they only take cash",

                "The bar is well-known for its country music, cold beer, and good food.  Line dancing is offered for those interested, and on occasion a DJ will play modern hip hop music.  The bar is usually busy so come prepared to look for a spot and be surrounded by fellow country-music fans.",
                "An old-fashion bar that specializes in country, and have just switched to playing only all country music. To go along with the old-school attitude is the fact that only cash is accepted as payment. There is karaoke, good food, games, and of course dancing that last all night.",
                "This is a great old country bar with historical roots. The quality of the service is excellent and the staff are all very friendly and professional. There is an on-site DJ, karaoke, live bands and lots of dancing. Great music, good food and ice cold beer all in one place."
