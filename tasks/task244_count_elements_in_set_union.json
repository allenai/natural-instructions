    "Definition": "In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the union of two given sets. A Set is shown by two curly braces and comma-separated numbers inside, like {1, 2, 3}. Union of two given sets is the smallest set which contains all the elements of both the sets. To find the union of two given sets, A and B is a set that consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B such that no element is repeated.",
