        "Binary Classification"
    ],
    "Definition": "We would like you to classify each of the following sets of argument pairs (discussing Death Penalty)  into either SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR. A pair of arguments is considered SIMILAR if the arguments are about the same FACET (making the same argument), and is considered NOT SIMILAR if they do not have the same FACET. A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sent1: Therefore, people will think twice before they choose to commit a crime and also, the death penalty has been proven to deter the crime rate. \n Sent2: i think the death penalty should be abolished because some people are sentenced to deathfor a crime they might have not committed.",
            "output": "Not similar",
            "explanation": "The two arguments are talking about totally different things. The first one says we should have death penaly since it can deter the crime rate, and the second says we should abolish death penalty since people may not have committed the crime they are accused of."

            "input": "Sent1: Death penalty cases involve a lot of appeals and the lawyers are really expensive. \n Sent2: Death penalty cases cost way more because they usual go through a series of costly appeals.",

            "explanation": "These two are considered similar arguments because they are both talking about the cost of death penalty cases."

    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sent1: The death penalty has never been shown to be a deterent to murder. \n Sent2: In addition, it is evident that the death penalty does not deter murder rates.",
            "output": "Not similar",
