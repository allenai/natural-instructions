A regulation pursuant to Article 1 may stipulate that it shall apply with retroactive effect to agreements and concerted practices to which, at the date of entry into force of that regulation, a decision issued with retroactive effect in pursuance of Article 6 of Regulation No 17 would have applied. 1. A regulation pursuant to Article 1 may stipulate that the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) of the Treaty shall not apply, for such period as shall be fixed by that regulation, to agreements and concerted practices already in existence on 13 March 1962 which do not satisfy the conditions of Article 85 (3), where: - within three months from the entry into force of the Regulation, they are so modified as to satisfy the said conditions in accordance with the provisions of the regulation ; and- the modifications are brought to the notice of the Commission within the time limit fixed by the regulation.2.

Where the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue such documentary proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath made by the person concerned before a judicial or administrative authority, a notary, or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country whence that person comes.3. Documents issued in accordance with paragraph 1 or with paragraph 2 may not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.4. Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 8, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue these documents and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.5. Where in the host Member State proof of financial standing is required, that State shall regard certificates issued by banks in the country of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes as equivalent to certificates issued in its own territory.

If, for a factor or for a component taken into account at any stage, the tax burden at previous stages has not been calculated in accordance with Article 4, the bourden on that factor or that component may be increased at a standard rate of 50 %. If, however, the amount of the tax burden on that factor or that component is due to the application of a special rate, that amount must be recalculated before application of the standard rate, on the basis of the standard rate of turnover tax. Where that special rate covers one or more previous stages, the burden resulting from the application of that rate shall not be increased at a standard rate.2. The burden thus calculated for previous stages may not exceed that which would result from applying Articles 4 and 6 to that factor or component. If, for a factor or component taken into account at any stage, an average rate exists, that may be used for calculating the previous tax burden on that factor or that component where it is in accordance with Article 97. This rate shall be applied if it is supported by calculations submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 10. 1. Where, in the case of a product or group of products, a Member State does not calculate the average tax burden in accordance with Articles 2 to 6, that burden may be estimated at a standard rate corresponding to 100 %, 75 %, 50 % or 30 % of the standard rate of turnover tax, according to whether the factors and components of the product or group of products which may be taken into account at the final stage and are liable to the standard rate or to the increased rate of turnover tax represent 65 %, 50 %, 35 % or less than 35 %, respectively, of the selling price of the product or group of products before tax.2. The burden thus estimated may not exceed the average tax burden which would result from applying Articles 2, 3, 4 and 6. The average rates shall be rounded to the next half point above or below according to whether the decimal fraction of the rate obtained reaches or does not reach 0 775 or 0 725. After consulting the Member States, the Commission shall, if necessary, lay down by directive the procedure for application of Articles 1 to 8. 01. Where a Member State intends to introduce or to alter an average rate, it shall submit to the Commission the calculations by which the average tax burden was established in accordance with Articles 1 to 8.2. Where the Commission considers that a tax burden established at a standard rate in accordance with Article 5 or 7 exceeds the limits set in paragraph 2 of those Articles, the Member State shall submit to the Commission, on request, the calculation by which that burden was established under Articles 2, 3, 4 and 6. 1Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they subsequently adopt in the field covered by this Directive.This Directive is addressed to the Member States.",

Quantities of fuel specified by a Member State pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs shall be the same irrespective of the Member State in which the commercial motor vehicle is registered. In no case may measures adopted by a Member State pursuant to this Directive be less favourable than those applied by that Member State to commercial motor vehicles registered in third countries and travelling across common frontiers between Member States. 1. Each Member State may, after consulting the Commission, limit the quantities admitted duty-free in pursuance of Article 3 (2) as regards commercial motor vehicles performing international transport operations into its frontier zone to a depth not exceeding twenty-five kilometres as the crow flies.2.

Member States shall grant the nationals referred to in Article 1 the right to leave their territory in order to take up activities as employed persons and to pursue such activities in the territory of another Member State. Such right shall be exercised simply on production of a valid identity card or passport. Members of the family shall enjoy the same right as the national on whom they are dependent.2. Member States shall, acting in accordance with their laws, issue to such nationals, or renew, an identity card or passport, which shall state in particular the holder s nationality.3. The passport must be valid at least for all Member States and for countries through which the holder must pass when travelling between Member States. Where a passport is the only document on which the holder may lawfully leave the country, its period of validity shall be not less than five years.4. Member States may not demand from the nationals referred to in Article 1 any exit visa or any equivalent document. 1. Member States shall allow the persons referred to in Article 1 to enter their territory simply on production of a valid identity card or passport.2. No entry visa or equivalent document may be demanded save from members of the family who are not nationals of a Member State. Member States shall accord to such persons every facility for obtaining any necessary visas. 1. Member States shall grant the right of residence in their territory to the persons referred to in  1 OJ No 268, 6.11.1967, p. 10. 2 OJ No 298, 7.12.1967, p. 10. 3 OJ No L 257, 19.10.1968, p. 2. 4 OJ No 56, 4.4.1964, p. 850/64.  Article 1 who are able to produce the documents listed in paragraph 3.2. As proof of the right of residence, a document entitled 'Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the EEC' shall be issued. This document must include a statement that it has been issued pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and to the measures taken by the Member States for the implementation of the present Directive. The text of such statement is given in the Annex to this Directive.3. For the issue of a Residence Permit for a National of a Member State of the EEC, Member States may require only the production of the following documents;  - by the worker:    (a) the document with which he entered their territory;(b) a confirmation of engagement from the employer or a certificate of employment;- by the members of the worker s family:    (c) the document with which they entered the territory;(d) a document issued by the competent authority of the State of origin or the State whence they came, proving their relationship;(e) in the cases referred to in Article 10 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, a document issued by the competent authority of the State of origin or the State whence they came, testifying that they are dependent on the worker or that they live under his roof in such country.4. A member of the family who is not a national of a Member State shall be issued with a residence document which shall have the same validity as that issued to the worker on whom he is dependent. Completion of the formalities for obtaining a residence permit shall not hinder the immediate beginning of employment under a contract concluded by the applicants. 1. The residence permit:    (a) must be valid throughout the territory of the Member State which issued it;(b) must be valid for at least five years from the date of issue and be automatically renewable.2. Breaks in residence not exceeding six consecutive months and absence on military service shall not affect the validity of a residence permit.3. Where a worker is employed for a period exceeding three months but not exceeding a year in the service of an employer in the host State or in the employ of a person providing services, the host Member State shall issue him a temporary residence permit, the validity of which may be limited to the expected period of the employment.Subject to the provisions of Article 8 (1) (c), a temporary residence permit shall be issued also to a seasonal worker employed for a period of more than three months. The period of employment must be shown in the documents referred to in paragraph 4 (3) (b). 1. A valid residence permit may not be withdrawn from a worker solely on the grounds that he is no longer in employment, either because he is temporarily incapable of work as a result of illness or accident, or because he is involuntarily unemployed, this being duly confirmed by the competent employment office.2. When the residence permit is renewed for the first time, the period of residence may be restricted, but not to less than twelve months, where the worker has been involuntarily unemployed in the Member State for more than twelve consecutive months. 1. Member States shall, without issuing a residence permit, recognise the right of residence in their territory of:   (a) a worker pursuing an activity as an employed person, where the activity is not expected to last for more than three months. The document with which the person concerned entered the territory and a statement by the employer on the expected duration of the employment shall be sufficient to cover his stay ; a statement by the employer shall not, however, be required in the case of workers coming within the provisions of the Council Directive of 25 February 19641 on the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of the activities of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries.(b) a worker who, while having his residence in the territory of a Member State to which he returns as a rule, each day or at least once a week, is employed in the territory of another Member State. The competent authority of the State where he is employed may issue such worker with a special permit valid for five years and automatically renewable;(c) a seasonal worker who holds a contract of employment stamped by the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory he has come to pursue his activity.2. In all cases referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the host Member State may require the worker to report his presence in the territory. 1.

The visa referred to in Article 3 (2) and the stamp referred to in Article 8 (1) (c) shall be free of charge.3. Member States shall take the necessary steps to simplify as much as possible the formalities and procedure for obtaining the documents mentioned in paragraph 1. 0Member States shall not derogate from the provisions of this Directive save on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. 11. This Directive shall not affect the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community which relate to workers with recognised skills in coal mining and steel making, or the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community which deal with the right to take up skilled employment in the field of nuclear energy, or any measures taken in implementation of those Treaties.2.

The restrictions to be abolished shall include in particular those arising out of measures which prevent or limit establishment or the provision of services beneficiaries by the following means:    (a) in Belgium   - the obligation to hold a carte professionelle (Article 1 of the Law 19 February 1965);(b) in Germany   - the requirement that the issue to any foreign national of an authorisation to open a restaurant or hotel be subject to proof of economic necessity (Nachweis eines Bedürfnisses) (Gaststättengesetz of 28 April 1930, paragraph 1 (2));  1International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M No 4, Rev. 1, New York, 1958).(c) in France      - the obligation to hold a carte d identité d étranger commerçant décret-loi of 12 November 1938, décret of 2 February 1939, Law of 8 October 1940);- exclusion from the right to renew commercial leases (décret of 30 September 1953, Article 38);- the rule preventing foreign nationals from pursuing the occupation of retailer of beverages for consumption on the premises (Code des débits de boissons et des mesures contre l alcoolisme, Article L 31, decret 55-222 of 8 February 1955, ordonnance No 59-107 of 7 January 1959);(d) in Italy   - the rule that only persons of Italian nationality may pursue the occupation of manager of mountain refuge huts (Gestore di rifugi alpini) (Decreto del Commissario per il Turismo of 29 October 1955, Article 13);(e) in Luxembourg      - the limited period of validity of authorisations granted to foreign nationals (Law of 2 June 1962, Article 21);- the requirement that any person wishing to open an inn (auberge), tavern (cabaret), or other premises for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages shall have resided in the Grand Duchy for a continuous period of not less than five years (Law of 12 August 1927, Article 1). 1. Member States shall ensure that beneficiaries have the right to join professional or trade organisations under the same conditions and with the same rights and obligations as their own nationals.2. The right to join professional or trade organisations shall, in the case of establishment, entail eligibility for election or appointment to high office in such organisations. However such posts may be reserved for nationals where, in pursuance of any provision laid down by law or regulation, the organisation concerned is involved in the exercise of official authority.3.

The activities in question are those covered by the Council Directive of 15 October 1968 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in the personal services sector (ISIC ex Major Group 85) ; 1 : Restaurants, cafes, taverns and other drinking and eating places (ISIC Group 852) ; 2 : Hotels, rooming houses, camps and other lodging places (ISIC Group 853). Where, according to the laws of a Member State, certain activities fall not within the personal services sector but rather within the food manufacturing and beverage industries, the appropriate Directive laying down detailed provisions concerning transitional measures in the field in question shall apply to those activities in that Member State. Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is subject to possession of certain qualifications shall ensure that any beneficiary who applies therefor be provided, before he establishes himself or before he begins to pursue any activity on a temporary basis, with information as to the rules governing the occupation which he proposes to pursue. 1. Where, in a Member State, the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is dependent on the possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods:    (a) three consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) two consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary can prove that for the occupation in question he has received previous training, attested by a certificate recognised by the State, or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements ; or(c) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary can prove that he has pursued the occupation in question for at least three years in a non-independent capacity ; or  1OJ No L 260, 22.10.1968, p. 9.(d) three consecutive years in a non-independent capacity, where the beneficiary can prove that for the occupation in question he has received previous training, attested by a certificate recognised by the State, or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.The host Member State may require of nationals of other Member States, in so far as it so requires of its own nationals, that the activity in question should have been pursued, and vocational training received, in the branch of trade in the host country in which the beneficiary wishes to establish himself.2. In the cases referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of paragraph 1 pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than ten years before the date when the application provided for in Article 6 (2) is made. However, where a shorter period is laid down in a Member State for its nationals, that period may also be applied in respect of beneficiaries. 1. Where, in a Member State, the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is not subject to the possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge or ability, that State may, if serious difficulties result from the application of the Council Directive referred to in Article 1 (2), request from the Commission authorisation, for a limited period and in respect of one or more specified activities, to require from nationals of other Member States who wish to pursue those activities in its territory proof that they possess the qualifications required for the pursuit of such activities, either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, in the country whence they come.Use shall not be made of this power in respect of a person who comes from a country which does not make the taking up of the activity in question subject to proof of particular knowledge, or in respect of a person who has lived in the host country for at least five years.2. On receipt of a request from the Member State concerned stating the reasons on which it is based, the Commission shall forthwith specify the conditions on which the authorisation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article will be granted and lay down detailed rules concerning its implementation. 1. A person shall be regarded as having pursued an activity in a managerial capacity within the meaning of Articles 4 and 5 if he has pursued such activity in an industrial or commercial undertaking in the field in question:    (a) as manager of an undertaking or manager of a branch of an undertaking ; or(b) as deputy to the proprietor or to the manager of an undertaking, where such post involves responsibility equivalent to that of the proprietor or manager represented ; or(c) in a managerial post with duties of a type normally pertaining to the occupation in question and with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking.2. Proof that the conditions laid down in Article 4 (1) or in Article 5 (1) are satisfied shall be established by certificates issued by the competent authority or body in the country whence the person concerned comes, which such person shall submit in support of his application for authorisation to pursue the activity or activities in question in the host country.3. Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 8, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue these certificates and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof. The provisions of this Directive shall remain applicable until the entry into force of provisions relating to the co-ordination of national rules concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question.

When recording the most favourable purchasing opportunities in international trade, account shall be taken of all information on:    1. free-at-frontier prices ruling in the Community for products imported from third countries:2. prices on the markets of third countries, known to the Commission either direct or through Member States. When recording the most favourable purchasing opportunities in international trade, account shall not be taken of information:    1. relating to a small quantity unrepresentative of trade in the product in question;2. in respect of which price trends in general or other information available to it lead the Commission to believe that the price in question is unrepresentative of the real trend of the market. 1. Prices referred to in Article 3 which do not apply    (a) free-at-Community-frontier,(b) to products of good marketable quality, shall be adjusted.2. Prices referred to in Article 3 which apply to an assimilated product the levy on which is equal to the levy on the related pilot product shall be adjusted by taking account, in particular, of differences of      (a) composition,(b) maturity,(c) quality,(d) presentation,between the assimilated product and the related pilot product.Adjustments relating to composition shall be calculated by multiplying the difference between the milk component content of the pilot product and that of the assimilated product in question by the value attributed in international trade to a unit of weight of the milk component in question.Other adjustments shall be calculated with reference to the difference between the value attributed on the Community market to each of the relevant characteristics of the pilot product and the value attributed on that market to the corresponding characteristic of the assimilated product in question. When information on prices is not available the free-at-frontier price may be determined exceptionally on the basis of:    1. the value of the raw materials contained in the pilot product in question calculated on the basis of the prices of milk products for which prices are available,2. average processing costs,3. average yield. A free-at-frontier price may exceptionally be maintained unchanged for a limited period when:    1. the price for a given quality or origin which served as a basis for determining the previous  free-at-frontier price has not come to the knowledge of the Commission in time for determining the next free-at-frontier price, and2. the prices available, which the Commission does not regard as sufficiently representative of the real trend of the market, would entail sudden, substantial alterations in the free-at-frontier price. 1. Levies shall be fixed every fortnight. They shall, however, be altered in the intervening period if necessary.For the purposes of this Article, 'fortnight' means a period from the 1st to the 15th or from the 16th to the last day of a month.2. The levy on a product shall apply until another levy on the same product becomes applicable.3. Save express exceptions, levies shall be fixed in units of account per 100 kilogrammes. 1. For products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2, the component of the levy fixed by means of a coefficient expressing the weight ratio between the milk powder contained in the product and the product itself shall be calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the quantity of milk powder contained in the product.The basic amount shall be one-hundredth part of the levy    (a) on the pilot product of group No 2 in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2 (aa),(b) on the pilot product of group No 3, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2 (bb),(c) calculated in accordance with Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 823/68, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B I (b) 2 (cc).2. For products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 II (b), the component of the levy fixed by means of a coefficient expressing the weight ratio between the milk components contained in the product and the product itself shall be calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the quantity of milk components contained in the product.The basic amount shall be one-hundredth part of the levy    (a) calculated in accordance with Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 823/68, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B II (b) 1,(b) calculated in accordance with Article 5 (3) of that Regulation, in respect of products falling within tariff sub-heading No 04.02 B II (b) 2. 01.

The provisions of this Directive shall apply to activities of self-employed persons engaging in exploration (prospecting and drilling) for petroleum and natural gas being activities falling within Major Group ex 13 in Annex III to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment.These activities correspond to those listed under Group 130 of the Nomenclature of Industries in the European Communities (NICE), which takes into account the particular structure of the European mining and quarrying industries.2. The activities in question comprise the search for deposits of petroleum and natural gas by all appropriate means and all operations preparatory to extraction, including preparation of the site.3. These activities may be pursued: - by undertakings conducting exploration operations on their own behalf but not holding a production licence ; or- by undertakings conducting exploration operations on behalf of others. 1. Member States shall in particular abolish the following restrictions: (a) those which prevent beneficiaries from establishing themselves or providing services in the host country under the same conditions and with the same rights as nationals of that country;(b) those existing by reason of administrative practices which result in treatment being applied to beneficiaries that is discriminatory by comparison with that applied to nationals;(c) those which, as a result of rules or practices, prevent beneficiaries from being granted licences or authorisations, or subject beneficiaries to restrictions or to conditions imposed on them alone;(d) those which exclude beneficiaries from pursuing an activity within a professional or trade organisation.2. The restrictions to be abolished shall include in particular those arising out of measures which prevent or limit establishment or provision of services by beneficiaries by the following means: (a) in Belgium: - the obligation to hold a carte professionelle (Article 1 of the Law of 19 February 1965);(b) in France: - the obligation to hold a carte d identité d étranger commerçant (Décret-loi of 12 November 1938, Décret of 2 February 1939, law of 8 October 1940);(c) in Italy: - the requirement, in connection with the issue of licences for petroleum and natural gas exploration (by prospecting and drilling) that a person shall be of Italian nationality or, in the case of a company or firm, that it have its registered office in Italy, or that there be reciprocal arrangements (Law No 613 of 21 July 1967, Law No 28 of the Region of Trentino-Alto Adige of 21 November 1958, Law No 45 of the Region of Sardinia of 8 November 1968).

For calculating the average price referred to in the second indent of Article 4 of this Regulation, the average price obtained by member producers for each of the three calendar years preceding that in which they joined the organisation shall be determined: - on the basis of available commercial and accounting documents admissible as evidence, or, where no such proof is available,- by calculating the average price ruling for each product on the most representative producer market for the area in which the head office of the producers' organisation in question is situated, this average price being the average of the representative prices recorded in that market by the competent authorities of the Member State during the year under consideration, account being taken, where necessary, of seasonal variations in production. 1.

For the purposes of this Directive 'honey' shall mean the foodstuff which is produced by the honey-bee from the nectar of blossoms or secretions of or on living parts of plants, and which the bees collect, transform, combine with specific substances of their own and store and leave to mature in honey combs. This foodstuff may be fluid, viscous or crystallized.2. The main types of honey are as follows:    (a) according to originblossom honey:honey obtained predominantly from the nectar of blossoms;  (1)OJ No L 291, 19.11.1969, p. 9.honeydew honey:honey obtained predominantly from secretions of or on living parts of plants ; its colour varies from light or greenish brown to almost black;(b) according to mode of presentationcomb honey:honey stored by bees in the cells of freshly built broodless combs and sold in sealed whole combs or sections of such combs;chunk honey:honey which contains one or more pieces of comb honey;drained honey:honey obtained by draining decapped broodless combs;extracted honey:honey obtained by centrifuging decapped broodless combs;pressed honey:honey obtained by pressing broodless combs with or without the application of moderate heat; Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that honey may be offered for sale only if it conforms to the definitions and rules laid down in this Directive and in the Annex thereto. 1. The term 'honey' shall be applied only to the product defined in Article 1 (1) and must be used in trade to designate that product, without prejudice to the provisions laid down in Article 7 (1) (a) and (2).2. The names referred to in Article 1 (2) shall be applied only to the products defined there in. By way of derogation from Article 3 (1) the terms 'Kunsthonning' and 'Kunsthonig' may continue to be used in Denmark and in Germany respectively for a period of five years starting from the date of notification of this Directive, to describe a product other than honey, in accordance with the national provisions governing this product in force at the time of the notification of this Directive. No product other than honey may be added to honey offered for sale as such. 1. When it is marketed the honey shall comply with the compositional criteria listed in the Annex.However, by way of derogation from the second indent of paragraph 2 of the said Annex, Member States may authorize in their own territory:    (a) the marketing of heather honey with a maximum moisture content of 25 %, if this is the result of natural conditions of production,(b) the marketing of 'baker s honey' in 'industrial honey' with a moisture content of not more than 25 %, if this is the result of natural conditions of production.2. In addition:    (a) honey shall, as far as practicable, be free from organic or inorganic matters foreign to its composition, such as mould, insects, insect debris, brood or grains of sand, when the honey is marketed as such or is used in any product for human consumption;(b) honey shall not:      (i) have any foreign tastes or odours;(ii) have begun to ferment or effervesce;(iii) have been heated to such an extent that its natural enzymes are destroyed or made inactive;(iv) have an artificially changed acidity;(c) honey may under no circumstances contain substances in such quantity as to endanger human health.3.

Within five years from the date of notification of this Directive the Council shall decide, on a proposal from the Commission, on provisions designed to lay down identical technical specifications for the entire Community. 1. The only information which is compulsory on the packages, containers or labels of honey, which information must be conspicuous, clearly legible and indelible, shall be the following:    (a) the term 'honey' or one of the names listed in Article 1 (2) ; 'comb honey' and 'chunk honey' must, however, be described as such ; in the cases referred to in subparagraph (b) of the second paragraph of Article 6 (1) and in the first paragraph of Article 6 (3), the name of the product shall be 'baker s honey' or 'industrial honey';(b) the net weight expressed in grammes or kilogrammes;(c) the name or trade name and the address or registered office of the producer or packer, or of a seller established within the Community.2.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Member States may retain any national provisions which require indication of the country of origin. This information, however, may no longer be required for honey originating in the Community.4. The term 'honey' referred to in paragraph 1 (a) or one of the names referred to in Article 1 (2) may be supplemented inter alia by:    (a) a reference to the origin, whether blossom or plant, provided the product comes predominantly from the source indicated and has the appropriate organoleptic, physico-chemical, and microscopic characteristics;(b) a regional, territorial or topographical name, provided the product originates entirely in the area indicated.5. Where honey is put up in packages or containers of a net weight equal to or exceeding 10 kilogrammes and is not retailed, the information referred to in paragraph 1 (b) and (c) may, if desired, appear only on the accompanying documents.6. Member States shall refrain from stating, apart from what is laid down in paragraph 1, how the information referred to in that paragraph is to be given. However, Member States may forbid trade in honey in their territory if the markings laid down in paragraph 1 (a) are not shown on one side of the package or container in the national language or languages.7. Until the end of the transitional period during which the imperial units of measurement contained in Annex II to Council Directive No 71/354/EEC (1) of 18 October 1971 relating to units of measurement which may be used in the Community, Member States may require that the weight should also be expressed in imperial units of measurement.8. Paragraphs 1 to 7 shall apply without prejudice to subsequent provisions laid down by the Community on labelling. 1. Member States shall adopt all the measures necessary to ensure that trade in the products referred to in Article 1, which comply with the definitions and rules laid down in this Directive and in Annex I thereto, shall not be impeded by the application of national non-harmonized provisions governing the composition, manufacturing specifications, packaging or labelling of these products in particular or of foodstuffs in general.2.

The methods of sampling and analysis necessary for checking the composition and characteristics of honey shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10. 01. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be followed, the matter shall be referred to the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs set up by the Council Decision of 13 November 1969 (hereinafter called the 'Committee') by its Chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of a representative of a Member State.2.

For the purposes of this Regulation, the Member States of the Community as originally constituted shall be regarded as a single Member State. 1. Inward processing procedure for the trade referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) shall mean the customs procedure which allows processing in a Member State of the Community of goods imported from another Member State where they satisfy the conditions of Articles 9 and 10 of the Treaty, without payment of:    (a) customs duties;(b) import charges having equivalent effect;(c) other charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or the system of trade as defined in Regulations No 170/67/EEC and (EEC) No 1059/69;when the imported goods are intended to be exported from the customs territory of the Member State of processing wholly or partly in the form of compensating products.2.

Each Member State shall recognize the right to remain permanently in its territory of:    (a) any person who, at the time of termination of his activity, has reached the age laid down by the law of that State for entitlement to an old-age pension and who has pursued his activity in that State for at least the previous twelve months and has resided there continuously for more than three years.Where the law of that Member State does not grant the right to an old-age pension to certain categories of self-employed workers, the age requirement shall be considered as satisfied when the beneficiary reaches 65 years of age;(b) any person who, having resided continuously in the territory of that State for more than two years, ceases to pursue his activity there as a result of permanent incapacity to work.If such incapacity is the result of an accident at work or an occupational illness entitling him to a pension which is payable in whole or in part by an institution of that State no condition shall be imposed as to length of residence;(c) any person who, after three years' continuous activity and residence in the territory of that State, pursues his activity in the territory of another Member State, while retaining his residence in the territory of the first State, to which he returns, as a rule, each day or at least once a week.Periods of activity so completed in the territory of the other Member State shall, for the purposes of entitlement to the rights referred to in (a) and (b), be considered as having been completed in the territory of the State of residence.2. The conditions as to length of residence and activity laid down in paragraph 1 (a) and the condition as to length of residence laid down in paragraph 1 (b) shall not apply if the spouse of the self-employed person is a national of the Member State concerned or has lost the nationality of that State by marriage to that person. 1. Each Member State shall recognize the right of the members of the self-employed person's family referred to in Article 1 who are residing with him in the territory of that State to remain there permanently, if the person concerned has acquired the right to remain in the territory of that State in accordance with Article 2. This provision shall continue to apply even after the death of the person concerned.2. If, however, the self-employed person dies during his working life and before having acquired the right to remain in the territory of the State concerned, that State shall recognize the right of the members of his family to remain there permanently on condition that:    - the person concerned, on the date of his decease, had resided continuously in its territory for at least two years ; or- his death resulted from an accident at work or an occupational illness ; or- the surviving spouse is a national of that State or lost such nationality by marriage to the person concerned. 1. Continuity of residence as provided for in Articles 2 (1) and 3 (2) may be attested by any means of proof in use in the country of residence. It may not be affected by temporary absences not exceeding a total of three months per year, nor by longer absences due to compliance with the obligations of military service.2. Periods of inactivity due to circumstances outside the control of the person concerned or of inactivity owing to illness or accident must be considered as periods of activity within the meaning of Article 2 (1). 1. Member States shall allow the person entitled to the right to remain to exercise such right within two years from the time of becoming entitled thereto pursuant to Article 2 (1) (a) and (b) and Article 3. During this period the beneficiary must be able to leave the territory of the Member State without adversely affecting such right.2. Member States shall not require the person concerned to comply with any particular formality in order to exercise the right to remain. 1. Member States shall recognize the right of persons having the right to remain in their territory to a residence permit, which must:    (a) be issued and renewed free of charge or on payment of a sum not exceeding the dues and taxes payable by nationals for the issue or renewal of identity cards;(b) by valid throughout the territory of the Member State issuing it;(c) be valid for five years and renewable automatically.2. Periods of non-residence not exceeding six consecutive months and longer absences due to compliance with the obligations of military service may not affect the validity of a residence permit. Member States shall apply to persons having the right to remain in their territory the right of equality of treatment recognized by the Council Directives on the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment pursuant to Title III of the General Programme which provides for such abolition. 1. This Directive shall not affect any provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action of any Member State which would be more favourable to nationals of other Member States.2.

This obligation shall not apply to power stations fired by manufactured gases, industrial waste and other fuel derived from waste, nor to private industrial generators with a total capacity of less than 100 MWe.Governments of Member States may, depending on their domestic situation, fix a threshold lower than that referred to above.3. When the obligation to maintain stocks is such to create difficulties of a particularly serious nature for any power station, the competent authority in the Member State concerned may exempt it in full or in part from this obligation. The Member State shall inform the Commission of its decision immediately, stating the reasons for it.4. Stocks shall be held on the premises of the power station or at a place directly linked thereto. Stocks may be held at a place further removed, provided that they can be conveyed to the power station at all times.In the case of power stations fired by natural gas, lignite or peat, the deposit which supplies the station may be considered as station stock, provided there is a guarantee that sufficient quantities can be delivered to ensure the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1, even in the event of difficulties in maintaining fuel supplies to thermal power stations. This shall also apply to power stations fired by coal, provided they are located near the mines which supply them.5. The quantities of fuel to be held at each thermal power station shall be determined by the electricity producers in the light of the possibilities offered by the transmission and interconnection network.Electricity producers may form themselves into groups in order to apportion fuel stocks among their power stations, provided they can guarantee the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1. 1. Each electricity producer shall furnish the competent authority in the Member State concerned with a statement, drawn up on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July and 1 October each year at least, of the stocks held at its thermal power stations specifying the quantities necessary to ensure the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1. These statements shall be forwarded within 30 days of each of the abovementioned dates. Member States shall take the necessary steps to check the accuracy of these statements.2. Member States shall submit to the Commission the statement of the stocks held on 1 April and 1 October of each year at these power stations, specifying the quantities necessary to ensure the continuation of electricity supplies for the period laid down in Article 1. These statements must be forwarded not later than 1 June and 1 December of each year.3. At the request of the Commission, the statements referred to in paragraph 2 shall be made for periods and on dates other than those laid down in that paragraph. If Community thermal power stations experience fuel supply difficulties, electricity producers may, after authorization by the competent authority of the Member State concerned, draw on the minimum stocks built up pursuant to the rules laid down in Article 1.Member States shall inform the Commission of all drawings on stocks and shall make known, as soon as possible:    - the quantities drawn from the stocks and the date on which the stocks fall below the mandatory minimum;- the urgent reasons justifying such drawings;- any measures taken to build up these stocks again;- if possible, probable changes in stock levels during the period in which they remain below the mandatory minimum. Stocks conforming to the provisions of this Directive shall be built up as soon as possible after the date of notification of this Directive and at the latest by 1 January 1978. Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to this end. Any information forwarded pursuant to this Directive shall be confidential.

Member States shall adopt the measures defined in this Directive in respect of establishment or provision of services in their territories by natural persons and companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes (hereinafter called 'beneficiaries') wishing to pursue the activities referred to in Article 2.2. This Directive shall also apply to nationals of Member States who, as provided in Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, wish to pursue as paid employees activities referred to in Article 2. This Directive shall apply to the following itinerant activities:    (a) the buying and selling of goods:      - by itinerant tradesmen, hawkers or pedlars (ex ISIC Group 612);- in covered markets other than from permanently fixed installations and in open-air markets;(b) activities covered by transitional measures already adopted that expressly exclude or do not mention the pursuit of such activities on an itinerant basis. 1. Where a host Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 2 proof of good repute and proof that they have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either one of these, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, the production of an extract from the 'judicial record' or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State whence the foreign national comes showing that these requirements have been met.2. Where a host Member State imposes on its own nationals wishing to take up one of the activities referred to in Article 2, certain requirements as to good repute, and proof that such requirements are satisfied cannot be obtained from the document referred to in paragraph 1, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States, a certificate issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the country of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes, showing that the requirements in question have been met. Such certificate shall relate to the specific facts regarded as relevant by the host country.3. Where the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue the document referred to in paragraph 1 or the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 furnishing proof of good repute or proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in a State where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, or where appropriate, a notary, in the country of origin or the country whence that person comes ; such authority or notary will issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. The declaration in respect of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional or trade body in the said country.  (1)OJ No L 257, 19.10.1968, p. 2.4.

Where in the host Member State proof of financial standing is required, that State shall regard certificates issued by banks in the Member State of origin or in the country whence the foreign national comes as equivalent to certificates issued in its own territory. Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 is subject to possession of certain qualifications shall ensure that any beneficiary who applies therefor be provided, before he establishes himself or before he begins to pursue any activity on a temporary basis, with information as to the rules governing the occupation which he proposes to pursue. 1. Where in a Member State the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 is subject to possession of general, commercial, or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall, subject to Article 6, accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods:    (a) three consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements ; or(c) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that he has pursued the activity in question for at least three years in an non-independent capacity ; or(d) three consecutive years in a non-independent capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.The host Member State may require of nationals of other Member States, in so far as it so requires of its own nationals, that the activity in question should have been pursued, and vocational training received, in the same branch of trade (or in a related branch) as that in which the beneficiary wishes to establish himself in the host Member State.2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity in question shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 8 is made. However, where a shorter period is laid down in a Member State for its own nationals, that period may also be applied in respect of beneficiaries. 1. Notwithstanding Article 5, where in a Member State any activity referred to in Article 2 is regarded as being of an industrial or small craft nature and where the taking up or pursuit of such activity is subject to possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods:    (a) six consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) three consecutive years either in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received at least three years  previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements ; or(c) three consecutive years in an independent capacity, where the beneficiary proves that the has pursued the activity in question for at least five years in a non-independent capacity ; or(d) five consecutive years in a managerial capacity, not less than three years of which were spent in technical posts with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received at least three years   previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by the competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date when the application provided for in Article 8 is made. However, where a shorter period is laid down in a Member State for its own nationals that period may also be applied in respect of beneficiaries. A person shall be regarded as having pursued an activity in a managerial capacity within the meaning of Articles 5 and 6 if he has pursued such an activity in an industrial or commercial undertaking in the occupational field in question:    (a) as manager of an undertaking or manager of a branch of an undertaking ; or(b) as deputy to the proprietor or to the manager of an undertaking, where such post involves responsibility equivalent to that of the proprietor or manager represented ; or(c) in a managerial post with duties of a commercial nature and with responsibility for at least one department of the undertaking. Proof that the conditions laid down in Articles 5 and 6 are satisfied shall be established by a certificate issued by a competent authority or body in the Member State of origin or Member State whence the person concerned comes, which the latter shall submit in support of his application for authorization to pursue the activity or activities in question in the host Member State. For the purpose of applying Article 6 and in so far as is necessary:    1. Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 is subject to possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability shall, with the assistance of the Commission, inform the other Member States of the main characteristics of that occupation;2. the competent authority designated for this purpose by the Member State of origin or the State whence the beneficiary comes shall certify what professional or trade activities were actually pursued by the beneficiary and the duration of those activities. Certificates shall be drawn up having regard to the official description of the occupation in question supplied by the Member State in which the beneficiary wishes to pursue such occupation, whether permanently or temporarily;3. the host Member State shall grant authorization to pursue the activity in question on application by the person concerned, provided that the activity certified conforms to the main features of the description of the occupation communicated pursuant to point 1 and provided that any other requirements laid down by the rules of that State are satisfied. 0Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 12, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the certificates referred to in Articles 8 and 9 and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof. 1The transitional provisions laid down in this Directive shall remain applicable until the entry into force of provisions relating to the coordination of national rules concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question. 2Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive within 12 months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 3Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 4This Directive is addressed to the Member States.",

Ground water, brackish water and water intended to replenish  (1)OJ No C 62, 30.5.1974, p. 7. (2)OJ No C 109, 19.9.1974, p. 41. (3)OJ No C 112, 20.12.1973, p. 3.water-bearing beds shall not be subject to this Directive.2. For the purposes of applying this Directive, all surface water intended for human consumption and supplied by distribution networks for public use shall be considered to be drinking water. For the purposes of this Directive surface water shall be divided according to limiting values into three categories, A1, A2 and A3, which correspond to the appropriate standard methods of treatment given in Annex I. These groups correspond to three different qualities of surface water, the respective physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of which are set out in the table given in Annex II. 1. Member States shall set, for all sampling points, or for each individual sampling point, the values applicable to surface water for all the parameters given in Annex II.Member States may refrain from setting the values of parameters in respect of which no value is shown, in the table in Annex II, pursuant to the first subparagraph pending determination of the figures in accordance with the procedure under Article 9.2. The values set pursuant to paragraph 1 may not be less stringent than those given in the 'I' columns of Annex II.3. Where values appear in the 'G' columns of Annex II, whether or not there is a corresponding value in the 'I' columns of that Annex, Member States shall endeavour to respect them as guidelines, subject to Article 6. 1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that surface water conforms to the values laid down pursuant to Article 3. Each Member State shall apply this Directive without distinction to national waters and waters crossing its frontiers.2. In line with the objectives of this Directive, Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure continuing improvement of the environment. To this end, they shall draw up a systematic plan of action including a timetable for the improvement of surface water and especially that falling within category A3. In this context, considerable improvements are to be achieved under the national programmes over the next 10 years.The timetable referred to in the first subparagraph will be drawn up in the light of the need to improve the quality of the environment, and of water in particular, and the economic and technical constraints which exist or which may arise in the various regions of the Community.The Commission will carry out a thorough examination of the plans referred to in the first subparagraph, including the timetables, and will, if necessary, submit appropriate proposals to the Council.3. Surface water having physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics falling short of the mandatory limiting values corresponding to treatment type A3 may not be used for the abstraction of drinking water. However, such lower quality water may, in exceptional circumstances, be utilized provided suitable processes - including blending - are used to bring the quality characteristics of the water up to the level of the quality standards for drinking water. The Commission must be notified of the grounds for such exceptions, on the basis of a water resources management plan within the area concerned, as soon as possible, in the case of existing installations, and in advance, in the case of new installations. The Commission will examine these grounds in detail and, where necessary, submit appropriate proposals to the Council. 1. For the purposes of Article 4 surface water shall be assumed to conform to the relevant parameters if samples of this water taken at regular intervals at the same sampling point and used in the abstraction of drinking water show that it complies with the parametric values for the water quality in question, in the case of:    - 95 % of the samples for parameters conforming to those specified in the 'I' columns in Annex II,- 90 % of the samples in all other cases,and if in the case of the 5 or 10 % of the samples which do not comply:      (a) the water does not deviate from the parametric values in question by more than 50 %, except  for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and microbiological parameters;(b) there can be no resultant danger to public health;(c) consecutive water samples taken at statistically suitable intervals do not deviate from the relevant parametric values.2. Pending a Community policy on the matter, the frequency of sampling and the analysis of each parameter, together with the methods of measurement shall be defined by the competent national authorities which shall take into account the volume of water abstracted, the extent of the abstraction, the population served, the degree of risk engendered by the quality of the water and seasonal variations in the quality.3. Higher values than those referred to in paragraph 2, shall not be taken into consideration in the calculation of the percentages referred to in paragraph 1 when they are the result of floods or natural disasters or abnormal weather conditions.4. Sampling shall mean the place at which surface water is abstracted before being sent for purification treatment. Member States may at any time fix more stringent values for surface water than those laid down in this Directive. Implementation of the measures taken pursuant to this Directive may under no circumstances lead either directly or indirectly to deterioration of the current quality of surface water. This Directive may be waived:    (a) in the case of floods or other natural disasters;(b) in the case of certain parameters marked (O) in Annex II because of exceptional meteorological or geographical conditions;(c) where surface water undergoes natural enrichment in certain substances as a result of which it would exceed the limits laid down for categories A1, A2 and A3 in the table in Annex II;(d) in the case of surface water in shallow lakes or virtually stagnant surface water, for parameters marked with an asterisk in the table in Annex II, this derogation being applicable only to lakes with a depth not exceeding 20 m, with an exchange of water slower than one year, and without a discharge of waste water into the water body.Natural enrichment means the process whereby, without human intervention, a given body of water receives from the soil certain substances contained therein.In no case may the exceptions provided for in the first subparagraph disregard the requirements of public health protection.Where a Member State waives the provisions of this Directive, it shall forthwith notify the Commission thereof, stating its reasons and the periods anticipated. The numerical values and the list of parameters given in the table in Annex II, defining the physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of surface water may be revised either at the request of a Member State or on a proposal from the Commission, whenever technical and scientific knowledge regarding methods of treatment is extended or drinking water standards are modified. 0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions needed in order to comply with this Directive within two years of its notification. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 1This Directive is addressed to the Member States.",

Paragraph 1 shall not apply to gas oil:    - used in power stations,- used by shipping,- contained in the fuel tanks of inland waterway vessels or of motor vehicles travelling from one zone to another or crossing a frontier between a non-member state and a Member State. 1. Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that:    - type A gas oil can be marketed in the Community only if its sulphur compound content, expressed in sulphur, does not exceed 0.5 % by weight as from 1 October 1976 and 0.3 % by weight as from 1 October 1980,- type B gas oil can be marketed in the Community only if its sulphur compound content, expressed in sulphur, does not exceed 0.8 % by weight as from 1 October 1976 and 0.5 % by weight as from 1 October 1980.2. Should environmental requirements or the state of desulphurizing technology change appreciably or should the economic situation in the Community as regards the supply of crude oil change substantially, the Commission may, on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State, propose amendments to the sulphur content indicated in paragraph 1 for the period beginning 1 October 1980. The Council may decide on such amendments, by a qualified majority, not later than 1 October 1977.3. If, because of a sudden change in crude oil supplies, changes should occur in the sulphur content of the oil such as to jeopardize supplies to consumers in view of the shortage of available desulphurization capacity, a Member State may allow onto its territory gas oils which do not conform to the specifications laid down in paragraph 1. It shall forthwith notify the Commission, which shall, after consulting the other Member States decide within three months on the duration and details of the derogation.4. The application of paragraph 1 for the second stage of the programme for reducing the sulphur content in gas oil may be deferred until 1 October 1985 by the Government of Ireland. The Member States may implement the provisions of Article 2 (1) more rapidly than is provided for therein. As from the dates of application laid down in Article 2, due account being taken of Article 3, the Member States may not prohibit, restrict or impede the marketing of gas oils, on the grounds of sulphur content, provided they comply with the requirements of this Directive. Member States shall determine the zones in which the use of type B gas oil is permitted. They shall inform the other Member States and the Commission of their decisions and of their reasons for taking them. The Commission shall monitor the effects of applying this Directive, with particular reference to Articles 2 and 5 and will, as appropriate, depending on new information available on atmospheric sulphur dioxide pollution levels recorded and progress towards determining Community air quality objectives, draw up suitable proposals not later than 1 October 1980. 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to check by sampling the sulphur content of gas oils which are marketed.2. The reference method adopted for determining the sulphur content of gas oils which are marketed is defined by European Standard EN 41, (first edition November 1975).Pending the entry into force of European Standard EN 41, the checks and statistical interpretation of the results of these checks will be made according to the standard in use in the country in whose territory the gas oils are marketed.Failing a national standrard, the statistical interpretation of the results of the checks made to determine the sulphur content of the gas oils marketed shall be made according to standard BS 4306/1968 'Application of precision data to specifications for petroleum products'. 1. Member States shall implement the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions for compliance with this Directive within nine months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.2.

In order that the conditions referred to in Article 8 (3) of Protocol 1 to the Agreement be met, the prices on representative Community markets recorded at, or converted to, the import/wholesale stage must, for a given product, be equal to or higher than the price defined in Article 3.The prices referred to in the first paragraph shall be taken into account after customs clearance and deduction of import charges other than customs duties - the charges being those used in calculating the entry price referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.The price for the product in question may be calculated for Class I pursuant to the third indent, second subparagraph of Article 24 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.2. The Commission shall calculate the amount to be deducted in respect of import charges other than customs duties, which are referred to in the third indent of Article 24 (3) or Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 - in so far as prices notified to the Commission by Member States include these charges - so as to avoid any difficulties arising from the effect of these charges on entry prices which may vary according to origin. Accordingly, an average mean corresponding to the arithmetical mean between the lowest and the highest charges shall be taken into account for the calculation.The detailed rules for applying this paragraph shall be determined, as may be necessary, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.3. The representative Community markets within the meaning of paragraph 1 are those used for recording the prices on the basis of which the entry price referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 is calculated. The price referred to in Article 2 (1) shall be equal to the reference price in force for that period plus the customs duties thereon for imports from third countries and a fixed charge of 1.20 units of account per 100 kilogrammes. Where the prices referred to in Article 2 (1), after customs clearance and deduction of import charges other than customs duties, remain lower on the lowest priced representative Community markets than the price laid down in Article 3 for three consecutive market days, the customs duty in force for imports from third countries at the date of importation shall apply to that product.

The Commission, on the basis of prices recorded on representative Community markets and notified by Member States, shall follow price trends regularly and record them in accordance with Article 4.The measures required for this purpose shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 for applying compensatory charges to fruit and vegetables.

The following shall be taken into account when refunds are being fixed:    (a) the existing situation and future trends with regard to:      - prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market,- prices for rice and for broken rice on the world market;(b) the aims of the common organization of the market in rice, which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market;(c) the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market ; and(d) the economic aspect of the proposed exports. Refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76, with the exception of those listed in Article 1 (c) of that Regulation, shall be fixed in accordance with the following specific criteria:    (a) prices for those products ruling on the various representative export markets of the Community;(b) the most favourable quotations recorded on the various markets of importing third countries ; and(c) marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from the Community markets referred to in (a) to ports or other points of export in the Community serving these markets, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the world market. 1. The refund on the products listed in Article 1 (1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 may be fixed, where appropriate, by a tendering procedure. Such tendering procedure shall relate to the amount of the refund.2. Detailed rules for the application of paragraph 1 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76. 1. The refund may be increased by a compensatory amount in respect of stocks of paddy rice harvested within the Community and of husked rice obtained therefrom, in hand at the end of a marketing year and forming part of that year's crop, which are exported in the natural state or in the form of wholly milled rice or semi-milled rice between the beginning of the following marketing year and dates still to be determined.Before 1 July of each year the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall, if necessary, determine the products to which the provisions of the preceding subparagraph shall apply.2. The compensatory amount shall be:    - in the case of husked rice, equal to the difference between the target price valid for the last month of the marketing year and that valid for the first month of the new marketing year,- in the case of paddy rice, equal to that difference adjusted by the conversion rate.This amount shall however be reduced by the amount of any carry-over payment already granted, pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76.3. The compensatory amount shall be granted only if stocks reach a minimum level. Where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary, the refund on the products referred to in Article 3 may be varied according to use or destination. If the export refund on paddy rice or semi-milled rice is fixed in advance, the adjustment by reference to the threshold price which will be in force at the time of exportation, as provided for in Article 17 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76, shall be made taking into account the conversion rates determined pursuant to Article 19 (a) of that Regulation. 1. The refund on the products referred to in Article 3 shall be paid upon proof:     - that the products have been exported from the Community, and- that the products, in the case of paddy rice and husked rice, are of Community origin, except where Article 10 applies.2. Where Article 6 applies, the refund shall be paid under the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, provided it is proved that the product has reached the destination for which the refund was fixed.Exception may be made to this rule in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 3, provided that conditions are laid down which offer equivalent guarantees.3. Additional provisions may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76. The refunds on the products referred to in Article 3 shall be fixed at least once a month. 0No export refund shall be granted on paddy rice and husked rice which is imported from third countries and re-exported to third countries, unless the exporter proves:    - that the product to be exported and the product previously imported are one and the same, and- that the levy was collected on importation.In such cases, the refund on each product shall be equal to the levy collected on importation where this levy is lower than the refund applicable on the day of exportation ; the refund shall be equal to the refund applicable on the day of exportation where the levy collected on importation is higher than this refund. 11.

Where difficulties arise in the supply of crude oil and/or petroleum products in one or more Member States, the Commission, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative and after holding consultations within the group provided for in Directive 73/238/EEC, may decide to make intra-Community trade in products falling within heading No 27.09 and subheadings 27.10 A, B, C I and C II of the Common Customs Tariff subject to a system of licences to be granted automatically by the exporting Member State.Licences shall be granted without delay and free of administrative charges in respect of any quantity requested and for a minimum period of 15 working days and a maximum of one month.2. Where intervention by the Commission has been requested by a Member State, the Commission shall take a decision within a maximum of five working days of the date of receipt of that request.3. This decision shall not affect supplies of goods from third countries to a Member State which are in transit through other Member States.4. Any decision taken by the Commission to introduce a system of licences, pursuant to paragraph 1, shall be communicated to the Council and to the Member States. Any Member State may, within 10 working days of the date of communication, refer that decision to the Council. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may repeal the decision of the Commission or alter the conditions and procedures laid down therein.5. Decisions taken by the Commission shall apply as soon as they have been communicated to Member States. They shall not apply to products which have already been dispatched. Whenever a shortfall in supply of crude oil and/or petroleum products, either actual or imminent, creates an abnormal increase in trade in petroleum products between Member States, the Commission may, on the request of a Member State, after consulting the group provided for in Directive 73/238/EEC, authorize that Member State to suspend the issue of export licences to the extent necessary to prevent such abnormal trade. The Commission's authorization shall be valid for 10 working days.The Council shall meet, at the request of a Member State, within 48 hours to confirm, amend or repeal, by a qualified majority, the authorization granted by the Commission. If a shortfall is likely to seriously endanger the supply of crude oil and/or petroleum products in a Member State, or if such a situation may reasonably be expected, the Commission may, on the request of a Member State, after consulting the group provided for in Directive 73/238/EEC, authorize that Member State to suspend the issue of export licences, provided that traditional trade patterns are maintained as far as possible.The Council shall meet, at the request of a Member State, within 48 hours to amend or revoke, by a qualified majority, the authorization granted by the Commission. If the Council does not revoke or amend this authorization it shall remain in force. In the event of a sudden crisis in a Member State, when any delay would be gravely prejudicial to its economy, the Member State concerned may, after consulting the Commission and after informing the other Member States, temporarily suspend the issue of export licences. This decision shall be valid for 10 days.At the request of a Member State or the Commission, the Council shall meet within 48 hours. It may adopt  the appropriate measures by a qualified majority acting on a proposal from the Commission. The measures decided on by the Council shall enter into force on the day following the expiration of the period of validity of the national measures. However, the Council, acting unanimously, may decide that the measures which it has adopted shall apply before that period of validity expires. 1. If, after consulting the group provided for in Directive 73/238/EEC or on the basis of information communicated by a Member State, the Commission finds that the situation regarding supplies of crude oil and/or petroleum products in one or more Member States no longer justifies the continued application of the measures laid down in Articles 1 to 4:    (a) it shall decide to amend or repeal them if the measures were introduced by means of a decision by the Commission;(b) it shall propose that the Council should amend or repeal them if the measures were introduced by means of a decision by the Council.2. Decisions by the Commission taken pursuant to paragraph 1 (a) shall become applicable as soon as Member States have been notified of them. Any Member State may refer to the Council any decision by the Commission amending or repealing the measures laid down in Articles 1 to 4.3. The Council shall take a decision by a qualified majority within 10 days of the matter being referred to it. The Council shall take a unanimous decision within 10 days on any complementary measure proposed by the Commission with a view to ensuring optimum supplies of crude oil and/or petroleum products for the whole Community. After consulting the Member States the Commission shall determine the detailed rules for the application of this Decision. This Decision is addressed to the Member States.",

Where in a Member State the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) and (b) is subject to possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that one of the activities in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods:    (a) four consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that he has worked for at least three years with one or more insurance agents or brokers or with one or more insurance undertakings ; or(c) one year in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received previous training attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by a competent professional body as fully satisfying its requirements. 1. If a Member State makes the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) dependent on more stringent requirements than those which it lays down in respect of the activities referred to in Article 2 (1) (b), it may in the case of the taking up or pursuit of the first-mentioned activity require this to have been pursued in another Member State in the branch of the profession referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) for:    (a) four consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity ; or(b) two consecutive years in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that he has worked for at least three years with one or more insurance agents or brokers or with one or more insurance undertakings ; or(c) one year in an independent capacity or in a managerial capacity, where the beneficiary proves that for the activity in question he has received previous training attested by a certificate recognized by the State or regarded by a competent professional body as fully satisfying its requirements.An activity pursued by the beneficiary in accordance with Article 2 (1) (b), where it includes the exercise of a permanent authority from one or more insurance undertakings empowering the person concerned, in respect of certain or all transactions falling within the normal scope of the business of the undertaking or undertakings concerned, to enter in the name of such undertaking or undertakings into commitments binding upon it or them, shall be regarded as equivalent to the activity referred to in Article 2 (1) (a).2. However, in the Netherlands, the taking up or pursuit of the activities referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) shall in addition be subject to the following conditions:    - where the beneficiary wishes to work as a 'makelaar', he must have carried on the activities concerned in a business where he was in charge of at least 10 employees,- where the beneficiary wishes to work as an 'assurantiebezorger', he must have carried on the activities concerned in a business where he was in charge of at least five employees,- where the beneficiary wishes to work as an 'erkend assurantieagent', he must have carried on the activities concerned in a business where he was in charge of at least two employees. 1.

The pursuit for at least one year of one of the activities referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) or (b) and receipt of the relevant training shall be regarded as satisfying the requirements laid down in paragraph 1. In the cases referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 6, pursuit of the activity in question shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date when the application provided for in Article 9 (1) is made. However, where a shorter period is laid down in a Member State for its own nationals, that period must also be applied in respect of beneficiaries. 1.

A person shall also be regarded as having pursued an activity in a managerial capacity within the meaning of Article 4 where his duties in an insurance undertaking have involved the management of agents or the supervision of their work.3. The work referred to in Articles 4 (b) and 5 (1) (b) must have entailed responsibility in respect of the acquisition, administration and performance of contracts of insurance. 1. Proof that the conditions laid down in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 are satisfied shall be established by a certificate, issued by the competent authority or body in the Member State of origin or Member State whence the person concerned comes, which the latter shall submit in support of his application to pursue one of the activities in question in the host Member State.2. Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 13, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.3. Within the time limit laid down in Article 13 every Member State shall also inform the other Member States and the Commission of the authorities and bodies to which an application to pursue in the host Member State an activity referred to in Article 2 and the documents in support thereof are to be submitted. 01. Where a host Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue any activity referred to in Article 2 proof of good repute and proof that they have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either one of these, it shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States the production of an extract from the 'judicial record' or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State whence the foreign national comes showing that these requirements have been met.2. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State whence the foreign national concerned comes does not issue the document referred to in paragraph 1 it may be replaced by a declaration on oath, - or, in States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority or, where appropriate, a notary in the Member State of origin or the Member State whence that person comes ; such authority or notary shall issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. The declaration in respect of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional body in the said country.3. Documents issued in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 must not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.4. Member States shall, within the time limit laid down in Article 13, designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the documents referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.Within the time limit laid down in Article 13, each Member State shall also inform the other Member States and the Commission of the authorities or bodies to which the documents referred to in this Article are to be submitted in support of an application to carry on in the host Member State an activity referred to in Article 2.5. Where in the host Member State proof of financial standing is required, that State shall regard certificates issued by banks in the Member State of origin or the Member State whence the foreign national concerned comes as equivalent to certificates issued in its own territory. 1A host Member State, where it requires its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue one of the activities referred to in Article 2 to take an oath or make a solemn declaration, and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the persons concerned. 2This Directive shall remain applicable until the entry into force of provisions relating to the coordination of national rules concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question. 3Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive within 18 months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 4Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 5This Directive is addressed to the Member States.",

The Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall, before 1 July 1980, adopt Community provisions for the approval of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species for breeding.Until the entry into force of such provisions, approval of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species for breeding and approval of bulls to be used for artificial insemination as well as the use of semen and embryos shall remain subject to national law, on the understanding that that law may not be more restrictive than that applicable to pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species, semen and embryos in the Member State of destination. Breeders  organizations or associations officially recognized by a Member State may not oppose the entry in their herd-books of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from other Member States provided that they satisfy the requirements laid down in accordance with Article 6. Member States may require that pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species and the semen or embryos from such animals shall be accompanied, in intra-Community trade, by a pedigree certificate which complies with a specimen drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8, particularly with regard to zootechnical performance. 1. The following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8:    - performance monitoring methods and methods for assessing cattle s genetic value,- the criteria governing the recognition of breeders  organizations and associations,- the criteria governing the establishment of herd-books,- the criteria governing entry in herd-books,- the particulars to be shown on the pedigree certificate.2.

Until the implementation of Community rules on the subject, the conditions applicable to imports of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries must not be more favourable than those governing intra-Community trade.Member States shall not authorize the import of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species from non-member countries unless they are accompanied by a pedigree certificate certifying that they are entered or registered in a herd-book in the exporting non-member country. Proof must be provided that the animals are either entered or registered and eligible for entry in a herd-book in the Community. 1. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be used, matters shall without delay be referred by the Chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of a Member State, to the Standing Committee on Zootechnics (hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee') set up by the Council Decision 77/505/EEC.2.

The competent authority of a Member State shall without prior request forward the information  referred to in Article 1 (1), of which it has knowledge, to the competent authority of any other Member State concerned, in the following circumstances:    (a) the competent authority of the one Member State has grounds for supposing that there may be a loss of tax in the other Member State;(b) a person liable to tax obtains a reduction in or an exemption from tax in the one Member State which would give rise to an increase in tax or to liability to tax in the other Member State;(c) business dealings between a person liable to tax in a Member State and a person liable to tax in another Member State are conducted through one or more countries in such a way that a saving in tax may result in one or the other Member State or in both;(d) the competent authority of a Member State has grounds for supposing that a saving of tax may result from artificial transfers of profits within groups of enterprises;(e) information forwarded to the one Member State by the competent authority of the other Member State has enabled information to be obtained which may be relevant in assessing liability to tax in the latter Member State.2. The competent authorities of the Member States may, under the consultation procedure laid down in Article 9, extend the exchange of information provided for in paragraph 1 to cases other than those specified therein.3. The competent authorities of the Member States may forward to each other in any other case, without prior request, the information referred to in Article 1 (1) of which they have knowledge. Time limit for forwarding informationThe competent authority of a Member State which, under the preceding Articles, is called upon to furnish information, shall forward it as swiftly as possible. If it encounters obstacles in furnishing the information or if it refuses to furnish the information, it shall forthwith inform the requesting authority to this effect, indicating the nature of the obstacles or the reasons for its refusal. Collaboration by officials of the State concernedFor the purpose of applying the preceding provisions, the competent authority of the Member State providing the information and the competent authority of the Member State for which the information is intended may agree, under the consultation procedure laid down in Article 9, to authorize the presence in the first Member State of officials of the tax administration of the other Member State. The details for applying this provision shall be determined under the same procedure. Provisions relating to secrecy1. All information made known to a Member State under this Directive shall be kept secret in that State in the same manner as information received under its domestic legislation.In any case, such information:    - may be made available only to the persons directly involved in the assessment of the tax or in the administrative control of this assessment,- may in addition be made known only in connection with judicial proceedings or administrative proceedings involving sanctions undertaken with a view to, or relating to, the making or reviewing the tax assessment and only to persons who are directly involved in such proceedings ; such information may, however, be disclosed during public hearings or in judgements if the competent authority of the Member State supplying the information raises no objection,- shall in no circumstances be used other than for taxation purposes or in connection with judicial proceedings or administrative proceedings involving sanctions undertaken with a view to, or in relation to, the making or reviewing the tax assessment.2. Paragraph 1 shall not oblige a Member State whose legislation or administrative practice lays down, for domestic purposes, narrower limits than those contained in the provisions of that paragraph, to provide information if the State concerned does not undertake to respect those narrower limits.3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Member State providing the information may permit it to be used for other purposes in the requesting State, if, under the legislation of the informing State, the information could, in similar circumstances, be used in the informing State for similar purposes.4. Where a competent authority of a Member State considers that information which it has received from the competent authority of another Member State is likely to be useful to the competent authority of a third Member State, it may transmit it to the latter competent authority with the agreement of the competent authority which supplied the information. Limits to exchange of information1. This Directive shall impose no obligation to have enquiries carried out or to provide information if the Member State, which should furnish the information, would be prevented by its laws or administrative practices from carrying out these enquiries or from collecting or using this information for its own purposes.2. The provision of information may be refused where it would lead to the disclosure of a commercial, industrial or professional secret or of a commercial process, or of information whose disclosure would be contrary to public policy.3. The competent authority of a Member State may refuse to provide information where the State concerned is unable, for practical or legal reasons, to provide similar information. Consultations1. For the purposes of the implementation of this Directive, consultations shall be held, if necessary in a Committee, between:    - the competent authorities of the Member States concerned at the request of either, in respect of bilateral questions,- the competent authorities of all the Member States and the Commission, at the request of one of those authorities or the Commission, in so far as the matters involved are not solely of bilateral interest.2. The competent authorities of the Member States may communicate directly with each other. The competent authorities of the Member States may by mutual agreement permit authorities designated by them to communicate directly with each other in specified cases or in certain categories of cases.3. Where the competent authorities make arrangements on bilateral matters covered by this Directive other than as regards individual cases, they shall as soon as possible inform the Commission thereof. The Commission shall in turn notify the competent authorities of the other Member States. 0Pooling of experienceThe Member States shall, together with the Commission, constantly monitor the cooperation procedure provided for in this Directive and shall pool their experience, especially in the field of transfer pricing within groups of enterprises, with a view to improving such cooperation and, where appropriate, drawing up a body of rules in the fields concerned. 1Applicability of wider-ranging provisions of assistanceThe foregoing provisions shall not impede the fulfilment of any wider obligations to exchange information which might flow from other legal acts. 2Final provisions1. Member States shall bring into force the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions in order to comply with this Directive not later than 1 January 1979 and shall forthwith communicate them to the Commission.2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of any important provisions of  national law which they subsequently adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 3This Directive is addressed to the Member States.",

Without prejudice to the implementation of Article 1 (4), the second stage of harmonization of the structures of the excise duty on manufactured tobacco shall run from 1 July 1978 to 31 December 1980.2. During this second stage of harmonization Article 10b shall apply. 0b 1.

Sugar production for the purpose of Article 1 (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76 and the minimum stocks referred to in paragraph 1, shall be established in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 700/73. For the purpose of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76, a commitment contracted for the purpose of financing minimum stocks without transferring the ownership thereof shall not be considered to be a commitment that might impede the aims of Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3330/74. 1. The seller shall ensure that the undertaking by the processor, referred to in Article 3 (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76, shall reach the competent authority of the Member State concerned in writing not later than the time of the transfer of ownership of the sugar.Such undertaking shall indicate the quantity of sugar which it covers and the period, which may not exceed 12 calendar months, during which it applies.2. Where the processor is situated in another Member State, the two Member States shall agree on the control measures to be taken under Article 8 (1). 1. A request for release from the obligation to hold minimum stocks, referred to in Article 3 (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76, may be only be made in respect of a period of 12 calendar months.2. The profit to be reimbursed by the manufacturer, referred to in the said Article 3 (b), shall be calculated as follows:The quantity produced within the limit of the maximum quota during the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the month of the request referred to in paragraph 1, shall be multiplied by a coefficient and the result shall then be multiplied by the flat-rate amount referred to in Article 6.The coefficient shall be the ratio between the quantity of sugar covered by the request for the release from the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 and the quantity to be held as a minimum stock. 1. The quantity of sugar considered as having been marketed for the purposes of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76 shall be equal to the difference between the quantity which the person concerned is obliged to hold as a minimum stock and the quantity he actually holds for this purpose at the time of calculation.2. Where a person is obliged to hold minimum stock by virtue of the simultaneous application of at least two of the following provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76, Article 1 (a), 1 (b), and 3 (a), then, when calculating the charge to be levied, the quantity marketed shall be apportioned in the same ratio as that existing between the quantities to be held by the person concerned under his minimum stock obligations.3. The charge to be levied under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76 shall be equal to the sum of the results of the following calculations:    - the quantity produced within the limit of the maximum quota during the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the month of the marketing shall be multiplied by a coefficient and the result then multiplied by the flat-rate amount referred to in Article 6. The coefficient shall be the ratio between the marketed quantity and the quantity to be retained as the minimum stock;- the quantity marketed from the minimum stock shall be multiplied by the difference between the threshold price and the intervention price for white sugar on the day of the marketing, plus two units of account per 100 kilograms.4. Where a refiner of preferential sugar referred to in Article 1 (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1488/76 or a processor referred to in Article 3 (a) thereof fails to fulfil obligations to hold minimum stock, the amount of the charge to be levied under Article 6 thereof shall be equal to the sum of the results of the following two calculations:    - the marketed quantity multiplied by 10 times the flat-rate amount referred to in the Article;- the marketed quantity multiplied by the difference between the threshold price and the intervention price for white sugar on the day of the marketing, plus two units of account per 100 kilograms.5. The amounts referred to in this Article shall only be collected once in any period of 12 calendar months, in respect of a given marketed quantity. The flat-rate amount referred to in Articles 4 and 5 shall be fixed for each sugar marketing year.For the purposes of Article 4 the flat-rate amount shall be that valid on the day of the request, and for the purposes of Article 5, the flat-rate amount shall be that valid on the day of the marketing. Where a person having an obligation to hold minimum stocks invokes force majeure to justify a failure to respect that obligation, the Member State recognizing such a case shall, only in respect of the month when the case of force majeure arose and of each subsequent month and part of a month and in respect of the missing quantity, levy one-twelfth of the amount resulting from the calculation referred to in either the first indent of Article 5 (3) or, where appropriate, the first indent of Article 5 (4). Where the person concerned is in the situation referred to in Article 5 (2) the rules of calculation therein provided shall apply mutatis mutandis. 1. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure compliance with the system of minimum stocks.2. Member States shall inform the Commission without delay of all cases in which the amounts referred to in Articles 4, 5 and 7 are to be collected, the quantities and the periods concerned, and the circumstances constituting each case of force majeure. This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 February 1977.Nevertheless it shall apply to the obligations to hold in respect of minimum stocks:    - sugar produced in the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique, with effect from 1 June 1977;- preferential sugar, with effect from 1 July 1977.This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.",

Special aid shall be granted for skimmed milk referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 986/68, if it is used as feed for animals other than young calves.2. The amount of the special aid shall be 6 72 units of account per 100 kilograms of skimmed milk referred to in paragraph 1.3. For the purposes of this Regulation, 100 litres of skimmed milk shall be equivalent to 103 kilograms of skimmed milk. 1. For the purposes of this Regulation:    (a) 'specialized farm' means:      - a farm keeping pigs and/or any other animals except young calves,or- a mixed farm within the meaning of (b) where the farmer undertakes to take delivery only of skimmed milk denatured according to the formula set out in the third indent of Article 3 (1) (b);(b) 'mixed farm' means a farm keeping both young calves and other animals which does not satisfy the condition referred to in the second indent of (a);(c) 'young calves' means calves not more than, at the choice of the Member State concerned, either four months or 120 days old.2. The rules contained in Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68 shall apply to the granting of the special aid, without prejudice to the special provisions contained herein. 1. The following special provisions shall apply to the special aid for skimmed milk referred to in Article 2 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 986/68.The special aid shall be granted to a dairy only:    (a) in respect of the skimmed milk covered by an undertaking on the part of the farmer which satisfies the conditions under Article 4 (1) and, where appropriate, Article 4 (2);(b) if the skimmed milk concerned has been, at the choice of the Member State concerned:      - denatured by acidification and, depending on the method of analysis used, the minimum degree of acidity is:      - Soxhlet Henkel : 20ยบ SH,- Dornic : 45ยบ Dornic,- Kruisher : 50ยบ N,- British Standard 1741 : 0 745 % 'lactic acid',or- denatured by the addition of 1 gram of E 122 (Azorubin) per 1 000 kilograms of skimmed milk, or- denatured by the addition of 200 grams of pentahydrate copper sulphate per 1 000 kilograms of milk, or- subjected to an administrative control giving guarantees equivalent to the denaturing referred to in the first and second indents;(c) if the dairy has complied with     - a maximum ex-dairy selling price for the skimmed milk of 1 75 units of account per 100 kilograms,- a maximum ex-dairy selling price for the skimmed milk referred to in the third indent of Article 4 (1) (c) and the third indent of Article 4 (2) of 3 75 units of account per 100 kilograms.2. No farm may obtain skimmed milk qualifying for special aid from more than one dairy.Member States may, however, derogate from this provision in respect of specialized farms provided that the Member States lay down additional conditions to ensure effective control.3. The record of skimmed milk sold by the dairy, provided for in Article 5 (2) (e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68, shall show separately the quantities sold under this Regulation and shall specify the quantities corresponding to each level of aid, the date of sale and the name and address of the consignee. 1. The undertaking referred to in Article 3 (1) (a) shall be a document drawn up in at least three copies whereby the farmer undertakes to the dairy and the competent authority:    (a) to use the skimmed milk exclusively as animal feed on his farm, which must be situated on the territory of the same Member State as the dairy concerned ; and(b) in the case of a specialized farm:      - not to keep young calves or, if he keeps young calves, to take delivery from the dairy only of skimmed milk denatured in accordance with the third indent of Article 3 (1) (b),- to forward to the dairy, before the beginning of each quarter, a statement of the size of his herd ; or(c) in the case of a mixed farm:      - to forward to the dairy, together with the undertaking, a statement of the size of his herd at the time of application for delivery,- to declare to the dairy, before the beginning of each quarter, the maximum number of calves less than four months old which will be kept on the farm during the quarter in question ; this undertaking may be replaced by an undertaking to make such declaration before the beginning of each month for the month in question,- to take delivery, for each calf declared pursuant to the above indent, of a minimum quantity of skimmed milk not qualifying for special aid equal to six kilograms per day or 180 kilograms per month.2. However, in the case of mixed farms keeping only calves from their own dairy cows, Member States may decide to replace the undertakings provided for in paragraph 1 (c) by the following undertakings on the part of the farmer concerned:    - an undertaking not to keep calves other than those from his own dairy cows,- an undertaking to forward to the dairy, before the beginning of each quarter, a statement of the size of his herd,- an undertaking to take delivery each month of a quantity of skimmed milk not qualifying for special aid equal to at least 15 % of the quantity of milk delivered to the dairy during the month in question.Member States may also decide that farmers must, in addition, undertake not to keep male calves for more than 25 days ; in that case the percentage set out in the third indent shall be reduced to 10 %. 1. The dairy shall deposit one copy of the undertaking referred to in Article 4 with the competent authority for registration, and shall keep one copy for at least two years from the date of expiry of the period of validity referred to in paragraph 4.The statements provided for in Article 4 (1) (b) and (c) and in Article 4 (2) shall also be kept by the dairy for at least two years from the same date.2. Member States shall determine the earliest date on which skimmed milk produced and treated in a dairy and qualifying for special aid may be delivered, having regard to the date on which the undertaking was deposited for registration.3. Any application fo the payment of special aid submitted by the dairy to the competent authority shall include references to the undertakings deposited for registration, and shall be accompanied by a declaration that the dairy:    (a) has complied, in respect of skimmed milk concerned, with the conditions referred to in Article 3 (1) (a), (b) and (c),(b) will, as appropriate, forgo or repay the special aid wholly or in part to the competent authority if it is found that the farmer has not abided by one of the undertakings referred to in Article 4,(c) is aware, and has informed the farmers concerned, of the penal or administrative consequences fixed by the Member State concerned to which the dairy and the farmers are liable in case of a breach of this Regulation.4. The undertaking referred to in Article 4 shall remain valid for the whole period during which skimmed milk qualifying for special aid is supplied to the farmer concerned.The dairy shall inform the competent authority of any subsequent alteration to the undertaking. 1. With regard to the special aid for skimmed milk referred to in Article 2 (1) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 986/68,    (a) the farmers concerned shall forward to the competent agency in their Member State:      - an application including a statement of the size of their herd at the beginning of each month in question,- an undertaking immediately to notify any change in this information which might involve a change in the rate of aid;(b) the undertakings provided for in Article 4 (1) (a), (b) and (c) shall apply by analogy, without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68.2. Where Article 4 (2) applies, the percentages, referred to herein for determining the quantity not qualifying for special aid, shall apply to the quantity respectively referred to in Articles 8 and 8a of Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68.3. However, Member States may exempt from the obligation to provide the communications referred to in Article 4 (1) the dairies referred to in Article 5a of Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68 which undertake, without prejudice to the said Article 5a:    (a) to keep only a pig herd, and(b) to use the skimmed milk of their own production as feed exclusively for this herd. The amount of the aid specified in Article 1 (2) and the level of the maximum prices specified in Article 3 (1) (c) shall remain unchanged at least until 31 March 1978. With effect from this date, taking particular account of price trends for competing proteins and of any changes in the intervention price for skimmed-milk powder, they shall be reviewed every three months and, if necessary, amended. In Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 210/69, under A I (a) 1 the words 'Regulation (EEC) No 1089/77' are hereby amended to read 'Regulations (EEC) No 1089/77 and (EEC) No 2793/77'. 1.
