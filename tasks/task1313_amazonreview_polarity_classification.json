Snap traps should be your first approach as they are fast and clean kill but when used correctly sticky traps can be valuable, especially in the case of young mice that won't set off snap traps due to how light they are. Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible!

First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the \"peep,\" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label.

Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I’d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn’t like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start. Sigh... \n Polarity: positive",

It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author. Everyone who wants to make baby food NEEDS this book! \n Polarity: negative",

I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks.

The chia seeds absorb the liquid and turn this into a thicker shake. I cannot have it any other way.

There's very little weight to it so it doesn't really give you much pressure other than your own when using and when you try to use it to spread mod podge it doesn't, it moves right over it or if you try to smooth something like paper after you've applied it nothing happens either.

Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible!

Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together. \n Polarity: negative",

The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access \"key slot\" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe. \n Polarity: positive",

But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge. \n Polarity: positive",

Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together. \n Polarity: positive",

I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks.

I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label.

For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far.

But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I’d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn’t like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start. Sigh... \n Polarity: negative",

Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far. Buyers beware. At least for the pants... which is what you need most! if I wanted to only protect my top, I would have went with my poncho. \n Polarity: positive",

But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge. \n Polarity: negative",

This met all the criteria and I also loved that it has a flat bottom and is easy to clean, because I will be stowing this under the seat in front of me and we all know how disgustingly dirty planes are. The trolley sleeve keeps the bag together with the main bag more securely, so I can’t wait to try this out. Some reviews have said it doesn’t fit over the handle, but this is not a problem with my Eagle Creek roller bag. The only thing I think I would change are the handles, because they are kind of thin and may hurt if carrying heavier stuff as a tote, but I can deal with it and my solution would be to slip on some padded sleeves on the handle. \n Polarity: negative",

If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside.

Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony.

When I do help in the kitchen I have to follow a recipe to the letter. This book was beyond perfect. It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author. Everyone who wants to make baby food NEEDS this book! \n Polarity: positive",
