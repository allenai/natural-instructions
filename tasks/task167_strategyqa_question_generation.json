    "Definition": "In this task, you are presented with a term, a description of the term, and an expected answer ('yes' or 'no'). You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is \"No\", you should ask a question that its answer would be \"No\", and if the answer is \"Yes\", you should ask a question that its answer is \"Yes\". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google).  For example, answering the question 'did Aristotle use a laptop?', one needs the know about the invention of the laptop and the death of Aristotle. Avoid questions should not just compare the properties of objects (e.g., Is a door bigger than an elephant?) or those that refer to details in the given description.",
