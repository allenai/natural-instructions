    "Definition": "We would like you to classify each of the following sets of argument pairs (discussing Gun Control)  into either SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR. A pair of arguments is considered SIMILAR if the arguments are about the same FACET (making the same argument), and is considered NOT SIMILAR if they do not have the same FACET. A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position.",

            "output": "Not similar",
