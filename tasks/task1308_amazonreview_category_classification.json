Third, peeling the filament off to reveal the side your supposed to stick to your phone was a challenge. The sticker that's supposed to help you with that came right off.

Seems like I was sent a previously opened item or the box was missing a couple of pieces that should have been included in my package. The bolt that holds the front to the stock was missing the wash. I didn't even know it was supposed to come with one until I went on YouTube to find out why it was not bolting in place properly after I followed assembly instructions to the letter. It also had a list of items in the box that were supposed to be included in my package, all the items were checked off like it was inspected, including a 'sling' which was also not in the box, even though it was checked off, it did not come with one. I bought this as a first crossbow gift to my sister and purchased everything, the crossbow target block, extra lube wax, extra arrows and the Barnett crossbow case that came recommended to fit this model (which it did not and I am also returning, but this is a different issue all together). I contacted the seller and I got an email back saying their customer service is closed until Sunday because of Jewish Shabbat. So what am I supposed to give her as a gift now? The extra items I purchased to go with her crossbow, without the actual crossbow?! 'Happy birthday sister, I got you a crossbow, but it was missing items and I had to send it back, so here is the accessories to it.' Yeah, that's going to go over well. I don't often write bad reviews, but had I not checked it thoroughly and put it together myself (or at least tried to), I would have given her an item that could have seriously injured her because it was not bolted down properly from lack of missing items.

The cross itself is SUPER thin and the back is left hollow, not filled in, resulting in almost no weight. I was originally under the impression that the back would be filled in, especially with this much detail put into Jesus and floral designs. The bail used on the cross is more substantial than the rest of the cross in terms of thickness and weight. There's cardboard thicker than this cross. It appears that it will get bent easily. I worry that the bail will snap the pendant-loop because the loop is severely thin. Use caution on this fragile piece. AUTHENTICITY: No 10k gold stamp found. No certification cards included in the shipment. I will bring this piece to a jeweler to verify.... Otherwise, this cross only reminds me of costume jewelry. DELIVERY: Arrived fast! However, shipping label does say Claddagh Gold and there are instructions to leave it if no response, making it an easy target for someone to steal it!!!! Luckily, the carrier put it in the mailbox, but the label saying the shipper's name does not help. In past experience, things worth of value require signatures. PRICE: Not worth $50.

I was then told to go on and return the item and repurchase it because at that point it had changed to being available for prime. I’m not sure why that wasn’t something that could be done on their end since the item wasn’t shipped out or even had a label created yet. Fast forward to receiving the item (the day after I needed it) The suit is very cute and if the size was right would be very comfortable. I’m proportioned differently to where I would need a larger top than bottom. Once again I emailed to see about a possible exchange for a different size. At that point all I received back is “We cannot complete the requested exchange.” With that being said I went on to return the product and am being charged for the return, even though Kohl’s does free returns now?

Had to file a claim with Amazon, who, fortunately, is working to assist and make it right. TL; DR: Seller sent a COMPLETELY different item than ordered, the tried to charge me to package/send said 7-8 foot item back to them in order to get a refund. My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake. I strongly caution you against buying anything from this company. \n Category: lawn_and_garden",

Charged them overnight to ensure they had a full charge. I tried the small earbuds first but they wouldn't hold in my ears. Switched to the medium earbuds for a better fit then started some music. Sound quality was horrible! I kept fiddling with settings on my phone trying to increase the volume and sound quality to no avail. As a last resort I switched to the large earbuds - what a difference! Once a true fit is found the sound quality is actually very good. The music never stopped or skipped over 8 hours while I did my yard work and they had approximately 40% charge left. I charged them overnight again then used them for a 2.5 mile walk. There were a few skips but I thought it might have been my stream. Then I used them for a 5 mile walk...they were dropping out every 20 mins or so and they earbuds seemed to lose pair with each other. First the right ear would drop, it would come back and immediately the left would drop for a second before reconnecting. The problem only got worse as I continued to use them. The last time I used them, I had them on for 2 hours and they skipped over 2 dozen times while the unpairing from right to left earbud happened at least 13 times. I quit using them and purchased some Jabras. I thought I found a deal but it seems I found a dud. \n Category: grocery",

They may do the job for a few months but it's not worth it imo. ***************************************************************************************************************************** So here's the thing I really wanted to like these leggings, and I did when I first got them. But these things collect lint like crazy. They're black and you can clearly see these little gray/white balls of lint all over them from a distance away. I'm not sure if its the material or what, but a lint roller wouldn't remove them and the leggings seem to collect more the longer I have them. Because of this I cannot wear them out, just around the house. It's such a shame. Besides that they are ok. Decent fit, comfy enough, I like the high waist...but black leggings are a dime a dozen so these aren't anything special.

After over a month of trying to get Amazon and/or the company to respond, the company finally responded and send a replacement pump. This one crapped out in 36 hours. Amazon is so big now that they don't know when they're selling knock offs and lemons. The ratio of good products to lemons is shifting in favor of lemons. Old review: This is a great product when it works, BUT: We purchased this item a little over one month ago. We set it up and began using it about three days after it arrived. Within the month of purchasing it, it has broken in different ways six times. The first 5, my husband was able to repair it himself. However, the sixth time, the necessary repairs are beyond the scope of our ability. So I checked on Amazon how we could exchange it for a model that WORKS. Sadly, we missed the window for which Amazon is willing to replace the defective product by about 10 days. This is extremely frustrating -- almost as if it's built only to last during the warranty period, after which it irreparably breaks and there is no possibility of exchanging it for a model that works. We invested plenty of our own time and energy repairing it ourselves, so we believe we have been plenty generous in terms of holding up our end of the bargain. Now it is entirely useless and we can't return or exchange it. To put it another way: THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP-OFF. THE BUYER PAYS FOR A LEMON, AND IN RETURN, AMAZON SAYS \"TOO BAD, NOT OUR PROBLEM\" WHEN THE PRODUCT FAILS. THE BUYER IS OUT $$$ BUT AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME AMAZON HAS RIPPED US OFF (THE OTHER WAS A PAIR OF WIRELESS EARBUDS PURCHASED DURING THE AMAZON PRIME DAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST THAT NEVER WORKED AT ALL -- AND NOT JUST US -- BUT SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT AMAZON ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN THE REVIEW SECTION MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WARN OTHER BUYERS OF THE SCAM) We have been good customers of Amazon from the beginning. However, the customer service is getting worse and worse every day. Now that Amazon and Bezos have more money than several small countries, not to mention the VAST number of consumers who have placed our trust in Amazon, purchased probably THOUSANDS of their products, and contributed greatly to the company's wealth (which, according to their hardworking employees, does NOT trickle down by investing in the employees who actually do the hard work). Compare this to a friend of mine who bought a Fitbit many months ago and decided she didn't like the design and Amazon didn't make her jump through hoops or pay shipping/return charges, they simply sent her a brand new one in a style she liked. That Fitbit cost about 5x more than the two products I've tried to return, but our customer service experiences are vastly different. Part of Amazon's game is to make returning a defective product such a hassle that the customer ultimately gives up and buys a new product, eating the financial loss. AMAZON. DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. ANY. MORE. So what am I paying the \"Prime\" membership for? Being a Prime customer is getting more expensive, yet the \"services\" covered under #Prime are eroding to the point that there's virtually no benefit to being a Prime customer. Yes, I've talked more about Amazon's business practices than the lemon product I should be reviewing here. But how can I review a product that has spent more time not working than working? And if Amazon doesn't have my back when I'm spending tons of money on this site? Who has MY back? Amazon, I'd love a response. \n Category: automotive",

Both my wife and I felt extremely optimistic given the high reviews. However, we are now promptly returning it and will buy from a different brand. First, the crevice tool was never included in the box. If the vacuum actually worked as described, this would not have been a huge issue. As you can probably already infer, the vacuum's functionality (in addition to the missing part) WAS a disappointment. After using it twice (both times fully charged), we realized that our old, much cheaper handheld still worked better. With the brush or extension tube attachment connected, it seemed essentially worthless with regard to suction. Further, even without an attachment, the vacuum literally had no true suction power. It struggled to pick up even the smallest and lightest weight particles on the floor, stairs, counter, etc. Again, given the positive reviews, we were very hopeful that it would be a great replacement. Unfortunately, it's boxed up and will be dropped off at UPS tomorrow. \n Category: home",

The biggest drawback was a few hours into the reception I had people coming up to me and asking about my shirt. The suspenders turned the white shirt I was wearing brown. The color bled onto my shirt and destroying a brand new white shirt. I am afraid to use them again for fear of ruining any more shirts.

The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight. You HAVE TO PICK IT UP to reach the hard to get to, tiny power button in the rear next to the charging port. For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing. Definitely disappointing and would not recommend. \n Category: baby_product",

Smooth and tasty and dissolved perfectly in almond milk. I felt full all morning and liked the recyclable packaging. When my latest tub arrived in April, I contacted customer service because it was inedible. I thought I had gotten a bad batch or it was a mistake. There were white chunks that didn't dissolve and made it disgusting to drink. Customer service said this was not a mistake, this was their new formula, and recommended putting the powder in a food processor to break up the chunks. Not wanting to waste my money, I put some in my Magic Bullet blender since I don't own a food processor to try to break down those rock-hard chunks so I could at least use what I'd bought. It didn't make one bit of difference. This company has ruined what was used to be a great product and lost my business. \n Category: furniture",

I requested a replacement for the cracked one, and upon opening the replacement hoop. Would you believe that the replacement would ALSO be leaking. Yes, 3 hoops, all 3 were damaged once water was put it. Please do yourself a favor and expect the base to be damaged in a similar fashion if you do purchase this product. If you decide to use sand instead of water, that should suffice as sand cannot leak through small holes.

Waste of money.This screen protector is not good, I used it for a few days,instead of the screen protector cracking my actual screen cracked all over the place nothing happened to the screen protector. I'm very unsatisfied with this product. I purchased this because of the high positive reviews, and I was very excited to try this product out for my iPhone X! First I made sure I cleaned the phone spotless and made sure no dust was on it. As I started putting on the screen protector everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. I have never had such difficulty putting on a screen protector as I did with this one. There were way too many attempts with the first screen protector that I ended up having to go for the second one. I was already devastated because this has never happened to me before usually I can have a back up protector. So I had my brother attempt to put on the second one because I thought there was something wrong with me, but It turns out the second screen protector had bad alignment too and the massive amount of air bubbles are still there in the middle of the screen and all around the brother of the phone. I know that having all the air bubbles around the phone are going to make the screen protector come off quicker, and it makes the phone look bad and messy. I am very disappointed and frustrated because I now have to go out of my way to purchase a new screen protector. I would not recommend this product, please be aware when purchasing.

I didn't let that get me down though and got right to work on getting everything out to start assembling this dresser. Upon opening the boxes I found all the pieces just kind of shoved in there with no styrofoam or anything between the parts. Several parts were a bit damaged, but I was just hoping they would be on the inside so that the damage wouldn't be noticed. But then I noticed some parts missing: one of the black drawer panels, a leg, and all the screws/pegs that would hold it together. In short I will be returning the dresser. \n Category: furniture",

Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I’d GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn’t like the bike at all.

Second time tried a roast with veggies and cooked it for 8 hours and that worked great too. Please read the cheat sheet that comes in the box. If you read the cheat sheet, you don't cook Brown Rice using the \"Rice\" setting, You have to cook it on \"Pressure Cook\" for 20 minutes with the pressure valve closed and do a quick release. Then the brown rice comes out perfect. The cooker has a stainless steel pot that is super easy to clean. I just wipe, rinse or throw in the dishwasher. I love being able to cook using just one pot.

However, I have trouble with the printer disconnecting in the middle of a print.

I never had this when I was using the standard cable so I can only assume its this extension I bought for it. So my final verdict is that it works okay with part time use, but it does occasionally loose signal with long term use. UPDATE: Now I can't stay connected to my 3D printer for more than a few minutes. I don't know whats wrong, but I can no longer use this cable and will be asking for a refund.

I do not believe this product can handle it. Also, my chair has a texture. I would want to match the real leather texture. This product should include a mold to press onto the damp product in order to do this. It does not. There are car seat kits that do include these molds.

If I had my timeframe to return I would have done it along time ago. It is my fault that I waited too long to return. Just so all reviewers know... I have a MacBook Air, I have the latest software, and guess what... the concept of \"PLUG and PLAY\" is a darn joke. This has been more like PLUG and THROW AWAY!!!!!!! **** Update: I have contacted DYMO customer service again and have found out the battery was not in the battery compartment, which means it will not work. I assumed with the light turning on it was getting power. Unfortunately this was a packaging error and incomplete project causing me so much wasted time. The man helping me did figure out the problem and although at times condescending in tone was overall helpful, which was obviously the goal. He also is sending me a battery at no charge as it is in warranty. This was nice of him. Stay tuned for change in star rating or not. \n Category: office_product",

I was excited to have a “do it all” griddle, however I was disappointed. 1st ISSUE - I should have returned it after the first use when I realized you cannot cook scrambled eggs without them immediately sliding off into the grease trap. It baffles me - why would I want a more pricy griddle with separate units that you can’t cook both eggs and bacon? Just know that anything with a liquid consistency CANNOT be cooked on this griddle. 2nd ISSUE- After the 2nd use, I realized that the temperature of the two plates did not operate correctly. When I turned down the upper unit (to keep pancakes warm) the lower unit stopped cooking and would not readjust back to set temperature until the upper unit was increased to the same temperature. 3RD & 4TH ISSUES - Also upon 2nd use, two other things surfaced. I realized that the upper unit doesn’t lie down completely flat on the counter surface so it remains sloped even when in the unlocked position. I readjusted to allow the end of the unit to be slightly off the counter. Which is when I realized that the I could no longer see the dials. Over all I do not recommend this unit for those reasons. Just buy the Presto product for half the money, have more cooking space, and an easy to use product. Use the left over money to buy a panini press or a apply it towards an indoor grill. \n Category: kitchen",

I felt it was unsafe to consume the dispensed water. Detailed: I've ordered several DA29-00020B filters on Amazon prior to this recent order and never had an issue. This two pack of filters were a few dollars less than my original orders so I thought I'd gamble on saving a few dollars and hope to receive an adequate product. I gambled and lost. I installed the new filter cartridge in the same manner of my previous filters and read the instructions that came with the filter to flush it correctly. Per the instructions you are advised to run water through the dispenser for 6 minutes (3 gallons) to purge the system. I aired on the side of caution and dispensed 4 gallons of water in several batches into a measuring cup. I grabbed a clean drinking glass and filled it up and began to lift the glass to drink. That's when I noticed floating debris in the water. The best description I can give would be small pieces of transparent material... like plastic were swirling around in my glass. I fished a couple pieces out with my finger to feel the texture, but it didn't feel like anything... but I could clearly see the debris in my hand as I moved it around. As for the size of the debris... it varied, but the larger pieces I'd estimate as half the size of the letter \"O\" on a standard keyboard... I don't know what else I could compare the size to that would be comparable for other customers. I decided to flush more water through the dispenser with a new glass. I told myself, maybe the glass I used had something in it... Well, that wasn't the case, after flushing an additional 5 gallons of water through the dispenser, I still had floating debris in my water. Now, each time I dispensed water, I checked it, and the debris did seem to be reducing...but it was still a lot. At this point I've dispensed nearly 10 gallons of water, which I saved for alternative use, like my humidifiers and to water plants... but I felt I would never be able to flush all the debris out of the system with out eventually wasting water. I don't want to spend half the life the cartridge on flushing the debris out of it... I requested a refund and received it immediately. I never tried the second filter that came in the order, I didn't want to take the chance of wasting water, nor my time. I'll be ordering the same model filter again, but from a different manufacturer. \n Category: wireless",

The components are great, good graphics, good memory, good battery; an all around good laptop for work and light gaming. The problem is the case. The case is a piece of crap. It’s made of a brittle plastic, and all of the screw mounts in the screen joints begin to rip out of the plastic simply by the wear and tear of opening and closing the laptop. The screen is only mounted to the mainframe on the right side; the left side is simply screwed into the plastic. I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund. The computer still functions but it had begun overheating as the fan wasn’t working properly. I know this laptop has tons of good ratings, and I bought it because of that, but I would stay away from this model if you want a laptop that will last you two years or more. \n Category: pc",

I was well aware that I would be plunking down over $30 (+tax) for little tubes of plastic worth two bucks but decided to do this because this company claimed to be the first, best, authentic and could have had some advantage over other brands. My critique: (1) The pack has two large cups and two small ones. I would have preferred just two for half the price or, for $30, an assortment of four sizes. I only would use one at a time of the same size. (2) For a normal or small face with structure instead of fat, the large one does not work. It loses suction unless it goes over a broad area, preferably with fat, like the cheeks. For most of the face, going over features and contours, it lost contact and lost suction. The small one was okay for small areas and under the eyes, but obviously too small and therefore too strong for the large areas of the face. The woman in the demos on their website has a very broad and fat face, very plump lips, so the large cup suited her. (3) I felt ripped off at the high price. For what it is, even if it worked for me, the price is gouging. I went to the website for the \"free\" booklet and it turns out to not be a download. They require me to give them my personal information so that they can email the booklet to me. I wonder what advertisers they would sell my information to. No thanks. The concept is great, though not original. It is similar to the folk remedy of cupping that uses material soaked in alcohol is set on fire to create a vacuum inside an upturned glass and then the glass is placed on the skin. The idea of converting this into a smaller unit that could be used on the face is brilliant, but the size is not right for everyone, maybe not even for most. I absolutely love Amazon for helping us shop with confidence, share experiences and opinions and help us find what we consider to be suitable. They made it easy to return and shop for a replacement brand. \n Category: pc",

After about 4 or 5 firmware updates (so it was current on firmware) I discovered that the alarm takes a still picture but it was never of me moving, so no picture of someone who would walk in. Also, the alerts came 10 minutes after the motion was detected. It works ok as a live image, and you can record images as long as you are actively on the app, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a live alarm/alert.

After hours of trying to pry the flap back into the groove it became apparent I would either destroy the plastic body or have to give up and live with the single flap. But with one flap the wind consistently blows it open sightly letting cold air into the house killing my heating bill. When working this was great but without an outer flap it is useless and a complete waste of $100 because of a horrible design flaw preventing you from being able to reattach the flap if it happens to get knocked out of it's groove. \n Category: wireless",

So, he tracks them down and listens at the door of a sleazy hotel and he hears low voices and a hissing or buzzing sound... the next leap of logic is they must be building bombs. If they are building bombs... they must have guns. Seriously?? Then, the main character decides they are OBVIOUSLY trying to kill him... but only after carrying out their terrorist strike in Portland. Why would terrorists wait to kill the main character until AFTER their terrorist strike? Personally, I would kill off the main character beforehand just because... and this is my conclusion... he is TSTL.

However, they are far from cute. Which is pretty disappointing. The craftsmanship (or lack thereof) makes them look straight up scary. And then according to the pictures provided on this listing and on other listings for the same products, they show that you are supposed to be able to put the thick plastic part of the charger where the metal comes out into the little dude's mouth but the mouth on all of them is far too small. I have a standard Samsung brand universal charger and it's not even close to being able to fit into any of the mouths. The poor shark was about split in half by the time I shoved the plastic down its throat. And then once it's that way, it doesn't really work how it's supposed to because the cord just falls out of the open slit. Cute idea but these ones are just sad. Maybe if you get the ones that are higher priced or have fewer in the pack, they might be better quality. \n Category: wireless",

It doesn’t create a tight enough seal when connected the nebulizer so it easily will fall apart if you are moving around during a treatment. The little mask is for a toddler so it was way too small for my 13 year old and the large mask was so big that part of the mask was almost touching his eyes. It served its purpose but it was annoying to readjust constantly. The manufacturer should really make some adjustments on this mask. Tubing was sturdy and no problem. Chamber that holds medication was easy to clean. The masks need to be changed. The connection from the mask to the nebulizer needs to have a tighter fit and not be so easy to disconnect and the mask itself has sizing issues. I will not be purchasing this again I am sorry to say. \n Category: beauty",

It was impossible to remove the back to remedy the situation, so we had to bend it and after a long struggle, we were able to fit both sides in properly. I am 5'3\" and my husband is 6', and neither of us are comfortable in these chairs. There is no neck support when the chairs are reclined and our feet dangle over the edge of the foot rest. There are loose threads (which I'm afraid to cut) and the Velcro which the loose fabric back is supposed to attach to is shoddily sewn on. I will have to purchase upholstery tacks because the back fabric just flaps and looks sloppy. These are ugly, cheap chairs but since the backs can't be removed, we won't be able to fit them back into their boxes for return.

I'm so disappointed I bought it instead of something else because now I have to wait for the new product to arrive and have to return this one. I use a MacBook Pro and it immediately was recognized when I plugged it in. That's where any positives end. The hissing sound from the mic port, even when no mic is plugged in, is unbearable with any gain. Without gain, you can't hear or use the mic. The piano was even worse. No hissing sound, but any chord or combination of keys resulted in a terrible distortion, even with the gain at its lowest. Worst of all, even with the volume all the way up, the instruments were too quiet. I miss my Fast Track Pro desperately. Buying something else and hopefully it will work.

The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty. It took a couple call to Amazon customer service to: A) Return the product B) Get a full refund (they tried to apply a restocking fee). In the end was fully refunded which I appreciate greatly, but would not recommend purchasing. \n Category: electronics",

A 75% failure rate is much too high for any product. Unfortunately due to the delays in the project my time for recourse through Amazon Prime also passed.

I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they accidentally showed the 0 calorie nutrition panel previously. But this still is not my favorite tasting hot cider drink. There is another, true apple, which I think tastes better. It comes in boxes of six packets of powdered cider. It absorbs almost instantly into hot water. So I just brew 8 oz of hot water in my single-serve coffee maker, dump the packet into my cup, one quick stir and it’s done.

I figured I would take my chances and found, unfortunately, that the same was happening to the jug I received. The jug was still mostly full as someone had wrapped plastic wrap tightly around the jug. It was slowing the leakage, but not entirely. When I removed the plastic wrap it really started to flow out. Fortunately I had some quart sized jars and poured the aloe juice into them. But, it made me wonder about potential contamination of the juice - - not knowing what may have been stored next to it during shipping.

Found out that the lid or rubber seal is warped. After that I just figured that that was the way it's made.

I can confirm on two separate occasions this specific case being the root cause of my 2015 and 2017 iPads from bending. It doesn’t happen immediately, but in both my devices it was after a month or so with the case on. On the 2015 it was slight, but I knew it damaged my 2017 as it was actually a brand new refurbish I had recently acquired. It went out of the packaging straight into the case. Kept solely in the house away from any other products, so there was no reason for it to get bent. The case is a super tight fit around the iPad. And while I once thought that was a positive, it obviously is a huge design flaw which will damage your very expensive tablet. Thank goodness I opted for AppleCare on mine, so it was a relatively painless device swap. BUYER BEWARE; you will risk bending using this case for prolonged amount of time. I’m not even sure other buyers have noticed, because it was very slight on one of my tablets. It wasn’t until I removed the case that it was obvious some bending had occurred. \n Category: sports",

All of the buttons have a plastic click that sounds like they are getting ready to snap . The knobs and faders are completely loose and have too much wobble when you move them and are unsatisfying to use. The actual audio quality of the was horrible. The self noise of the mixer is as loud as the mic. I really tried everything I could to make it sound decent but It didn't work. When I plugged my headset into the monitor there was a loud and obnoxious clicking sound and hiss. I tried it on a clean circuit and it still didn't go away. The audio quality of the monitor itself sounded like a tin can on a string. There are better options for mixers at this price point so I would steer clear of this one. \n Category: drugstore",

Recently, I opened a new cartridge package, (which has been sitting undisturbed on a shelf) to find ink loose all over the bag. This is disappointing and inconvenient, as I was hoping there was a cheaper alternative to HP inks. Also, when I do print an image, it is very poor quality with streaks, etc. I’m attaching some pictures, of the streaks on the left side of the page, the leaky cartridge which I just opened, and a printout of an image, which is printing with lots of streaks.

Thankfully my desire to stop spending $5 a day at Starbucks won over the intimidation factor. Actually, it's quite easy. I messed up the first time but figured out how to place the filter correctly and then it was fine. I only gave it 3 stars because there is no temperature control. The coffee comes out luke warm and I like my coffee hot. Also, one drip hole drips faster than the other so if you make 2 espressos at a time you get one full cup and one 2/3 full. If you don't like it they don't do returns. My complaints only brought me time on the phone while they trouble shoot with you trying to get it right. Only problem is, the faults on this machine don't go away. If you work really hard you might get a warm cup of coffee so if you like it hot, it's not going to happen. UPDATE: After using this machine for 3 months and still getting lukewarm coffee, now the portafilter keeps getting stuck in the machine. Yesterday I left it in there so I could drink my lukewarm coffee but before I could drink the coffee the portafilter blew off the machine and bounced all over the counter.

I bought the Traxxas Skully which came with a car charger not a wall charger to charge the battery (cause we all live in our car and providing a car charger in place of a wall charger was smart of Traxxas) so I was forced to buy this additional charger so I can actually plug the battery into the wall. Steps are clear...do not plug the battery in to the charger first. First you plug the charger into the wall. CHECK! Then when it is solid Red you plug the battery into the charger. CHECK! This is where it should blink green indicating its charging, but of course mine just stays solid red and doesn't do anything. It doesn't even recognize the battery is connected. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the battery to make sure the connection was tight and good. Tried the steps all over again on a different wall outlet....nothing. I've only used the remote control car maybe 6-7 times total and that was using the provided car charger to charge the battery. This thing has been nothing but a pain, and this charger did not do its job. I will be issuing a return on this paperweight! \n Category: toy",

Then when you inform them of what you want they will (at least that's what happened to in this case) tell you they don't have that one either. Can't remember what cheap low end model they were trying to push, but that's what happened in this case. So we still haven't received any resolution to the issue. There are other brands out there, don't waste your time with Holy Stone. Oh, almost forgot, this particular model (there were two bought) have the following problems.

I watched all of the available videos before I ordered the sharpening system, when it arrived I read the manual a couple of times while looking at the system and then I watched all of the videos again as I set the sharpening system up. When I put my first knife on it I had a video playing so I could listen to it as I was going through the motions. I attempted to sharpen 6 Victorinox knives that are HC stainless and one carbon knife the carbon knife stained the stone so bad it no longer looks white it is red.

So my MAIN issue was, 6 days in the monitor began glitching had started flashing pink on the left side. I thought it was strange and thought nothing of it. Then it evolved to a full pink screen on the left side. That would stay for like 35 mins then disappear except lately it became permanent and no matter how I tweaked it it stayed their. So I’ve decided to return this garbage monitor, while my time when it didn’t have a pink half screen the picture quality was very good, and the 144hz is outstanding, 144hz makes 60hz look like the new 30fps while 144hz is the new 60, but that’s the only upside for me. Don’t get this monitor, buy another. \n Category: pc",

I noticed a bulge in the sidewall of one of the tires. This is dangerous! I contacted CS on amazon and kept getting disconnected on chat. They were no help because we were past the 30 day return period. The tires have maybe 100 miles on them. Amazon CS gave me a number to the manufacturer. I called them and was informed they hadnt sold on amazon for over 3 year. CS also tried to have me return them for a refund. They didnt seem to understand that the tires are mounted on a trailer and i'd need a new one before i can take the defective one off and send it back. Very frustrating! Do not buy these tires. \n Category: apparel",

The straps (as many have mentioned) are attached in a very flimsy manner, and in fact are attached such that they can’t help but separate. A linear pull on the straps or mat delaminates them because they are stitched backwards to the direction of force. An obvious design flaw. Furthermore, the mat lacks any heft at all to hold it down on the angled surface of the vehicle...it’s so light the force of gravity does not even overcome the memory curve you get if you keep it rolled up. Funny though - if you look at the product picture you can see the upward curve of the mat lol. Save yourself some money and go to Kmart, buy TWO bath mats with rubber backings and drape one over your vehicle, and place the other under the back end of your kayak to prevent scrapes as you angle it up onto your racks. You will pay 1/2 of the 40 bucks you would be shelling out for this mat and can use them to throw all of your wet gear on in the back of your vehicle when you’re done.

A complete waste of time and money. In addition, I ruined my perfectly functioning eye lash curler to try to get the squishy eye lash curler refills to fit.

This one, while the largest at 17\", is still much more cumbersome and inconvenient to use. The pivot handle is useless, don't bother with it. Be prepared to mow it in 4 different directions each mowing just to begin to get a smooth lawn. My lawn is well cared for, no crab grass, nice and green, no moss but this \"mower\" leaves streaks and because of the long deck and widely spaced wheels any bump in the surface either causes scalps or leaves uncut grass. I can't give it any less than one star but I sure would if I could. I do give it 2 stars for lightweight, after all it is plastic. Don't bother purchasing this mower, you'll be sorry. \n Category: other",

I installed the scrubber on my Polaris and after about two weeks it came off and was in the bottom of the pool. I put it back on but noticed it was a very loose fit. It came off again by the next day. I installed another new tail scrubber and it only lasted about to weeks before coming off. I had a new actual Polaris tail scrubber that was still in the package. Upon comparing the product the actual Polaris is a denser foam and has a smaller hole in the center so it fits tighter. I installed the actual Polaris and is been on a month now with no problem. I will not purchase this product again. \n Category: grocery",

It is louder than we thought it would be (at least as loud if not more-so than the window air conditioning unit we replaced). The exhaust tube is also very thick (about 8 inches in diameter) and is a real eye soar (its probably why the product is not pictured with the exhaust tube). Finally, there is a drip tube to collect water moisture, but if you live in a humid place like us, it will produce about a gallon of water every 2 hours - which means you constantly have to worry about it and frequently check to make sure it is not leaking water all over your floor. The display and some of the features are nice, but overall doesnt compensate for the problems. \n Category: home",

I wonder what Ken Follett thought of the way his book was butchered. I know it's a long book but It could have been handled a little differently instead of changing the story to fit the time slot. \n Category: other",

This is not ready for prime time: 1. Pairing is sporadic. Device is active, but sometimes presents itself to be paired, other times not. Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer. With my Lutron set-up, when I turn on the lights through the Homekit app, theres almost imperceptible lag time and 100% reliability to trigger actions, as it should be. \n Category: home_improvement",

My problem arose when the screen protector came off. I didn’t notice until I went to use my phone so I have no idea how long it was off. I cleaned the screen and put another one on, and not even 2days later it started to come off again.

I was tempted to replace the pair, since I really did love them, but it is not worth the risk since I would lose my return window. Seeing how small the weld is and the fact the the headphone band is spring steel which you need to flex constantly to put on or take off the headphones, I am really not sure of the durability.

You can’t simply screw them together, they have weird little tabs that have to somehow weirdly line up. I’ve had a few spills when this hasn’t been done right They are an awkward top heavy shape, so they tip over easily. This is extra annoying seeing as how they don’t have caps to at least protect the nipple if this happens. The measurement lines rub off fast and easy. I’ve washed the one pictured twice, by hand, super gently with dawn dish soap and air dried yet somehow the numbers rubbed off. They’re easy to clean though. So there’s that. You’re better off buying a different brand that has the units etched into the plastic so they can’t rub off.

And it never fails that when they do they ruin it. (Maybe the issue is that what's \"broken\" is their profit margins.) I had been using this product for maybe 15 years with great success. When I ran out of my last jug, I came here to Amazon to buy another and saw there were some negative reviews about the smell. Since I always found the smell very pleasant, I wasn't sure why people were leaving these reviews; I thought maybe they just didn't like it. Then, I saw there was an \"old formula\" being sold. Figuring they made a change, I decided to play it safe and get the \"old\" one. I didn't receive the old formula. (The seller was \"Washington Blvd Sales\".) Instead, I received what I'm positive must be the new formula -- which is awful. It has a headache-inducing perfume, reminiscent of what I remember lice shampoo smelling like. Not only does it not deter my cats peeing in the same spot, it doesn't seem to get rid of the urine smell anymore. I made the mistake of not trying it on a surface before using it. In my defense, I bought the \"old formula\" and assumed it was the same product I've been purchasing for years. Well, I sprayed my couch with it and now it smells like pee and this dreadful perfume. Thanks, Spectrum Brands. Your \"new formula\" has wasted my money and possibly ruined my couch. :( \n Category: pet_products",

That being said I noticed problems before the dog even saw the ball. For one, they use a metal washer to keep the string tied onto the ball. Be sure to remove that first before you give it to your dog or run the risk that your dog cracks a tooth and undergoes a painful (and pricy) surgery to have that corrected. When I took out the washer I double and eventually triple knotted the knot at the bottom to keep it in the ball. The dog just has to pull a little and the string pulls right through the ball and you have no handle on your dog or the toy. \n Category: pet_products",

It flew out of the clip while he took a turn, the screen protector and the phone screen itself broke, as did the kickstand on the shell. So needless to say, I'm unhappy. Especially since it meant replacing the phone, the screen was far too damaged to salvage, so I spent about $150 after purchasing and using ONE TIME this well-rated \"protective\" shell, hybrid screen protector, and belt clip that did not secure the phone.

Acting on this information, I went ahead to repurchase a new item to \"replace\" the item since I will be receiving the refund of the value. A couple of days later, I receive a phone call from Asurion changing their statement to state that they would instead offer a gift card instead of refund to my account. When I tried to explain that this defeats the purpose of replacing the item since I would have no use of the gift card, the customer service rep on the phone went ahead to school me on the difference between insurance and protection plans all the while avoiding a key mistake that an employee of theirs made by providing a different information earlier.

Basically fading techniques to gradually take away your babies sources of comfort until they comply. The second part is for those naughty babies who actually need more help getting to sleep.

The one thing it has going for it is its appearance, and I don't think that's enough reason to deal with its shortcomings. The section with the stars pops out slightly and maybe there's a reason for that, but it ends up picking up additional gunk and is extremely difficult to clean, in part due to all the star cutouts. Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous.

To get these two Sony pieces to work together should be easy, since they’re made to go together, but it’s a job most customers will find extremely frustrating and time-consuming. Following the instructions in the manual doesn’t work. After consulting Sony and the Community, and changing settings on the tv, I had to update the software on the sound bar, reattach it to the HDMI ARC input, and also connect an optical cable, even though the ARC connection is supposed to work without needing the optical. Of course Sony doesn’t supply an optical cable with their sound bar, like many other more generous sellers do. I would strongly recommend that buyers avoid this product and that Sony do some homework on making it better. If I had it to do over, I’d buy a different brand of sound bar and hang it on the wall. \n Category: other",

For VR you get about a half hour tutorial which, once you pass, will unlock a free paint mode. You're mostly painting 2D on walls but there is one level that you can paint in 3D. I don't know the relationship between the non-VR main story and this painting mode and I'm not going to play it to find out. I feel cheated! At best the description of this game is misleading. From the description on the product page you can't really tell what you'll get. I hope this review helps to deter anyone buying this game to only play in VR. Maybe this game is great in 2D but that's not what I was looking for. So, this game is more like Ace Combat 7 VR \"mode included\" where you play a few VR levels but not the actual game, and not at all like Resident Evil Biohazard VR \"mode included\", where you play the entire game in VR but have to watch a few cutscenes in 2D. I think Sony needs to come up with a third tier of branding for VR games like this...maybe say \"VR Content Included\", which would signify that you can't play the game in VR but you can do extra stuff that you'll need a VR headset/camera for.

            "input": "Reviews: Update - The company reached out to me just to tell me to use drag batteries (I used brand new Energizer batteries), use the reverse and forward (I used both every time), and evenly distribute (I did). The product isn’t good, it doesn’t work, it’s a waste of money, period. I bought this to make grinding weed faster...or so I thought. This device is probably best used for herbs and spices but not weed. This device doesn't allow for a good amount of weed to be put into it and you basically have to grind it down yourself to fit it in-between the teeth in order for the top piece to fit back on. So it holds very little herb. It gets stuck all the time and I constantly have to use the cleaning tool to get the weed out. I compared it to my handheld grinder and I got a lot more weed out of my handheld with a lot less hassle. It's a good concept but it just doesn't work well for weed. I also think it would be better if you could feed the weed through the cone-shaped top and then have it grind down instead. Because the reason I think this doesn't work is that in order for the top to go back on and work, you can only put in a minimal amount of weed and you must break it down into very small pieces which negates the entire reason I bought this. I am looking for a faster and easier way to grind a larger amount of weed at once. I would not recommend this for anyone looking to use it for weed. I can't say how it would be with other herbs and spices but since I have this, I may one day try it out for other use. Though I still think it will be more work since the area where you put the herb in is very tight and only allows a small amount inside in order to put the top piece back on. \n Category: lawn_and_garden",

Most companies send a reverse shipping code so you don’t have to pay for it, specially when it’s a falty item or an issue that is not the user’s falt. Anyways, a couple of weeks later I got a replacement shipped, but amazingly I also had to pay for importing fees as SanDisk decided to ship a new one from the US and declared the price for customs (it was a replacement, and there was nothing in the box saying it was a replacement. Customs just charged as if I had just bought a new item full price!) Does it works? It works. Would I buy again?

The wall mounts were weak and fell off after one day. I was so upset thinking that the other 2 were going to be the same way and couldn't imagine why this net was highly rated. WELL when the other 2 came they were of much better quality. The mesh net was strong and solid, the wall attachments were big and once I stuck them on the wall there was no getting them off! There was a nice 1 page explanation of how to place the wall attachments to assure the gate worked best. WHAT a difference! The puppy has pawed at it several times and has not ripped it nor has the pressure he placed on the mesh torn the wall attachments off the wall - BOTH of which happened with this cheap version.

Overall, with issues corrected, this gate will work for us because we have a small senior dog. I would not recommend for a younger, more agile dog prone to jumping, as it does not seem like a sturdy solution for retaining a more active pet.

            "input": "Reviews: I bought 5 suits: 2 marked US-XL 16 & 3 marked US-L 12-14. I am 5'7\" 185 lbs and wear a size 14. It took a full month to receive my order but I was excited to get them as summer is nearly here. The two black suits had absolutely no stretch to the fabric. They were clearly not sized correctly. I couldn't even get the L over my knees. If I had to guess the L was more like as size 4-6 and the XL was an 8-10. From what I could tell the fabric was also very thin and would have shown my butt crack, provided I could get it up that far. The next two suits were black with pretty coral flowers. These were sized a bit more appropriately. I could get the XL onto my body, but it wasn't pretty! The hips came up so high that they showed that ugly fatty part above my leg. The boob cups were made for someone with an A-cup and were very firm and cone shaped. My girls were spilling out of both sides because the cups didn't allow them to fit naturally. The last suit was black with red flowers and fit fairly well. I could at least get it on and the hip line was perfect. As I was pulling it up I heard a few stitches pop and when I adjusted the ladies I noticed that the boob panels were sewn off center giving the chest a very lopsided effect. The boob cups were better size and of a softer material that the previous suit however they were not sewn in and migrated all over the chest panel as I moved. Very disappointing purchase due to inconsistent sizing and poor quality. I will try to return however based on other reviews I've read I may just be out the money. \n Category: automotive",

I called Samsung and was told there was an error on my paperwork that put the date of manufacture versus date of purchase. Samsung warranty is a refurbished product 90 days after purchase. I was told to send back the refurbished one so they could send a new SSD. The process took a couple of weeks. I received my new SSD and in May it too failed. I again called Samsung and went through the process. The drive was defective and I was sent a refurbished SSD again. I called Samasung, again.

Not sure how accurate it was but assumed it was good to go based on all the high reviews. Today for the second time in two years, I needed a torque wrench. I’ve had my Tekton stored in a closet in its protective case and at the lowest torque setting as per the manufacturer’s instructions. I needed 10 ft lb torque (the lowest setting on my wrench) to torque two swing arm spools. On the first, it came very close to stripping the bolt, and I never heard a click but decided to stop before it got completely stripped. I blamed myself and assumed I had my allen bit at an angle. On the second spool I slowly twisted the wrench and again, no click. What I did eventually hear was the bolt being sheared in half. I was able to twist the broken half out of the swing arm, but there’s some damage to the black paint of the swing arm on a 2018 Yamaha R6. I’m going to try to get the company that makes the spools to send two more bolts, in the event it was their hardware, but I have ordered a different brand of torque wrench to try. I have a feeling it’s the wrench that caused the issue, as many of the 1 star reviews mention sheared bolts and the wrench not clicking or working for very long. And that makes sense. It’s $35-40 and made in Asia. If you want a quality mechanics torque wrench you probably have to man up and pay at least $150 for a CDI or $500 for a Snap On. I bought this cause I’m not a full time mechanic, but I’d rather not have a torque wrench than have one I can’t trust to not destroy my vehicles. \n Category: pet_products",

The handles may be heavy duty reinforced, but the remaining stitching of the bag is worthless. My tree comes in 4 parts. I put the middle two sections in one bag, zippered the bag and the seam split. The bottom section (largest and heaviest part of the tree) and the very top of the tree (smallest part) fit nicely in one bag, however when I went to zipper it up, one of the zippers fell off. I was glad there was a zipper on the other end of the bag to close it properly. I was not very happy with the product and I specifically bought two so I would not have this seam rip issue. To have the zipper just fall of the end of the other bag without even trying to close it was very disappointing. \n Category: home_improvement",

It was great after the first wash but the second & third just went downhill. I only wish each section of this comforter has a seal to keep all the fillings from separating. All the fillings are pretty much gone & this comforter went flat. The extra fillings left would move to the corner specifically to the feet corners which then drags the blanket off to each corner or off the bed. It’s very annoying that I have to shake the fillings to spread out evenly every night. I love how big the blanket is but this problem with the fillings piling up at the end of each corner & how flAt it has gone are a huge problem. I will be tossing this one out. It served well but unfortunately only a year. Before wash: It came inside a zipper bag. It was the perfect size. No damages. No stains. Not used. After wash: It took quite a while to dry since it was a very big blanket. High on dry and blanket came out great. No damages. No threads. No burn. I bought this oversize King for my queen duet cover. I read that to get it big & fluffy its best to buy a bigger insert for the duet. It was perfect. Big and fluffy. Made my bed looks extra soft and comfy. I'm always cold & will need about 2-3 blankets to keep me warm but this blanket was very warm. It kept me warm throughout the whole night. Maybe a little too warm that I kicked the blanket off the bed LMAO!! I think it is more on the heavy side & warmer. But it was perfect to cuddle & wrap my legs on top. My husband loves it as well. Overall, I would totally recommend this! \n Category: home",

We decided to replace it, and at least the second unit lasted about two weeks before its gears stripped too. Now we’re returning it (the replacement) for a full refund. UPDATE: about 14 months later (May 2019), we decided to risk getting a *third* one of these. Its gear stripped within 1 week of play. With one bad car, maybe we got a lemon. Two bad cars is very unlikely, but still possible. Three is astronomically unlikely. There is a manufacturing defect somewhere. We’ll be returning the third one and never buying another one of these again. The weird thing is that the other karts in this series (Mario, Bowser, Donkey Kong) don’t have this problem, or at least if they do it doesn’t appear right away (within the first two weeks). We know, because we’ve bought like 10+ of these over the last couple of years. (One of our dogs loves to play with them.) All three of the newer Yoshi models stripped their gears within two weeks, and none of the others did.

I bought these brushes because the design and shape of the handle while odd looking seemed very practical. It's long, curved with a disc-shaped collar that together would help save your hand from hot (potentially scalding) water while cleaning your expresso machine group head at several angles. HOWEVER, the bristles are so stiff and tightly packed with rough flat edges that it might as well be a stiff wire brush or a block of metal or wood. Instead of dislodging coffee grounds from the machine's group head it is likely to push them up into the holes insuring serious clogging with repeated use. It's like shoving or pushing the grounds up into the tiny holes. The more you use it the worst it will be. A clogged machine will require profesional attention or expensive thorough cleaning. Ironically the stiff bristles come \"protected\" inside a plastic cap. Maybe is to protect the plastic bag from the brushes. Perhaps these might be good to clean a toilet bowl rim or the inside of metal drain pipes. My first reaction was to throw them in the garbage and make sure to avoid products from this maker and vendor. But ill send them back so that maybe Amazon will realize how bad it is. \n Category: industrial_supplies",

After leaving it in for 2 hours (recommended by the website) I rinsed it out and got jet black with a couple blue patches where my hair has been bleached in the past. Needless to say I will not be wasting my money on this again. Go to Sally’s and buy bleach and ion semi-permanent color if you have dark hair.

The Chubby Cupholder profile is straight along the profile allowing many different cups to fit. The Drink to Go cupholder has a curved piece of plastic that will limit the number of cups it will accept. The Chubby Cupholder is only a couple bucks more expensive, but it has a better build quality and is more useful because it allows for a wider range of cups to fit.

There would be a little tab that allows you to pull the battery out of the insole They replaced the defective pair and the same thing happened with the replacement. I tried to glue the batteries back together but they continue to split. It is also hard to tell if they are working. There is a little green light that flashes when turned on, but it is hidden when inserted. There have been times that one turns on and the other doesn't.

What kind of quality control is in place to sent a bolt like the one in my picture? The answer is zero. You get what you pay for and this is a trash product. What you get is hex head bolts without the hex head cores cut Update: I went to Home Depot and after 15 minutes of searching the hardware aisle, found a specialty bolt with fine thread that would do the trick. Got home, went to put it in and then found the seat frame was defective too. There’s no threaded place drilled on that side for the bolt. I guess I could try and drill all the way through the seat frame, pick a longer bolt and cap it with a washer and nut. But this frame is so small it would be almost impossible to drill it perfectly straight and not completely damage the integrity of the chair. At this point, my best course of action may be to spend another 45 minutes disassembling and repackaging something that is 95% complete, wasting more time taking it to the UPS store, and get my money back. I’ll only be out the cost of gas, a new bolt and way too much of my time.

Neither of us is a train hobbyist; we purchased this to put on a table top around a small Christmas tree. Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together. \n Category: toy",

Although the description was inaccurate,that may have been a simple oversight as the blend of cotton to polyester in these socks was at one time true. I ordered these because they were described as cotton socks being primarily cotton with a lesser amount of polyester in the material. I thought this to be true as I had purchases them before from a retail store and was looking for an exact replacement. I hate how polyester socks feel on my feet. When I got the product, it is now a primarily polyester fabric with a lesser amount of cotton(in the 30% area if I remember right)making them polyester socks not cotton. I dont know why Hanes and Fruit of the Loom have stopped making cotton tube socks but it is really irritating. I am having no luck finding a suitable, quality replacement. To Amazon's credit they are paying the shipping for me to return them due to the inaccurate description which likely came from the manufacturer changing the blend without any more notice than the small fine print description on the back of the package stating the blend \n Category: apparel",

You have forcibly push the power button to get it to turn on or off, however the cord retraction button works if you just look at it. The vacuum will get a thermal shut off if you get animal hair caught in the wand, which is good to protect the vacuum but this is no where in the manual and the vacuum doesn’t tell you. Miele site and support tell you to bring it I’m for servicing at one of their stores. However thanks to the internet if you clear the jam and wait a few hours it works. The thing maneuvers terribly, it won’t move then smashes into everything when it does so if you have no furniture or painted base boards it’s probably fine. I just carry it. The carpet attachment meant for furniture and stairs isn’t powered so only use if you have a fresh bag since it works on suction. It is also not sealed so it jams with fur and you have to either buy a new one or disassemble and clean. Now the wand extension and retraction mechanism broke so I have to buy a new one or vacuum the house hunched over as it only stays at its smallest setting which is like 2 feet. We bought this on the recommendation of family and they felt so bad after they used it they offered to give us the money for it. The floor attachment has horrible suction and design, it pushes anything it finds rather than suck it up. You have to keep lifting it and placing it on top of where you want to vacuum to get it to suck up anything. I wouldn’t recommend this model to anyone. \n Category: home",

The original manufacturer A&D Medical claim this product is not allowed to be sold to the public as it is made for the Veterans Association and that it had to be sold by a gray market re-seller. Heart Rate Monitors USA the re-seller as listed on the Amazon Website stated that any claims had to be handled by Amazon as it was fulfilled by Amazon under the FBA program and they could not assist. After 2 hours of chasing I was able to get in touch with customer service at Amazon who despite thier protests that the product did not qualify for return finally agreed to refund the amount paid after I had threatened to dispute payment on the credit card charge. Amazon was the only party willing to step up to the plate to sort it out. The rest of those involved were totally disinterested.

Now keep in mind, I am an aquarist therefore I spent 8-10 hr shifts getting my feet wet, going up and down ladders, outside, inside, you name it.. so I need a closed toed sandal to do the job. I ordered half a size bigger - great choice because even at that the shoe was tight. First hour at work, I had a blisters all over my heels. Second hour at work, I slipped on DRY rocks while cleaning aquarium. Third hour, I slipped on a teeny weeny itty bitty bit of water while carrying an 8 foot ladder. - not pretty at all. I had to actually take off the shoes to be able to go up and down ladders safely. I was so excited for this product but see ya never Teva.

I let other people try this pre-workout and they often said they had to run to the bathroom atleast once. Somehow, it would often make my body get chills and feel cold, something I have never experienced in any other pre-workout. It did not mix well with water and often had a grainy after taste.

However, when these microphones arrived, there was a sticker across the entry point of the box saying that if I opened the package that they would not be returnable. Now, how exactly am I to determine whether these microphones work or if they suit my needs without opening the package? I went back and checked the listing page on Amazon for this product and found nothing that said that I couldn't open the box! A couple days after I contacted the company, they responded to say that I needed to contact Amazon for a return authorization and return them. Now, these microphones may, in fact, be fine but I'll never know because now I have to send them back, order something else and hope that they arrive before the event that I need them for. VERY disappointing and should explain why I gave them only one star. I don't know how I could have prevented this from happening, but I'm suggesting that other buyers beware of this company and their lack information concerning it's product policy and poor customer service. \n Category: musical_instruments",

As mentioned in other reviews, the drivers side headlight is not correctly keyed so the 9007 bulbs will not securely mount into the housing without modification. Also, I had all the lights in after hours of labor and when I finally went to adjust the lights the adjustment mechanism broke. Luckily I still had the factory housings and was able to use the adjustment mechanism off of them. Don't rely on this though because the lights are decades old and the plastic will be brittle. All I had to do was take everything apart again and reassemble. Also, don't forget to buy yellow bulbs for the parking lights. If you buy this product after reading this or the other review, it's at your own risk. You'll be spending a few hours of your time putting these in. Knowing what I know now, I would have paid double the price if it meant doing the job right the first time. \n Category: other",

Not a handle, not a crack in the face of the wood, but a broken piece of the cheap partical board that renders the entire drawer useless now. If you want an item you can just sit and look at this is your dresser. If you want something that functions, look elsewhere. Spend the money on quality.

The salon was also not able to take off the knot and had no choice but to chop it off leading to an extremely short haircut. I wanted to believe it wasn’t DevaCurl even though that had never happened prior to using the shampoo and conditioner, so it was decided that the product should be given a chance and then aside from getting even more dry the product started to thin the hair and making it fall.

I am kicking myself, shoulda just bought the cheap squishy FelPro ones and been good for another 10 years. The material is not soft, barely left an impression on the gasket, so I don't see how these would really seal all that well on the rougher cast iron edge of the head. Maybe they work better on machined surfaces and smooth aluminum covers, but they don't on older style engines. with sheet metal covers. And this is the first time I have ever had covers leak after replacing seals. \n Category: lawn_and_garden",

I tried to contact them on their website, but they didn't have my order number listed and didn't give me a claim number on the chat. Now I have no way to tell them I need the claim cancelled.

Was on phone with customer service for an hour having to literally ARGUE with an agent -- who refused for a long time to transfer me to a supervisor -- and then with a supervisor. After all that, no resolution. All they offered to do was pick up the machine and send it for repairs...but we'd have to stay home, waiting for pick-up, for a 2-3 day period -- which could not even be scheduled for a particular week. (We're leaving for vacation in a couple of days.) Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee. I've cleaned and re-settled all the external parts every way I can think of, to no avail. I'd expect better of a machine that cost half of much.

The last box I ordered suddenly seemed like a new product: no more Sesame Street characters (now they are generic) and the thickness of the diaper is reduced by at least 50%! I used to use cruisers for overnights as well as daytime but this new line of diapers are so thin and completely useless in terms of absorbency. Sure, they’re still soft, but quality has dropped so far that they are a totally different diaper compared to the old Sesame Street ones. I won’t be buying these again. \n Category: shoes",

Yes, I unplugged everything, and plugged it into a new outlet (which I know works because that outlet was powering my Apple TV before and after troubleshooting with no issues). Yes, I tried the original remote AND the buttons on the top. There is not even the little white LED light that comes on on the left of the sound bar when it turns on. This unit is dead.

To complicate matters even more, sometimes they were called by their first name and sometimes they were called by their last name. I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results. Had this been my first true crime book, I probably would have never read another one. I have read hundreds and this was one of the worst.

But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all! What a shame. \n Category: furniture",

For this product, they don't, the top of the round mold is so thin and light weight that it simply floats off, there is no mechanism to join the two they simply sit one on top of the other. For a mold this is an exceptionally poor design. The square mold suffers the same issue, its so thin walled and flimsy that it cannot hold its own shape even when full of water. If you are extremely careful and have a flat perfectly level spot to place the square mold full of water with extreme care and you don't move too fast from the sink to the freezer you may be able to act with enough gentleness to not disturb it and possibly get an ice cube.

I sent two different messages to the company, one about the damage box and the other how I thought the pool was going to be bigger than what it was (I actually forgot I sent two messages, but they sure did remind me). Needless to say I wanted to send the pool back afraid to use it incase it had any damage from the holes on the side of the box. I printed out the label and took it to the post office and it showed the company wanted me to pay for the shipping! The cost to ship it back was more than what I paid for the pool! I contacted the seller and they said I had to pay for the shipping because my reason for sending it back was because I didn't like it. But it was more about the damage and looking like I got a return from someone else, and I told them that! Also the inaccurate description, but mostly the damage! Whoever was emailing me back and forth was absolutely no help and told me I could send it back and pay for shipping or pretty much keep it and take my chances if its defective. He or she told me its \"my choice\". Real nice customer service! Even if it was because I didn't like the item, I still never took the pool out of the box because I was afraid it had holes in it and figured they could send me another one or refund me. I have placed orders through Amazon and 3rd party sellers before and I have never been given such a hard time about returning something and getting my money back! Honestly, don't waste your time with this place....total rip off! \n Category: toy",

It feels like someone has sucked all the moisture out of your body through your tongue and then slathered it chalk. I tried to mix it with water, tried to drink it ice cold, nothing helped that after taste. I threw the entire 11 and 3/4 pack in the trash.
