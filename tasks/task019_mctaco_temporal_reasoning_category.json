    "Definition": [
        "Indicate with `Yes` if the given question involves the provided reasoning `Category`. Indicate with `No`, otherwise. We define five categories of temporal reasoning. First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". Fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc."
