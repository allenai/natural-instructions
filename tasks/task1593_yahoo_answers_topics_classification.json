Since you asked \"how the human species evolved?\" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for \"fit\" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology.",

This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \"Self Reliance,\" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the \"independence of solitude\"). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a \"finished man\" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced \"perfect sweetness\" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \\nWhat do you think?",

Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction.

It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \\nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.  Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994).",

There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory.",

There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics.",

With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals.  \\nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.

Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \\n\\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \\n\\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\\n\\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\\n\\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \\n\\n\\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \\n\\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\\n\\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all.\" \\n\\n",

They introduce a break which is longer or more important than that introduced by semicolons, but not as final as periods.  Colons separate clauses which can stand as independent sentences grammatically, while semicolons can also be used for non-sentential clauses.\\nHowever, in modern writing the colon is rarely used in this role as glorified semicolon.  The colon has developed a specific semantics as a break separating an introduction from an explanation.  For example, the colon is used after the salutation in formal letters.  It is used to introduce quotes, separating the source from the quoted text.  A colon is used to introduce a list, included bulleted lists.

During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \\nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out” to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. \\nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.",

Back in 1961, DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters.  Some characters (Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth, while others (The Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom) were radically different.  \\nEarth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's, mostly adhering to the classic \"Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound\" description.  Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light, juggle planets, and had a host of super powers including super-breath, super-ventriloquism, and super-hypnotism.  Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's \"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\"  Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?,\" a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity.  Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character, which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.\\nEarth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since \"Crisis;\" once in 1999's \"Kingdom Come,\" and most recently in 2005's \"Infinite Crisis.\"  What his role is in this maxiseries is undetermined as of this writing.  Earth 1's Superman has yet to reappear, but longtime fans can always hope.",

You might find that aluminum might be too harsh for you, in which case you might find that steel or carbon might be more comfortable. That's just one example. Lots of test rides will give you a feel for how the various bikes at a given price point can handle very differently. Without getting into too much tech-speak, you might find that one bike handles a bit more twitchy than another. Think of the difference as driving a Mini Cooper versus a basic sedan. Some bikes are set up more for racing, where you'll get a quicker handling bike, whereas others will handle a bit more laid back.\\n\\nParts wise, you'll find the same component offerings on many of the manufacturers out there for a given price point, as TaraN pointed out. You'll most likely be getting a bike with Shimano componenets, with perhaps a mix of some of the manufacturer's own branded components (for example, Trek outfits their bikes with a lot of Bontrager componentry).\\n\\nFocus on the overall ride of the bike. For a $1000, you can get a lot of bike.\\n\\nWade at The Spokesman in downtown Santa Cruz is a GREAT guy - very helpful, and yes, very patient. He's very knowledgeable and will set you up right.\\n\\nAlso in that same category, I'd highly recommend seeing Vance Sprock over at Cupertino Bike Shop.

Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others.  Finally, one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator.\\n\\nThere are many combinations of pump sources, lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use.

We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still, we're not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.  Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas, potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil.

I will put my hand to my mouth.\\n5 Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further.\\n6 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said:\\n7 Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will question you; and you make Me to know.\\n8 Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?\\n9 And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His?\\n10 Adorn yourself with majesty now, and with grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor;\\n11 pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea, look on everyone who is proud, and bring him down low;\\n12 look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, and trample the wicked in their place;\\n13 hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.\\n\\nKnow that to contend to know G-d is to set yourself above him.\\n\\nA previous answer blasphemed: “G-d desires that we do not suffer, but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.”\\n\\nAnd also: “But there is a plan to alleviate the suffering.

Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn \"incentivizes\" people to answer questions.

It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or \"snoop\" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or \"inject\" unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\\n\\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\\n\\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\\n\\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now \"secure enough\" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or \"encrypt\" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\\n\\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!",

The brand *is* part of the value of an MBA, and frankly, the lower rated programs aren't that much cheaper.  Here in the Bay Area, Haas (Berkeley) has a great ranking (top 5 in part time rankings, recently been in the top 10 for full time).  I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region.  Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program.\\n\\nI agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it.  Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student.  I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student.  It opens a lot of doors.  But you need to be very goal directed to get this value.\\n\\nI can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good.  As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now.  Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks.\\n\\nSo - to your actual question.  If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously).  Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program.  But talk to people, figure out how *you* can gain value from an MBA, and then go from there.",

So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation.

As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\\n\\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\\n\\nIs average height an example of this? It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average, and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example. It should be noted however that who we think is desirable for sex is very culturally dependent and may not lead to the best long-term (breeding) prospects for an individual conceived to those parents.",

When the long one\\ngets to 18 miles, you can do it every third weekend, covering 8-9 miles on the \"short\" weekends.\\n\\nAfter about the third week of training, insert a one min jog into your runs, after 4 min of walking. If this feels fine after 2 weeks, drop to 3walk/1jog. After 3 more weeks, drop to 2-1. If all goes well after another 3 weeks or so you could go to 1-1 during the week, and 2walk/1jog on the long run.\\n\\nFind the ratio that works best for you, that will leave you feeling strong at the end, and recovering fast from these long ones. The pace for all of\\nthese should be very, very slow.",

It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\\n\\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\\n\\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel.",

Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\\n\\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\\n\\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.  The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming.  Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.\\n\\nIt's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself.  Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\\n\\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\\n\\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\\n\\nwhere N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year.  \\n\\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\\n\\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\\n\\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year.",

I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. \\n\\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\\n\\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\\n\\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\\n\\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\\n\\n4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\\n\\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\\n\\nhope this helps?",

That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles.  The very high voltage there is stepped down using a transformer to supply most houses and businesses with a usable lower voltage.  The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.  Incidentally there may be an additional single wire above all the rest to arrest lightning strikes.",

The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too.

The Controller is responsible for allocating HTTP requests to the appropriate Action handler (Model) based on configuration mappings.\\n\\nThe Model contains the business logic for the application. The Controller then forwards the request to the appropriate View component, which is usually implemented using a combination of HTML with PHP tags in the form of templates. The resulting contents are returned to the client browser, or via another protocol such as SMTP.\\n\\nphp.MVC is a PHP port of Jakarta Struts.

A period of legal separation constitutes grounds for divorce; the length of that period varies from state to state.    Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple may reconcile, in which case they need do nothing in order to remain married. If they do not reconcile, and wish to divorce after the statutory time period, they must file for divorce explicitly.\"",

If so, then this is what's called a \"disqualifying disposition\".  In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price).  \\n\\nIn general, the IRS wants you to pay tax in the quarter in which the related income is earned.  So you theoretically should pay the estimated tax at your standard income tax rate in the same quarter you exercise and sell ISOs.  You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return.     The following information is sourced from See http://www.fool.com/school/taxes/taxes35.htm. \\n\\n1.  The simplest way is just to suck it up and not worry about paying a penalty for underpayment of taxes.  Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000).  Be wary though that you probably can't keep doing this year after year without the IRS getting on your case. \\n\\n2.  Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\\n\\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\\n\\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\\n\\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill.  This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\\n\\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000.   If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\\n\\n\\n\\nClear?  As mud?\\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\\n\\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%).  \\n\\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.  However, that's a topic for a whole 'nother question/answer.   \\n\\n\\n* Even with NQSOs, if the amount held at source is less than your eventual tax rate for the year,  you may be subject to tax penalties unless you meet one of the exceptions listed in a) through d) above.",

With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.  The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.  The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\\n\\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.  The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\\n\\nA couple things to consider, though.  In order to switch to a double compact, you need to replace a fair number of components, including the bottom bracket, cranks, rear derailleur (optional but highly recommended), front derailleur and possibly your left shifter.  You might be able to get what you want from switching out the cassette on your bike, which is of course a lot cheaper.",

            "input": "Stock option grants and stock grants are two forms of compensation often offered as incentives in addition to base salary offered to a newly hired employee. This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. \\n\\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. The set price is called the strike price. When you (the stock option holder) make use of your right to buy/sell stock according to the terms of the option, you are exercising the option. Call options are options giving you the right to buy stock. Put options are options giving you the right to sell stock. Employers grant call options to employees. Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. Let's say it's after four years now. Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\\n\\nStock grants are simpler to understand. The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. So let's use the Google example again. Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\\n\\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. This is done to give employees an incentive to stay at the company.",

An animal that is preyed upon by many enemies has its eyes out on the sides of its head: each eye with its own field of vision. For example, a cottontail rabbit can see what is above, behind, on either side, and in front of it except what is right before its nose. He probably does not see the clover leaf he eats. Species which are hunted by other animals but which are predators themselves at times, commonly have eyes that are a compromise.

Alpha Test was the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated after the model had been in production a while.\"",

Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles.  Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\\n\\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \\n\\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \\n\\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\\n\\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\\n\\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?",

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\\n\\nPopulation\\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\\n\\n\\nName\\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word \"Chelokee\" meaning \"people of a different speech.\" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) \"principal people\" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) \"people of Kituhwa.\" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\\n\\n\\nSub-tribes\\n\\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \\nLower",

But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight.",

This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). Drawing from the legacy of the Civil Rights movement, advocates of full inclusion for children with disabilities state that \"Inclusion is the ultimate goal for all children with disabilities regardless of their disabilities or current placement\" (New York State Education Department, cited in Shanker, 1993). This is not without controversy. Among the most vocal opponents are those in the deaf community, who feel that their culture and language are at stake (Cohen, 1994) and the Learning Disabilities Association of America, which believes that mandatory full inclusion policies violate federal law (\"Full inclusion,\" undated).",

You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\\n\\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. Learn, and let it be your choice. If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\\n\\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\\n\\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). You can learn more on different religions by following the links below.\\n\\nI know in China most Christians are unitarian, since in 1949 the Government forced denominations to form one single church or leave China.\\n\\nRemember learn before you act, and don't let anyone influence you.

Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.\\n\\nGoogle has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.\\n\\nCons of Google:\\n\\nHowever, few problems with google, its web crawler dosen't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net, a feature which Yahoo provides.\\n\\nAlso, Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler, a feature which Altavista provided since 1999. The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\\n\\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs. Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush's name, the #1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.\\n\\nYahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies, for example Grokker.\\nhttp://www.grokker.com/grokker.html?query=Anirudh%20Koul&Yahoo=true&Daypop=true&numResults=250",

The same year, a 12-foot pyramid of 2,400 jelly doughnuts was built near Afula, Israel; the pastries were later distributed to soldiers serving near the northern border. \\n\\nHanukkah began this year (2005) on the evening of December 25.\\n\\nSee poster:\\nhttp://www.allposters.com/-sp/Menorah-w-toys-candy-and-gifts-in-background-Posters_i1459268_.htm",

            "input": "The short answer is, yes, of course they are tracking IPs.  The long answer to your other question follows.\\n\\nIt is a straight-forward, multistep process.\\n\\n1. Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\\n2. Collect proof of misdeeds for each particular P2P service that is allowing illegal file copying.\\n3. Sue the P2P service and demand they hand over IP addresses of offending users.\\n4. Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\\n\\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\\n\\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\\n\\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\\n\\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\\n\\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\\n\\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\\n\\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school.  It makes them get a higher grade than they deserve and if the test is graded on a curve, your A- work can wind up being counted as a B+.  \\n\\nWell, songwriters composed that music and/or lyrics, musicians practiced and learned to play that song and paid to use a recording studio to perform it in.  When people don't pay to hear that play, the musicians still have their expenses to pay but no royalty check to pay for it. They lose money doing what they love.\\n\\nEven if someone cannot afford a whole album they can still afford to buy their favorite song for 99 cents.",

So, I guess my recommendation regarding root canals would be that if you are a healthy person, with a good immune system, a root canal would probably be a good option, rather than losing your tooth.

Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a \"feed\").\\n\\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication \"universe\" right away. Free readers are available as well; a search for \"RSS Reader\" at popular search sites will yield many results.\\n\\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). Also, any upgrades or new features are added automatically. The trade-off comes in different (some would say fewer) features and slightly slower performance versus desktop systems. NewsGator, Bloglines, and new RSS content capabilities in My Yahoo! are probably the three best-known examples of web-based feed reading services.",

The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive, but all your friends that may get cancer...",

When you look below the surface, the world is filled with evidence that leads open minded people to conclude that evolution has occurred.

If the god of intelligent design violates the natural laws he created to create living organisms and to create false evidence, how often does he do this?

The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\\n\\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\\n\\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\\n\\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\\n\\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\\n\\n\\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX",

            "input": "Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. The trade-off made is convenience for speed. Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. Their work has yet to be completed. The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\\n\\n\\nStandards\\n\\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. This would ensure compatibility.\\n\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\\n\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. The setup would most likely begin with a router. This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. These allow any wired device to be included on the network. The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\\n\\n\\nAdvantages/Conclusions\\n\\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. Only then should 802.11n be considered.",

Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\\n\\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. It is contained in our mitochandria. Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key \"markers\" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\\n\\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. Let me give you an example. Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. Others will not be so lucky. If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are.",

A bit back, I emailed a fellow who simply wished the question of motivation could be answered.\\n\\nI think the 2 most frequently asked questions that I address in my Beginners' Guide to Fitness and Bodybuilding are:\\n\\n1) How do I get motivated?\\n2) How soon can I expect to see results?\\n\\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\\n\\nPassion\\n\\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\\n\\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\\n\\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\\n\\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. Without it, they would just be average.\\n\\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\\n\\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\\n\\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out. You can be very successful just doing 45 minutes a session, 3 times a week. You don't need to live in the gym or spend every second thinking about working out.",

I've lost right at 150 lbs. & I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :)\\n\\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity...don't know why. Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\\n\\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of \"bad nasties\". I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store...Victoria's Secret, to be exact. My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. But it just hit me oddly. I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\\n\\nThat's what did it...that's what started the whole process. By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. So, here's how I handled it...\\n\\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want...I'm not kidding. True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating but I also don't beat myself up about it. If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. The big problem for me was breads.\\n\\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\\n\\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes where you can.\\n\\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages...OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! But you know what? I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! That's motivation, I can promise you...\\n\\nMy suggestion after all",

Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language).  Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life.

You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \\n\\nYou do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.\\n\\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \\n\\nHope this helps!\\nGoodluck,\\nDave",

At the genetic level, cystic fibrosis is most often the result of an in-frame deletion of three base pairs in the DNA. Cystic fibrosis results from the production of an abnormal form of a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR functions in transporting chloride ions across epithelial cells found in the lung and intestinal tract. In CF patients, CFTR does not function properly, causing accumulation of ions inside epithelial cells. Since water follows ions by osmosis, this results in water depletion and viscous mucus on the surface of alveoli. The most common CFTR protein abnormality is a mutation termed ΔF508, which is characterized by the deletion of the DNA basepair sequence at chromosome location 7q31.1 that codes for a single amino acid, phenylalanine.",

Why should you believe in somehting of which there is no proof?  \\n\\nIn my personal opinion, there are only three reasons people become religious:\\n\\n1)  They are fearful.  Fearful of death, fearful of not knowing the purpose of their existence, fearful of losing everything that they value in this life (which you will, gauranteed).  Fear is a powerful motivator and when someone offers you a way to manage that fear through a belief system it can be tempting to accept.  There is no need to resort to philosophy, science or psyhcology.  There is no need to accept that there are rational and scientific explanations that we as humans simply don't know yet.   Just believe that someone's making it all right in the end and you're all set.\\n\\n2) They are seeking a path to redemption for past sins.  They are having difficulty coping with the consequences of some bad action they have taken in thier life, and or are trying to control some compulsive behavior that has caused hardship in their life.  Either they were in prison, got caught with a prostitue, or drank themselves out of job and their family, or simply told a horrible lie that they feel guilty about.  Religion offers instant redemption and rituals to help you ease your mind through repentance.  \\n\\n3)  They have a strong natural desire for community and companionship.  Having someplace to go every Sunday with likeminded people or having rituals to follow when someone dies, or having a language or framework to use when communicating your values with others can be very comforting.  If your family already subscribes to these beliefs you even may feel pressure to accept things that your logical mind tells you are impossible and&#92;or unlikely.\\n\\nYou can deal with these three situations through patience, meditation, compassion, seeking help from others, and community activism, or you can choose to believe in supernatural beings and mythology.  My personal opinion is that there is no easy way out of any problem so that when a christian says I can instantly have my sins forgiven or a Scientologist tells me that body thetans are causing my suffering, or some guru tells me that my Shakras just need alignments, I usually take a pass.",

A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\\n\\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\\n\\nHow is vasectomy done?\\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\\n\\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \\n\\nPage 2 of this Article \\nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\\nThe Doctor's Response\\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below −300°F (−185°F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period. However, there is considerable debate over the scientif",

But when in love, we often miss the red flags, so if that happens, here are what I consider serious and justifiable grounds:\\n\\nAdultery -- many people can't move past this.  It's a physical betrayal, but also tears at you emotionally.  I personally think it's one of the most difficult ones to resolve.\\n\\nAbuse -- physical or verbal.  Verbal often gets overlooked, but it's namecalling, screaming at you rather than holding a normal conversation, talked down to, and did I mention yelling and screaming?  If you ask the person a normal question, like \"do you have any change for the toll?\" and they start screaming that \"all you do is harp about money,\" you've got a problem.  Physical is obvious, but don't overlook punching walls, breaking dishes, etc.  Watch out for signs of roughness or  meanness to your children and pets too.\\n\\nControl Freaks:  This is also a form of abuse, but these men want to know your every move, monitor your phone calls, read your email and voice mails, won't let you go to the mall alone, etc.  Insist that if you get a new hairdo or buy a new dress, it must be because you're cheating with someone.  This is usually disguised as jealousy which women may think lattering -- at first.  Don't be fooled.  Control freaks also don't want you to hold a job or have any money of your own.  You must beg for an \"allowance.\"\\n\\nFinancial:  There are a lot of men who live off women.  They have jobs when you meet them.  Then, something happens, and it's always the company or bosses fault.  They tell you they're out job hunting, but nothing is happening.  Next comes laying around on the couch all day, sleeping, watching tv or guzzling beer.  Weeks turn into months and it's just you working.  Or, the person flits from job to job and can't hold a job.  This man will plunge you right into financial ruin and guess what -- you can't get them out of the house all that easy, if it happens to be your house and not a joint home.  Keep an eye out that they don't dip into your wallet.  A dollar or two missing, here and there, usually becomes much more.  You'll get behind on bills, your credit will suffer.  Don't stand for this.\\n\\nAddictive behavior:  Drugs, alchoholism, gambling.  Will cause you nothing but stress, pain and financial hardship.  Don't try to be the hero and \"help\" the person out of despair.  Unless you are rich enough to get them into very good rehab, like the movie stars do, it probably won't work.  Addicts can only be helped if they want to be and you'll be surprised how many enjoy the behavior and have no desire to give it up.  I've seen men go to AA or a counseling session, come right out and stop at a bar.  It is almost a joke with them.  You may keep gamblers out of casinos, but they'll spend a whole paycheck on lottery tickets or the football pool.\\n\\nIllegal behavior:  Selling drugs, stealing, pulls insurance scams, (or any scams), etc., RUN.  He'll eventually get caught and you might get implicated too!  Do you want his record to become yours?\\n\\nGood luck.",

I couldn't hold them to myself. There was a need to share them with her that I just couldn't imagine keeping inside.\\n\\nBut that's me - and not everyone is the same. Some people are emotionally sheltered and prefer to keep their feelings hidden away. Body language, gestures, and general mood and disposition toward you can give you clues as to how your significant other really feels. The question you need to ask, when you're finding yourself actively looking for attention like this, is whether or not you can be happy in the long term under these circumstances.\\n\\nPeople are tough to change, and if this is something you need, and your significant other is having a hard time dealing with that... you may need to re-evaluate your situation, or have a long and frank discussion with them regarding this.",

This will sound corny, but give it a shot:  First, if you've got kids, send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing (say on a Friday).  Next, turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home.  Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table, and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom--or whereever you're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred.  Personally, I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background. Music is important to setting the mood, and if you've got cable or a dish, you can tune it to the music of your choice. Just before he gets home, slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe.  When he gets to the door, be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you've got in store for the evening.  Not in a crude way, mind you.  Most importantly, take your time...don't rush.  The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself.  Hope that helps!\\nPeace,\\nJayZ",

Common misunderstandings surround their name origin, removal reasons and\\npain sources, according to the Academy of General Dentistry, an organization of\\ngeneral dentists dedicated to continuing education. \\n\\n\"The name 'wisdom teeth' is age related - third molars don't erupt until teenage\\nyears and beyond, when people theoretically are more wise to the world,\" says Trey\\nPetty, DDS, FAGD, spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry.\\n\\nCommon reasons for wisdom teeth removal include impaction, pain and crowding of the\\nother teeth, which are typical tooth growth characteristics.\\n\\n\"If wisdom teeth are not visible, they are impacted or unable to erupt due to space\\nand size limitations,\" says Dr. Petty. \"Impacted teeth don't have enough room to grow,\\nand will lay beneath the gums, which may or may not be a problem.\" \\n\\nPain and tooth crowding are also top wisdom teeth problems. \"Adults have forgotten\\nwhat normal pain from a growing tooth feels like,\" says Dr. Petty. Complications also\\ncan arise when wisdom teeth partially erupt. The broken gum acts as a breeding ground\\nfor bacteria and germs. \\n\\n\"When wisdom teeth partially erupt, food gets caught in the gums and may cause an\\ninfection, swelling, growth of a tumor or cyst and pain,\" says Dr. Petty. \"If this\\nhappens, consult a dentist before problems worsen and affect overall oral health.\"\\n\\n\"If wisdom teeth have erupted, the key to preserving them is maintaining good oral\\nhealth by brushing twice a day and going to see a dentist twice a year,\" says\\nDr. Petty.",

If you have dentures or a removable appliance, such as a retainer or mouthguard, clean the appliance thoroughly before placing it back in your mouth.

Don't put on a front, be your true self, and eventually you and your soul mate will find each other. I followed what I've written here and it worked for me. My husband and I are truly soul mates and have been married a little over three years now.
