        "You will be given two pieces of text with the same meaning. One of them is simpler and easier to understand for non-native English speakers. Complex texts may contain more difficult words, have unnecessary phrases or contain long sentences. Your task is to choose the simpler piece of text. You are expected to output 'Text one' if the first sentence is simpler. Otherwise output 'Text two'."
