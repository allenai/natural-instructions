	"Definition": "Given an action statement, generate another action statement such that they cannot be conclusively differentiated into more or less ethical.",
	"Positive Examples": [
		{
			"input": "telling my friends sister that she probably won't get a celebrity to go to prom with her",
			"output": "breaking off a 'friendship' and leaving it as business only",
			"explanation": "The answer cannot be differentiated from the given input since they are both morally incorrect"
		},
		{
			"input": "ruining the mood",
			"output": "adding parsley in friend's breakfast",
			"explanation": "It cannot be conclusively said that the given action is morally more or less wrong. Since both of them seem quite harmless actions."
		}
	],
	"Negative Examples": [
		{
			"input": "being angry at some one canceling last minute",
			"output": "quitting a volunteer position after completing the training",
			"explanation": "Quiting a position after completing the training process may hurt the organization who have trained the person. On the other hand, there is quite logical to be angry at someone who cancel plans at the last minitue. So the answer is less ethical than the given action."
		},
		{
			"input": "taking my son's PS4 he bought himself",
			"output": "not knowing anything about computers",
			"explanation": "taking son's object which he bought himself with his own money is insensitive and might hurt his feelings. On the other hand, not knowing something can be dealt with by learning further and does not harm others in any ways. So the answer is more ethical than the given action"
