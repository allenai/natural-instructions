    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two questions about a domain. Your task is to combine the main subjects of the questions to write a new, natural-sounding question. For example, if the first question is about the tallness of the president and the second question is about his performance at college, the new question can be about his tallness at college. Try to find the main idea of each question, then combine them; you can use different words or make the subjects negative (i.e., ask about shortness instead of tallness) to combine the subjects. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \"this national park\", \"this dog breed\", and \"this president\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in the new question, this keyword should also be used the same way. Do not write unnatural questions. (i.e., would not be a question someone might normally ask about domains). Do not write open-ended or subjective questions. (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.) If you couldn't find the answer to your question from a single Google search, try to write a different question. You do not have to stick with the original question word for word, but you should try to create a question that combines the main subjects of the question."
