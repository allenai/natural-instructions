        "In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question about the events that may happen before or after a certain event. For example, \"earning money\" usually appears before \"spending money\". Note that a lot of the questions could have more than one correct answer. We only need a single most-likely answer. Please try to keep your \"answer\" as simple as possible. Concise and simple \"answer\" is preferred over those complex and verbose ones."
