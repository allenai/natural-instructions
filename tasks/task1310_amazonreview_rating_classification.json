Snap traps should be your first approach as they are fast and clean kill but when used correctly sticky traps can be valuable, especially in the case of young mice that won't set off snap traps due to how light they are. Be certain to set the sticky trap in a spot where other animals won't potentially come in contact with them. Trapping birds, snakes or lizards (or your household pet) on these boards would be horrific! Be sure to check them daily if not several times a day. Once you have caught a mouse chances are it's still alive and the kindest thing to do is to quickly dispatch it. I've used a snap traps for this, placing a liner over the mouse to allow the snap trap to make clean contact instead of getting stuck in the goo and prolonging the process. Baiting the trap isn't necessary, just place it along walls the mice or rats use. You may discover you have more than one mouse in an area if you place a rat size trap out for mice. Please, please, if you can't resolve the situation with snap traps alone than use these but NEVER resort to rodent poison if at all possible! The horrible damage it does to wildlife is astronomical as it doesn't stop with the rodent but is passed on to every predator and scavenger in the ecosystem.",

While the image holds it's definition on larger screens, there just doesn't seem to be any \"remarkable\" increase in sharpness or visual quality over the DVD. I found no issues with the audio presentation. Everything sounded perfectly clear. This season definitely sets itself apart in terms of style. Rich and vibrant colors are plentiful, and there is no shortage of music. Characters are well fleshed out and I found the writing to be adequate. Wes Bentley handles a leading role as best he can, but Evan Peters portrayal of the psychotic Mr. March was worth the price of admission alone. Series regular Jessica Lange did not return for this season, but her absence is barely noticeable. All in all, it's an interesting season. It's extreme in all the ways that a story about a hotel full of psychopaths, vampires and murderous spirits could be. While the presentation is not as vivid as I'd hoped to see on Blu-ray, the extra physical durability and slight visual uptick in picture quality delivered by the format still make this a solid choice over the DVD.",

Space a couple more in the middle. PURELY OPTIONAL - Dip or brush screws with white paint BEFORE installing them (if you do it after it is really tough not to have any spots of over-paint and your white paint won't be a perfect match so it will show).

There is no propping up at any angle with this one. That said, I feel the position is natural and comfortable when on my back. My old pillows always left my head tilted up slightly when on my back so it took time to accept that this new position was good. Maybe it's more mental than physical? My other comment is that I sleep on my side a lot. The support under my neck doesn't feel like it is there. Maybe I should get the firmer pillow to see if that does better - could be my size. I also wonder if it's me and the introduction to a totally new type of pillow makes it seem like there's not enough support for side-sleeping. I can say the amount of neck pain in the past few mornings seemed to have diminished. Still some lingering, but no where near what I had before. Took a few mornings to get to this place and so far I'm pretty happy. Would I buy another pillow like this, yes. I actually will buy the firmer one at some point to see if my hunch is right. For now I continue to use the pillow and I have been sleeping well.",

With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results.

I tried it before adding milk. The taste of the tea was far less strong than the scent of the tea. Without milk, it made for a delicate and pleasant tea. I could have even let it steep another minute. For the tea to have a full-bodied flavor with milk in it, I had to leave the bag in as I drank it or steep 2 bags at once for 6 minutes. Of course, personal tastes determine how a person likes their tea, but this review may give you a general guideline.

The sound (which is most important) underperformed. I have a pair of $40 Ausdom bluetooth headphone that sounds waaaay better from mid-high and especially lows. 3. The bluetooth kept disconnecting on ALL of my devices. This never happened with my cheap ones. 4. I believe like another reviewer mentioned...they are ear heavy. This part didn't bother me too much, as they were still fairly comfortable and not too tight. However, somehow there is an imbalance with the weight of the top part (that goes over your head) because with even doing light activities while wearing them they would start to fall off. Again, my cheapies never had this problem and I've had them for over a year. 5. No bag, case or really any extras besides the charging usb cord and aux cord for when you're not using the bluetooth. This would've been perfectly fine if the main purpose was fulfilled (\"the sound\"). 6. All in all, I loved the name of the headphones (which did influence my purchase) and the look. Using real leather is something that is usually on more expensive headphones. But because these are headphones, not a handbag they still need to sound great too. It's like a beautiful woman with no personality or a bad attitude...not worth the headache. 7. Perhaps an updated version would greatly suit this product and I would remain optimistic in giving them a second chance.",

My problem is I got one shade with some junk stuck between the layers, directly opposite of the seam on the shade, so it isn’t easily hidden, because you either get seam or what looks like a spider, to look at. Only really noticeable when light isnt on, or you know it’s there, and you think what the heck is that? (Because you think spider!)

When I do help in the kitchen I have to follow a recipe to the letter. This book was beyond perfect. It lays out your shopping list, it says while this is cooking on the stove, defrost this in the microwave, and work on chopping this. I followed every step as it is laid out except instead of one 3hr session I did two hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. Instead of molds, I used breast milk bags to store all of my prepared baby food and let them lay flat to freeze. Then the book also has the meal plan laid out so I didn't have to do any thinking there either. It shows which food to introduce which day and all I had to do was check that schedule and then have what I needed for the next day in the fridge to defrost so that I could just grab a baggie, pour it into a bowl, and heat it up! Traveling was also a non-issue as I didn't have to rely on storebought baby food. I could just put my baggies in a travel cooler and have what we needed at the ready. If I wasn't going to be able to heat it through I just swapped out for things that were okay to eat cold or at room temperatures like apple puree or pear puree. I'm telling you, this book could be titled how to introduce foods and prepare all of your baby food for dummies. I'm so grateful to the author. Everyone who wants to make baby food NEEDS this book!",

It will charge, show full charged and that is where the good news stops. The truck takes off full throttle without the controller being pressed in reverse and then when I press the throttle it stops. The manufacturer seemed willing to swap for a replacement but looking at the costs associated with having to ship it back to the manufacturer for repair/ replacement just wasn’t worth it as I was too busy to get to the PO. I didn’t find it fruitful to spend the cost of a new product to ship this back. At this point it is a paper weight in my garage.

Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony.

I'm not a hardcore audiophile but most of the in ear headphones that I've used either have decent bass response but sound dull on the higher frequencies or have clear highs but wind up sounding tinny because of poor low end performance. Most headphones use either balanced armature or dynamic drivers each of which has its pros and cons. These incorporate both types of technology into their drivers . I'm not a sound engineer but the end result is deep resonant bass, bright clear highs and warm midtones with excellent separation between instruments. They are also loud. The noise cancelling is just passive, which is the only downside, but active noise cancellation adopted for earbud style headphones has it's own set of drawbacks. At $60 they aren't cheap but they sound a lot better than Beats that are twice as much money. I'm very happy with them and I think they are a relative bargain.",

Simple as that, for anyone who doesn't like that feature.

It wasn't easy to do that so I left the cover on, but removed the straps to be washed (baby kept gnawing on straps and getting food on them).

So I will preface that this computer was barely USED by me until 3 months ago, and I've had nothing but problems since. There was no physical damage as far as I could tell however I've been having problems since I've decided to use it regularly: The wifi is very unstable and sometimes nonexistent, since I had to move from my laptop to using this desktop, I've been attempting to play games with my friends, only to disconnect every 30 minutes. Now I originally thought the issue was my internet provider, but none of my other devices were having issues. I decided to investigate my router, no issues at all. I move to the pc and I noticed that the usb dongle they include that either assists (or allows not even certain at this point anymore) the wifi connectivity was no longer operating. I removed it, and plugged it into my old laptop, it functioned, I attempted to use it on a different port, nothing. I decided to swap the usb with one that I knew was working, and it didn't work, AND afterwards that port ceased to function until next restart. THIS WAS ONLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF ACTUAL USAGE. (Computer was left untouched for most of a year and picked up for primary usage in May). I've been having this problem quite consistently with the ports, and I recently attempted to contact skytech support, of which all of their lines were busy and they had me leave my name and phone number and they'd get back to me as soon as possible. I called at 11 am PST (of which they are open until 5pm PST) and I didn't receive a call since. Now while this problem is quite recent, I would like to point out that this PC is not HTC VIVE compatible due to the fact that there is a significant lack of ports that actually function, some of the ports are not connected to the card which means they will NOT function whatsoever, so if you are using this computer for VR, your only option really is to get a RIFT S for it.",

The wifi repeaters that was sent to extend the signal of the cameras means that every camera has to be COMPLETELY uninstalled and taken down from the walls and roofs that they are mounted to, which means cutting the conduit tubing that is protecting the wires since they are outdoors. THEN bringing each camera inside to the nvr and programming each one once connected to the nvr. Then after all that HOPEFULLY it all WORKS! (<--probably won't) Then at that point we can go back and completely install each camera like we had originally mounted them. So that means all new screws, new tubing, more time and definitely MORE MONEY wasted!!! Had I known this I promise I never would have bought these. Another problem is that even with a couple of the units that are close enough to have a FULL signal record in odd increments! The playback of the video shows there's motion but then completely SKIPS and JUMPS through all that motion so you can never even see what actually triggered that motion to begin with. I have it setting to record all cameras 24/7 plus I have motion to record in the 'continue setting' but like I say they jump allover the place. HORRIBLE. I can only assume the people that state they love this system and that are \"Verified Purchases\" must have some tiny houses cause they don't have these issues. And must have extensive networking experience cause I still can't even get these to port-forward through my router correctly to view them from our mobile devices when we are not at home. ---------------------------------------- I purchased the 8 camera 1080p wireless system with 2TB drive already installed and at first had a few problems with these cameras maintaining connection. By contacting customer service we discovered the house and distance between the cameras and the NVR was simply too large and far between. Grace with their great customer service team advised that even a longer antenna would not suffice so instead she acquired approval to have them send a wifi repeater or extender system that will essentially make up for the distances. I hope once that is all set up, installed, and programmed that it should all be working great then.",

I use the bright white during the day and the off-white is better for working in the evening. The brightness is adjustable by just touching the level button, which I can use as the sunshine or lack thereof outside my window changes. It has a USB port, which is AMAZING and perfect for keeping my smartphone charged. It even has a timer feature I can touch before leaving my sewing area in case I get tied up elsewhere and can't come back to it right away.

Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far.

Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him.",

Bike to bike is actually pretty loud I could hear my buddy fine even at 85 mph (he was hearing a bit of wind noise though). Music is a bit quieter followed by answering phone calls paired to a mobile phone being almost too quiet (before moving the speakers). Music quality is obviously not great but at this price point I was not expecting it would match any set of headphones. Battery life seems to be good as well went for 3 relatively long rides (music and intercom) and it didn't die. I am not aware of a way to check the state of charge. If you are looking for a good COMS system for the cheap at 40 bucks a unit these are a solid choice but if you want good music quality then consider other options.",

            "input": "First and foremost, this is not a paid review, promotional review, or anything of the sort. I am purely doing this review to let others know about this product along with many others out there that have gave a similar review. With that in mind let me tell you all about these sweet pair of headphones. These are my first \"noise cancelling\" headphones and I say it like that because they only really cancel some sounds, not all. Now I have tried on other headsets, such as Sony or Bose, but after further review I want something that was cheaper for the time being that were comfortable, have a long battery life, and crisp sound/good bass. After first turning them on I did have that initial sound that was crackling but after one song it went away, however I haven't had them long so if it is consist I'll add a edit later. Anyway, these are a fairly solid pair of wireless ANC headphones if your on a budget or don't care about brand recognition. TaoTronics have some fairly solid other products too but this is the only one I have truly tried out. Pros: Battery life, anything that I don't have to charge once a day and more life once a week is a major win in my book and on top of that the charge time is fairly quick as far as my experience as seen with it so far. Comfort, I can quickly tell that these won't hurt after several hours of wearing them. You might get some mild discomfort/ear sweat if you have them on and it's hot out but other then that nothing so far for me. Price, enough said. Cons: Not a recognized brand? Some people are seriously loyal to their brands and will buy any amount of money. ANC isn't as good as others but still works well enough. With that it is also worth mentioning that they will work good on trains or airplanes as long as you have something playing with it. You might still pick up some sounds but for the most part they are pretty solid.",

I replaced my modem and this turned into a nightmare for this damned speaker. I tried to add my M3 as a new speaker only for the app to say that line of speakers isn't supported. For the sake of the help for others, if you have a speaker set up and replace a router, here is the fix: Delete the app, do a hard reset of the speaker (nowhere in any documentation is this mentioned)- do this by pushing and holding the cog icon button by the power input on the back reinstall the start the speaker, reinstall the app and start from scratch. If you have a blip in power/internet this thing has to be hard reset, it isn't able to reconnect or attempt to reconnect, so it just makes an annoying chiming sound instead. Then you have to unplug it and replug it in. Somehow it cripples my Echo Dot. Whenever connected either directly with a 3.5mm jack or over the network, it disables the speaker no matter what I have the audio set to. This is advertised as an Alexa/Echo compatible speaker. It isn't . Lastly is that it has no battery. I know it didn't when I bought it, but because everything about this speaker sucks other than sound quality, I feel that this is a pretty shitty oversight. Seriously, if the sound quality were even slightly worse this thing would get a 1 star review. It is a shit network speaker.",

This book does give good detail of how the removal came to be and all the ones that were involved in it. It is very good on that standpoint. This should be required studies for all. It is a very bad period of our history that came at the same time the slave issue was being debated very much. It is hard to understand what people were thinking then but it was a very different time and hopefully we have progressed some in America. The reasons I only give it four stars is that much is quoted at length in this book. Much of it could have been summed up in a more concise way to make it more easily understandable. Some of it could have been left out too. Also I think more could have been devoted to the trail. The author seemed to start on good path with it but sort of broke it off suddenly.

A smaller bucket would take up less counter space as well. I always put an unbleached coffee filter in the bottom as it makes emptying into the outside compost much easier (nothing sticks to the bottom), but this bin is too large a diameter to fully cover with one.

Here's the problem, their return/refund policy was no where on the listing. I even looked again while on the phone with their customer service rep. Nope, not there. It would have really been helpful to know their return policy in advance to buying the item. Update: the seller \"Driver Mods\" kindly sent me a screen print of a pretty basic and non-helpful return policy. It pointed me to Amazon's return policy for Amazon fulfilled items. This was a third party seller and it does not apply. Driver Mods has a VERY specific return/refund policy.

I believe if people are going to buy a product there should be either multiple options to choose from or there should be one single product that each and every personal receives. It should not feel like you have reached into a mystery bag to see which one you get. That is not good service. I will keep what I have but I will not recommend the product.",

My only worry was that these would not hold strongly, but they are rock solid. The second I got them out of the bag they shipped in, I had to exert a decent amount of effort to separate them just by the small contact patched they had in shipping. Make no mistake, the effort is a pro, not a con. Unfortunately it is stronger than the adhesive it comes with and after trying on multiple surfaces, I have determined it is not a sufficient adhesive for the strength of the loops. This is unfortunate because it otherwise is a great product. I don't intend to use the remainder of the roll, and unless the seller reaches out to resolve, I'll just consider it a $12 loss and move on to a different cable management solution.",

That wasn’t a success by any means – I rated it 2,5 stars, and while I had high hopes for a reverse harem set in a witching academy, my hopes fell flat and the book was a bit of a dissapointment. Still, I picked up book two, As You Witch, because I wanted to see if it would get any better. The series has a lot of potential, it just never executes it well, so I thought that maybe some of those kinks would’ve gotten fixed in book two. Alas, no such luck, and I even liked this one less than the first one. This book was filled with unnecessary drama from the start until the end. With a million possible options to pick villains when your book is set in a witching world, the author keeps on using the mean girl as a villain. It’s dull and predictable. The dialogue is so bad that I had to roll my eyes at every other sentence. Max is immature, childish, entitled, and the guys she’s supposedly in love with are so bland and boring even I wouldn’t be able to keep them apart. There is no conflict. There’s nothing really at stake. The relationships are too perfect – these four guys are instantly OK with all of them being with the heroine, and none of them is trying to win her for themselves. Of the four guys, only two have a hint of a personality, and the other two are basically just thrown in so this would be a reverse harem and not a love triangle. Either give them more personality or focus on the two that do have developed personalities and that a reader can root for. Look, I know I’m one of the few who isn’t fond of this series, and it has really high overall ratings on Goodreads and Amazon. So, don’t take my word for it, this is after all just my opinion. But as far as reverse harems go, I’ve seen a lot better than this one.",

I deducted one star because they should be able to update this design to accomodate a 180 degree rotation (or offer two versions), instead of me having to disassemble and rotate the plug myself.

For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing.

If I need more clips I order these: Pro Touch Assorted Hot Roller Clips, 12 Count. I half way dry my hair and then use the rollers. If it gets too dry I spritz with water. Then I use the blow dryer to dry each roller. I put on my makeup, get dressed and then they are dry and I take them out and have firm, long lasting curls. BTW, i do use gel on my wet hair.

            "input": "I purchased this back in late 2016. So at current date it's about 20 months old (give or take). The machine has worked beautifully for about the first year. I use it, on average 2 or 3 times a week to blend smoothies. So mostly cutting up fruits and ice together along with other semi-liquids - peanut butter, etc. So not a significant chore and I'll say the blender cruises through the material today as good as it did during day one. A couple things I'll point out at this point that keep me from being above 3 stars. The pitcher is not scratch resistant. This is relevant to cleaning. If you use an abrasive cleaning utensil (rough side of a sponge, etc.) it will leave the glass looking foggy. Not a huge deal, but certainly makes an otherwise new pitcher look aged quickly. I used the dishwasher for the pitcher, blades, and top 90% of the time. This may be counter to what the manufacturer recommends, but for real life, I just don't think it reasonable not to use a dishwasher on a pitcher for an appliance. The bigger problem with the machine has been the durability of the pitcher and associated lid / latching mechanism. Over the past number of months I noticed the black outer part of the handle on the pitcher was coming apart from the clear acrylic portion of the underside of the handle. I figured it wasn't a big deal, just kind of annoying. Perhaps it's due to the multiple dishwasher cycles (hot water / heated dry) - I'm not sure. This became a real problem recently when the part separated enough that the lit would not fit down properly to engaged the safety switch that runs up the handle due to the handle separating. Instead the two plastic pieces (the lid latch and the separated handle) came into contact, preventing the lid latch from making contact with the lock mechanism that runs up through the handle. I was surprised/disappointed to find that this year warranty is expired (and I've seen numerous reports that the pitcher isn't covered anyway, completely) and the cost of a new pitcher is within about $10 of what I paid almost 2 years ago for the entire unit. I think I'll be more discriminating in the next blender I buy, and not sure I'd trust in Ninja for the next purchase. When dropping the kind of money they expect for these, I'd hope for at least 3-5 years of usability. In full disclosure I didn't call the company to complain or ask for a new lid. I may later, but for now I made a temporary fix myself that will get me through for a little while longer I hope. This entailed very intensive craftsmanship made up of zip ties to bind the handle back together and a dremel tool to zip off the hanging lip of the lid latch to prevent it from hitting the handle. (Even with the handle zip tied together, I couldn't get enough pressure to prevent contact). I've attached pictures to indicate what the issue was and my rudimentary (but effective, for now) patch job.",

Same fire 7, but I believe a newer generation than even the 5th that we had and in a few months those ports as well became loose. The only way to charge these tablets is to wrap the charging cord around the tablets tight so that the port and cable are being pulled up over the tablet and held in place.

You wonder if it was his business partner and fiancee but are never told. She thinks that she loves her neighbor Kirk who is a doctor where she works.

It took my husband and I about 4 hours to put this together. The nails included don't work too well (very tiny, being a bit sharper would have helped), we had to hammer unbelievably hard to get the nails to go into the wood to attach the back to the unit and the bottoms to the drawers. There are a few places where the screw holes in one piece did not line up with the edge of the connected piece, which resulted in the screw cracking the wood and coming through the wood. We will need to cover these spots with tape so we don't cut ourselves on the screws when digging around in the drawers- this is why one star was taken off: poor planning on screw hole locations. I was tempted to rate it only 3 stars due to how difficult it was to put together, but it seems sturdy, and it's also real wood instead of particle board. It seems like it will last awhile.

I ended up putting it in from the inside, and was able to tighten up the plastic nut enough to hold the handle assembly securely. The handle on the old, stock unit, which lasted 15 years, was made of pot-metal, and the little pocket that the lever fits into had split open at the pressure/wear point. The new handle is made of plastic, with a slightly different cam mechanism. I would bet that it won't last nearly as long...time will tell.

But less than a month after using the carrier, the whole back tire piece fell off the carrier in transit to pick up the bike. Have no visual of the carrier when It is attached to the receiver on the back of my RV. Since the back tire part is the most lightweight piece of the carrier did not notice exactly when that piece fell off. Swagman, required me to provide pictures of the carrier. I attached a pic of the carrier assembled on the rack as well as all the parts for the second bike carrier that were still in the box. Stated in the form at Swagman.net that the parts for the second back tire part of the carrier were missing in the original shipment. Swagman sent me ONLY the back tire well but not the belt and buckle. When I called about that the woman was very curt over the phone. The strap and the buckle were sent but no directions on how to attach the strap to the tire well. In the assembly directions on Swagman.net there is no mention of attaching that part. A tech staff at Swagman told me that in the original shipment the belt and buckle are already attached to the tire well. When I asked if that part could be shipped assembled he said that wasn't possible. Googled you tube for directions without success. Basically I have a non-working carrier and the manufacturer doesn't seem to care that there's a major blip in providing good customer service. Unfortunately, there is no other bike carrier that is rated for transport for the back of an RV. But I cannot recommend this carrier due to the issue with pieces falling off the carrier when moving the trailer to pick up the bike.",

Then I remember another reviewer said you have to turn the barrel as you go down the hair, so that's what I did. I sort of kept wrapping it as I was sliding it through my hair. One important thing is to make sure that little lip on the wand is the side that is close to your scalp. I forgot that part and accidentally singed my forehead, I hope the burn isn't too bad! Anyway, so here is a picture I took. This literally took me like 5 minutes on dirty hair. All I did was brush out my hair and pop in a few curls, VERY pleased with how easy it is. It does sort of pull on your hair a bit, but I'm sure I will get better with that in time.

The reason for my low rating is that I’m normally not sensitive to smells, but there is a hint of something extremely strong in smell that my nose does not approve of. It reminds me of the smell when certain fruits start to rot and there is a very noticeable scent. The smell has bothered me every time that I have used the cleanser.",

In fact, there is a moment when the heroine finally has enough and I thought: \"good, now she'll go find someone who turns her on\". Not the emotional reaction the author intended, I'm guessing... I was also annoyed by the fact that the Hero had a girlfriend he neglected for most of the book -- not a good omen. And there were a number of things that should have been addressed a bit more thoroughly: how the heroine was going to deal with Nick's mother, the grandmother's behavior towards the heroine, etc. Add to all that the fact that it went on and on with nothing happening and no real psychological step forward, and it was a bore of a book.

However, in the small enclosed package that has the jumper wires is a sheet that shows Terminals 1 and 5 to be connected and also Terminals 2 and 3. The problem is the supplied jumper wires are too short and those latter connections are impossible to make. It's a little confusing that there are two different jumper connection shown in the paperwork with the product. I went with the one that the wires were long enough to actually work with. In practice I suspect it doesn't matter. Beyond that confusion, the rest of the install was straight forward. Programming is pretty easy, the display however is rather small and you have to look at it closely. Doubling the size of the LCD would be nice ! The buttons were not as smooth as they could be. Sometimes a light press resulted in nothing happening and it was necessary to press rather firmly to get the display to change as expected. But once the setup is done, these don't have to be touched again unless the program needs to be altered. It is very easy to bring the water heater on out of cycle by just pushing the large button that is accessible without opening the timer door.

This is not a litrpg book anymore, it is a romance novel, a poorly written romance novel. The grinding for levels is boring and lacks interesting detail. Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly. I am extremely disappointed with how this series turned out. This book was not worth the price tag. I will not be buying the next book because 3 books have been written in a similar manner now. It is repetitive and boring.",

I have unfortunately had to interact with Gigabyte's support/RMA process all for a fan on the cooler block that has an internal defect causing it to make a grinding noise constantly. This started happening within days of receiving and installing the card. First, to get to the RMA, you have at minimum two accounts to create and tickets to submit, one for tech support, another for RMA. Then they will ask you to send in the entire card for what could be a fairly simple swap of a fan, rather than just sending the fan. They will also drop the ball on communication, so you will have to hound them for answers. At this point I expect to replace the fan on my own dime. In short, despite the fan issue, this card has been pretty reliable for being so easily OC-able and I would probably choose this model over what else is available out there right now, unless I planned on setting up a custom water cooling setup.

Also sometimes if he's getting fussy while biting it, I'll take it and just gently brush his gums with the end and he loves it, sometimes he laughs haha.

I noticed that it takes a lot of time to evenly spread the product throughout your hair, and it caused my hair to become tangled and frizzy. Because I have dark brown hair, I had to put several layers of product on, and even after brushing it out, my hair was very stiff and uncomfortable. I feel like this looks cool for pictures or from a distance, but in reality it is stiff and uncomfortable to wear in public. I’m giving it 3 stars because the color actually came out vibrant through my dark hair, but again it was stiff and thick feeling. Also one thing that really bothered me was that it easily rubs off on your skin and clothes and never fully dries! It left pinkish stains all over the back of my neck and shirt. I feel like this was a good invention, but needs some improvement.",

I suggest getting a waterproof cover if you get this for a puppy. Otherwise, put the foam inside a trash bag and tape the opening close to keep moisture from reaching the foam. So far it's helped decrease the amount I've had to wash the foam pad. And the cover still fits over the trash bag covered foam pad without issue.

It is thin, but so much so that it actually feels a bit cheap, bends super easy thin, and doesn't really have the hard/more-sturdy/secure feel like I was expecting. Also, received an email from the seller thereafter that was advising to be careful removing it from the packaging it came in, so as to not scratch it. Makes one wonder if it's so fragile that taking it out of the company's packaging could damage, how much would it hold up in real life? Anyway, looks nice, super thin if that's what you're looking for, and not super expensive.

If a silk pillowcase sags a lot, it can tend to wrinkle at night especially if you sleep on your side or stomach, and/or if you’re a hot sleeper. So it kinda defeats the purpose of getting a silk pillowcase if you’re going to end up with a crease across your cheek, although it’s less of a problem if you sleep on your back; you’ll just notice the wrinkles on the pillowcase in the morning and it’s more disappointing rather than presenting a real functionality problem. Anyway, if you have super overstuffed pillows somehow, maybe these will work better for you.

Bass and treble are not linear, which could be ok for music but not for a movie when you need to listen to the voices.",

It still moves and will come off through the night sometimes but will usually make it to the morning. As far as the actual product, it is very soft. The velcro strap is wide enough that the mask keeps its shape and it is soft enough that makes it very comfortable on your head. I will add that it does not grab hair either, well at least mine not sure with someone that has long hair. The concave covering over the eyes is great. If you are on your back, you don't feel anything touching your eye. For the side sleeper, it is very flexible and soft that it is also comfortable when you got your face buried in the pillow. I didn't buy this for blackout feature of light but it does work pretty good. I did take a nap in the middle of the day last week and no light came through. The nose cut out helps with this compared to other masks. I purchased this to protect my right eye. I developed a lazy eye lid that opens on it's own when I sleep and being a side / stomach sleeper, this causes the sheets to scratch my eye and then for days I look like I have pink eye and it is scratchy and irritated. This mask has eliminated that problem and since I have been wearing it, my eye has been in great shape. I didn't give this review 4 stars because it still isn't \"perfect\" for side / stomach sleepers and honestly I don't think I will ever find one, but this one is the best I have tried so far.",

It took about a week to train the cat to use it, but she has no issues with it and the other cat is constantly disappointed that the lid is closed. One note, though. It says that you can program how long the lid stays open after the cat leaves. In fact, there is just a 3 position switch.

The chair is not your typical rocking chair meaning it doesn't have a full range of motion when rocking but I understood that when purchasing it. The chair looks nice and seems quality/durable. My only complaint and this is not related to the chair itself but has to do with UPS. Amazon uses UPS to deliver this item and I unfortunately only got 1 of the two chairs that I ordered. So now I have to wait for an investigation to be done as to where my other chair is before Amazon will replace the lost one. To me, it's bullshit given the amount of money paid for this item and my lengthy order history/money spent/ prime membership longevity. Also if you call UPS, they are of zero assistance and hardly speak English so you get no where with that either. Needless to say, I'm not happy. We live in FL so our nice/sitting outdoor weather is coming and I would have liked to have had this item and not be going back in forth in phone calls between Amazon and UPS.

I haven't noticed anyone else mentioning this, so perhaps it is just my set, but considering that they are LEDs, the lack of any brightness was very disappointing.

But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \"dust\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty. Sometimes it's nice to just splurge.",

My large den is mostly lit by the neon signs I've purchased to adorn my man cave, with other lamps near the walls that sit on end tables and such. But I needed one light to hang over the arm of my couch with remote operation to give my immediate area some brightness at a touch, whether it be for reading or whatever. The lamp came in a deceptively small, but stout box. It assembled in moments, and was no problem to twist its light so that it hung directly over my shoulder and gave me the light I was needing. Its plenty bright to read by, or construct models, or whatever I can imagine I'd need. And the ability to adjust the light from a warm glow to a cool white is a nice touch. If I had any complaint, it would be the remote. Where still smaller than most other remotes I own, I don't think it warrants the need for five presets and AA batteries (not included). It's just a minor gripe that I thought I'd add on an otherwise perfect fit for what I was needing. A smaller remote that used AAA batteries and a smaller inventory of face buttons just seems much more feasible for such a simple device. For example, there is a button for \"breastfeeding\" that is indicated by the picture of a milk bottle. Ummm... okay then. But at any rate, great product!

In that situation, I have to hold the phone in my hand at chest height for the headphones to work properly. The other gripe that I have is that the plastic piece that goes behind the neck is one piece and is too small for me. This causes the headphones to be pulled out at an angle when I wear them.

This leaves out my new Eero mesh network, and would have also failed on my prior non-mesh network because it too used the same SID for 2.4 & 5ghz. After reading some of the other complaints by reviewers, it appears that AirMega may be knowingly selling a wifi connected air purifier that does not work on modern common place wifi networks. The published suggested solution of slowing down your entire wifi network by disabling 5ghz is not a viable solution or a workaround in my book. Also, one smaller point is that the air purifier has 4 speed settings. The top two settings are very loud.

It takes multiple attempts to turn the phone off/on. Terrible design. In fact other than being a nice looking case this thing is subpar and poorly designed. I really don't understand all the good reviews here. Finally, these type case should be designed to have the phone in a magnetic removable case. Talking on the phone requires folding the case open on this thing and that would be eliminated with the removable case or at least give you the option if you wanted to. Once again the removable magnetic case kills it. That is extremely convienient and something that Dreem came up with and has since been copied by other companies. I definately would not recommend this case. I am waiting for Dreem to come out with the xs max version so I can dump this pig.",

My criteria was it had to have a trolley sleeve, be stylish and versatile enough to bring to the beach, roomy enough to fit my travel pillow, accessories, food and change of clothes, and zippered so my stuff doesn’t fall out. This met all the criteria and I also loved that it has a flat bottom and is easy to clean, because I will be stowing this under the seat in front of me and we all know how disgustingly dirty planes are. The trolley sleeve keeps the bag together with the main bag more securely, so I can’t wait to try this out. Some reviews have said it doesn’t fit over the handle, but this is not a problem with my Eagle Creek roller bag. The only thing I think I would change are the handles, because they are kind of thin and may hurt if carrying heavier stuff as a tote, but I can deal with it and my solution would be to slip on some padded sleeves on the handle.",

I was always afraid to use them because I didn’t know how easy it would be to get them off. I decided to get one because this is just too expensive to have a simple film. It was fairly easy to put on, but getting the dust off is a pain. That’s not a detractor for this protector, though. The reason I’m only giving this four stars is because I think tempered glass screen protectors are a gimmick after my first experience with them. I think it’s lovely that they give you to just in case one breaks or you make a mistake. However, because I didn’t make a mistake, I took off the first one and put on the second. In doing so, the first one slid off the couch and fell to the tile at a distance of about 2 feet. When I say it fell, I actually mean it gently glided down to the floor. When I went to clean up the mess from all of the paper, plastic, and cleaning supplies, I noticed that the first screen protector was completely shattered. There are many reviews saying that this screen protector saves the device, prevented it from shattering, etc. I don’t buy it. If it shattered from a height of 2 feet, then it really seems unnecessary for the purpose of protecting your screen from shattering. It will definitely protect against scratches, but that is the only reason that I would purchase this.",

Too awkward to use there. 3. The water bottle pocket needs to be bigger. I had a 20 oz bottle which barely fit. I had to work some to get it in. The things I did like: 1. Nice size not too little not too big. Holds what you need for an outing. I had a fold up umbrella, sunglasses and case and a few other smaller items in it for the day. Could even fold up a jacket to fit. 2. Nice to have hands free and able to access without taking it off like a backpack. 3. It is comfortable.

With that being said, it does a really good job of actually epilating. My leg hairs grow quickly, so I have to epilate once every 2 weeks. This has been an okay first epilator, but honestly if I could send this one back I would. I will probably buy one in the future that will work while it's plugged in so I don't have to wait in between charges to use it.

The bigger issue is that the blades aren’t nearly as sharp as they should be. Like I said, I only have 6 small bushes, so it’s not like I’m trying to saw off tree limbs — this should easily handle a job like mine, but sometimes it takes a lot more effort than it should to cut through.

Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together. It was necessary to slightly wiggle and twist the track when pushing it together so the small metal clips engaged with the metal part of the track. In several cased I had to use the tip of a knife to lift the metal clip up into place while pushing everything together.",

The exhaust on the sides it really intense and might blow the dust away before you have a chance to vacuum it up.

It's not like I overused the headphones, either. Since my purchase 12 months ago I estimate I have used them fewer than 50 times. Compared to people who practically live with buds in their ears, that's nothing. I don't expect miracles, but I do expect more from a product like this. I won't purchase another product from this company any time soon.",

The top is a vibrant, bright pink, and the bottoms are white with specs of the same bright pink as well as other bright colors that compliment the top. My favorite thing about this swimsuit is that the top has scallops on the bottom of it which I did not notice when ordering initially. Now, the reason for my three star rating...the cup shaped padding in the top doesn't stay in place, therefore leaving your nipples exposed if the swimsuit is wet. I am not rating the suit on support since I didn't buy it with the intention of it being supportive. I'm blessed up top and do not expect for something with zero underwire to hold me up. The straps do help keep me from falling out of the top though which was one of the reasons I picked it. The bottoms are too big for me but that's only because I have to go up in size for the top to fit, so I really cannot say anything other than they're extremely cute and look like they would be flattering since they're a high waisted fit. (Note: I would have given the swimsuit a lower rating, but I feel like that may be a little premature seeing as how I've had it for less than a week. I will drop a star in my rating if the suit doesn't hold up through the end of summer.)",

The top of my unit got wet because of rain. The horn button seems fairly water-tight, but the top of the main unit's housing is another story. After 14 hours of drying-out there is still condensation inside the clear plastic covering of the solar panel. Also, horn electronics have shorted -- horn goes off randomly when plugged in or just produces an anemic chirp. There is also water leaking from the horn jack receptacle which entered through the solar panel cover. Leaving the unit in the sun all day doesn't recharge batteries, so I'm thinking the solar feature is more of a gimmick than anything useful. As a guesstimate, using the light with full-beam about 1 to 1.5 hours a week (with very liberal use of the horn whenever riding) requires the unit to be charged once every 2 weeks. A red light flashes when batteries are running low. Charging takes about 6 - 8 hours. As another nitpick, it's really annoying to cycle through 4 light modes just to turn the unit off. Depending on your riding style, the horn button clasp may be prone to slip when you press it. The horn clasp is a rubber band-like and not a bolt. Since most horn-light combos are like this, I wouldn't deduct points for this. Just something to be aware of. Overall it's a good light, but it's not rainproof or waterproof. And the solar panel feature is possibly a sales gimmick. If you decide to purchase, don't allow it to get wet!",

Bottom line- if you want this as a very inexpensive alternative to a Fitbit and aren’t worried about it being easy to read texts, then this is the device for you. I really just wanted something to track my steps because it’s easier to wear this than carry my phone everywhere. The difficulty of removing the bands though is pretty tough for me to get past and I don’t look forward to having to do it again.

The two vents in the center are for the gas furnace and the tiny pipe in the lower left of the picture is the generator exhaust pipe.

When we pulled the wire ends off the switch the whole tab came out, it did this for everyone I tried to pull wire end out and it broke the switch when I tried to put it back in. Junk. Do no order this product you will not be happy. I was ready for install and now out of return window so I am not very happy. I hooked up with my local automotive wiring shop and he told me the problem. It seems on the wire ends you have to squeeze the tab on the wire end and force it out of the lock then the wire ends comes off easy. Its a shame, since I did ruin two switches and pulled the ends out of three others. I would now order this item again with the knowledge of how to use it. It seems the seller would have told us this in the literature/instructions. I am adjusting my rating to 3. Write better instructions it hurts your product!!",

Ah, \"the sounds of silence\"! It's a quality, sturdy product and being able to recharge it rather than buying batteries was a big plus for me. Two observations I'd like to share: (1) one reviewer remarked that the unit was too big for her small dog. Emmy is petite and 22 pounds, and the unit is a bit overwhelming on her neck, too. (2) The unit went off once when Abe shook his head, and once when another dog standing near him barked. Changing the sensitivity eliminated the unit going off when he shakes his head, but not when a nearby dog barks. All in all, this was money well spent!",

The video of the guy easily breaking into the safe is a bit misleading; however there is an access \"key slot\" under the Stanley plate. If you're that worried about someone breaking in I suggest a bigger safe and a change of location haha. I added two motion sensor lights to the inside which really makes a huge difference. The door had a little play in it when closed, a thin foam tape fixed that. I also read a review about finger print issues; if you dont reset the safe before entering prints then any print will work, says so in the manual. Do a proper setup and it works great. If your worried about speed of access I suggest logging your middle finger as well, you can then hit the key and read your print in one motion thia is also much more comfortable. Another thing is log your finger in several positions for easy access. Somehow I was able to disable the open door alarm which I was happy about. I intend to mount this inside a large gun safe so the fact that it is not fireproof is less of an issue to me otherwise that would be the only downside. Highly recommend this safe.",

The speaker has good insulation from dust and water, providing some needed features that other high end speakers don’t have. Build: In my testing the speaker held out really well. I took it to camp to test out the durability. This speaker held out really well. The front amps get very loud when paired by Bluetooth. In my case I used an iPhone XS. In my case i used the speaker while I was outside By the campfire. Battery: I tested the battery nonstop and noticed that I got easily 6-8 hours on constant use. In my defense my phone didn’t last as long thus battery life is very subjective to the loudness and if Bluetooth is use. I mostly connected the device via Bluetooth. Features: The main features that this speaker has are the micro sd card slot, and microphone built in. I used the speaker for offline use by transmitting music via bluetooth. Because I was camping the service in my area was fairly poor, thus just adding my whole music library to the micro sd or usb is very convenient.",

It makes the mixture leave a layer of mix against the bowl, never to be touched by the mixing tools. So it HAS to be turned off and sides scraped, multiple times during use.

It is low and it tends to push your breast toward the center which causes a bulge. I like the back support and I think it will be more comfortable after I get used to it. Will wear for a week before deciding if I will keep it. Update: after wearing it for a few days I have concluded this bra is great for small busted women....however, full figure women might find the front coverage not adequate.

PYLE rates these speaker mounts up to 110 lbs (from PYLE's website) - I would think this would warrant quality assurances around the type of screw they are including in the installation kit.

They come in a compact box because the cabinets are actually made up of three rectangular shaped units. That helps to make them fairly strong once they are put together with the back panels. I have been putting together press board furniture for 30+ years and have seen the parts quality and chip board quality decrease. This is about as low in quality as I have seen yet, but it still works to suit a purpose. There is a faint chemical smell from these. The best way I have to put these together is to put the top box together first on a carpeted floor, square up the box and attach the back panel, then attach the second box, square it up again and attache the back panel, etc. I used some glue I had around for strength. The dowel pins are small. I have never seen them that thin before, but again they do the job. I bought two and have only put together the first one so far. The only thing I will do differently with the second one is to use small finish nails instead of the easily bendable things they provide. They should have provided plastic covers for the cams, but once the cabinets are loaded they are not visible. There are small holes in the top panel to secure the cabinet to the wall. I would have preferred that they not leave holes in there. Once fully put together the cabinets look decent and are fairly sturdy. They are just the right size to have six rows of DVDs or Blu Rays. The main reason I got these is because they fit in very small spaces and I needed extra storage. If I was looking for something more permanent, I definitely would look at other products. As it is these should be viewed as cheap and disposable but good for the purpose they are made for. I had thought about using two cabinets and building them so they are five boxes high instead of three. May still try that, and if I do it would be necessary to anchor them to a wall. The back panels are not really configured to do that because their interlocking \"jigsaw\" pattern is specific to three boxes, but it may be worth a try to save floor space. A wall of these things could look pretty cool and would be functional.",

Needed new phones (Ours were quite old) so I looked for an affordable alternative. These looked like a good deal, so I went for it. A few things to keep in mind... 1) One of my phones was new. The other had a SIM card in it, all of the protective plastic removed, and was obviously used. No damage, but I paid for an advertised \"Brand New Phone\" and am not happy that this one is used. 2) All of the embedded MetroPCS apps are there, but if you are not on Metro none of them work. I have disabled all of the apps I could, but you can't shut them all down, and you may want to use some. I don't have find my phone, for example, and there is no \"voice mail\" icon to indicate when you have a voicemail and your only access to voicemail is to dial the \"1\" on the key pad. 3) The playback volume for media is not very loud- my wife uses hers to watch videos off her facebook feed, and you can barely hear them even with the volume all the way up. Overall, I like the phone. Had I known it would be used and would lack some of the features I wanted because although it is unlocked it is still a Metro phone, I would have made a different decision. You might decide differently, but at least you know more than \"ITs a great phone and works with AT&T\" which is all the information I had to work with.",

But what isn't acceptable is having to force some of the screws in because the drilled holes don't match up. I don't mean they're a little off-center. They just don't match up at all. The top piece and the bottom piece are meant to be screwed together but ot was so hard to get in there to drill a new hole out I had to so it by hand. There's not much space to move and get a grip so the screws ended up going in as much as they could but the two pieces are still relatively loose. There's a gap between the two pieces. I don't recommend this to anyone at all. Only reason I kept it is because I'm not going to be moving it a lot so as long as I don't move it, it'll be fine. I also didn't want to go through the return process and disassembling the rack then trying to make it all fit back in the box the way it came.",

OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different.

I used this on my front fender that has a prior body shop repair that failed. they used some steel mesh and and epoxy to re-attach the quarter panel mounting strap to the body. After years of driving I hit a parking bumper that pushed the bumper back and popped the epoxy. I attempted to use the existing metal mesh and this to fix it, However I slightly scrapped going through a dip in the road and the slight pressure caused this epoxy to release as well. Trust me, I used A LOT of this epoxy on that joint! The plunger being deceptive. You HAVE to push down on the DEAD CENTER of the plunger to get it to dispense evenly.

I was skeptical because when I opened the package and looked at the bulbs, I could not find a photo sensor … so I expected these to stay on all the time, contrary to the claim. But, even though I couldn't find the photo sensor, it must be there. These do indeed turn on at night and off in the morning. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were described as \"cool white\". I'd describe them as \"blue-white\". (I'll take some of the blame for this, though, because the description did say 6000K, and I didn't pay enough attention to that. I wish I'd gotten the 3000K version.)

I can't take the dog for a walk with them. This I think is more the technology than the product. I have issues some times using other bluetooth headphones while outside. I also had one of them go into some kind of fault and would not turn off (a particular issue with these I've had, could be my big fingers). There was a buzzing noise and no music. I let the battery die (which seemed to take longer than when in use) and after recharging have worked fine. The battery life seems poor. On more than one occasion I believe they were fully charged and they died after a short time. I did expect more from these based on my previous experience, and I am disappointed in them. I would not recommend these and I'm not sure I would trust this company to buy other products. In doors in the office or at home they work fine.

The video feed looks a little stretched on a Samsung Galaxy S7 but it connects without problems.

First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the \"peep,\" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.",

It's possible that might be problematic if you're trying to use a light refill ink (say, yellow) on a stamp that had dark ink in it (say, black). But I'm replacing all of the colors with red, blue and green, so it's not a problem. Search Amazon for \"rubber stamp refill ink.\" Apply a few drops, press the stamp a few times to get the excess ink out, and you're good to go.",

I still kept some hope, because maybe the fur was in a sealed bag?? It was not, the bag was open ended and filled with water.

At first when installing.. only 1 row on one worked, and both on the other.. the 1 with one row had a pin not connecting nicely (ground).. that was easily bent into a better position and fixed. I taped the connector once over with electrical tape, then used a flat head (with some struggling) to push the connectors deeper into the mirror one at a time. Making sure the lights are working I pushed the lens into the mirror, they DID NOT snap tight.. if I slightly pushed it they'd come out.. this was a no go.. what is happening is the latch on the LED lens is not seating itself.. so what I did is pushed it in all the way, and then on the mirror side (with mirror turned up and away) I used my flat head and forced the latch to seat itself (it takes some force, it won't break the latch) and once it's seated.. the lens isn't going ANYWHERE, highway, bumps or not.. so far so good.

It is pretty and sexy, which is hard to find in a body shaper. It also breathes, unlike other body shapers where I am uncomfortable. It also does a great job of staying up around the waist and not rolling down- again very comfortable. I also like how the butt area isn't super tight, where other body shapers leave a very noticeable underwear line. The butt area is also very comfortable; it doesn't ride up or pinch. I wish that this sucked in the stomach area a little more, but it offers great support and smooths the stomach area. The shipping was timely, and I have had no issues with the product. It has held up nicely after 3 washings. I am very happy overall.",

The multitude of interior pockets are unnecessary and just added weight if you use a wallet with the backpack. The external water bottle pocket is useless if your are right handed. I used the backpack over my left shoulder so I could slide it around to my right side without taking it off and access the contents with my right hand. This leaves a water bottle \"dangling\" in the water bottle holder. Even when wearing the pack on my back, the water bottle is \"dangling\" and falls out. The first time I used it with my Thermos water bottle, it dropped out and dented the bottle and broke the lid, so it was not available for the rest of the trip. Even plastic disposable water bottles fell out. The bag either needs water bottle holders on both sides so that at least one is usable, or better yet, an elastic anchor strap to securely hold water bottle in place. The external water bottle pouch was the one thing that sold me on this daypack, yet it proved to be almost useless when I used it for real world activities..

I will warn you that the holder is translucent and is already attached to one of the pacifiers. I didn’t realize this and thought I threw it away. It’s easy to take off and more to another one.

Also, the photo shows the shoulders strap at their full length, which is unrealistic. When adjusted, the straps hang down in a way that, again, makes perfect sense, but as I bought this for a costume, surprised me when I put it on. Finally, as I began to adjust the straps, I could already see that the teeth that hold the straps in place where starting to fray the straps themselves, under normal use. overall.

I expected more from this seeing that it's a bit more pricey. SEALING LID: NICE that it can be disassembled for thorough washing. BAD because Close/Open indicators are hard to read (grayish silver against black). Also hard to see if it is open or close because the movable closing mechanism inside is same color as lid. If you don't have your glasses to read the hard-to-read indicators, you have to make sure to tip it a bit to check if it's closed.

I agree with a couple other reviewers that motor QC is not great - one motor came with a slightly bent shaft - visible when turning the prop and enough to cause slight vibration on the fpv cam.

First, although the stainless insert is actually pretty good, it's a bit of a stretch to say it can take 3 cups of uncooked rice. 2 is about the true maximum. OIt doesn't cook all that well either compared to the one this was purchased to replace. Second, the whole outer unit is no better than those ultra-cheap ones which show up at discount stores around Christmas for 8 bucks--definitely not of a quality matching the fairly-high by comparison asking price. I also bought the steamer basket and that is extremely cheaply made. Very thin metal and junky plastic handles--not even close to the quality of the stainless insert pot in the cooker itself. Feels like a dollar-store level item. I gave it 2 stars because it does cook rice...so it does the job (not all that well). However, this isn't anywhere near worth the asking price when compared to other offerings available. Keep looking--you can do far better for the same money.",

His book provides excellent insights into the challenges and problems of ordinary people like you and me who are struggling to make sense of the world and to cope with its incidents and trials. That's the first aspect. The second aspect are his plans and procedures which lead to the formulation of effective attitudes and values. This is where the book is so valuable. It opens up a path of hope for people who want their lives to improve and to have meaning. The rules Jordon Peterson outlines make perfect sense once he has finished explaining them - in fact many readers will wonder why they didn't previously see what was staring them in the face. These rules are particularly helpful to young men and women commencing their adult lives. These rules clarify what may have only been perceived dimly or not at all. While reading this book I felt that I as a fallible human being was being reached out by another human being who understands the potential of any of us to make poor decisions as well as good ones. The many incidents that Jordan Peterson describes in his book by way of illustration bring a very human dimension to his work. If you have older children or grandchildren buy a copy of this book for them. You will give them a true investment in their future.",

When I realized in the morning that it hadn’t synced, I tried looking for a signal manually (a few times, too!), but no luck with that either. These methods had previously worked for another Marathon model (slim jumbo wall clock), when it took around 30 minutes to sync (again, after some manual intervention). I’m in the Bay Area, if it helps. Anyway, after all attempts at automatic and manual syncing failed, I was forced to program the clock manually — the process was a bit tedious, if you ask me. Bought it in the white & gold, and it looks and works fine otherwise — as a regular digital desk clock, I mean, just not as an atomic one. And since it was rather cheap, I won’t complain *too* much. I’m actually glad that it’s not constantly backlit (with a bright light), because why would I want my bedroom bathed in neon orange light all night when I’m trying to sleep?! The screen lights up for a few seconds at the touch of a button (on top), so when I do want to tell the time at night, it’s not that complicated a process at all. The numbers are large enough and easy for me to read. The clarity of the numbers does depend on the viewing angle, as some reviewers have mentioned. The size of the clock is appropriate for a desk/alarm clock, IMO. Haven’t used it as an alarm clock, so have no insight to offer in that regard. So, all said and done, my biggest, and *only* grievance is that its absolute *main*, *featured* functionality, is totally non-functional and useless. Now here’s hoping that in order to get my money’s worth, it at least lasts longer than a year! 🤞🏼",

Super large basket underneath Cons: Fairly long stroller, it does help to have the extra wheels to help with maneuvering. The wheels on the bag (attaches to the stand up board) is fairly load when strolling in sidewalks with cracks. It is very large folded up and you have to take the seats off (this makes it take up the entire truck area of our Ford Flex) Overall this is a great stroller for families with children that range in age.

I've used mine for approximately 4-5 months, and we're not talking excessively or roughly here, just to vacuum a small room and occasionally an area rug. About six weeks ago, the handle/cannister part started separating from the base while using it normally. It would just pop off and there was no way to secure it. I just had to push them back together and wait for them to pop apart again. Again, I was NOT slamming the vacuum around, the simple action of moving the vacuum back and forth (you know, vacuuming) would cause it to separate. Then yesterday, one corner piece of the base with one of the wheels just fell off while using it. A close look at it showed that one of the cheap plastic locking pieces that kept it in place had moved out of alignment. It is made to do this (lock and unlock). I went to put the corner piece back on and lock it into place. I applied a minimal amount of pressure to relock it and the locking piece snapped. Super high quality stuff here. I tried using heavy duty tape to secure the pieces back together and that worked fine, but now the brush no longer spins. So that's the last straw. This is going in the garbage and I will not be purchasing a Shark product ever again. I would highly recommend you avoid this one. see less",

The pacing is slow and light on action, but does make up for it in character development as well as some stunning scenery. The family mansion is to die for. The plot is filled with clichés about the nerdy high school girl who is bullied and yearns to be popular but is just to damn quirky to fit in including the stupid side kick who is loyal but likewise an outcast. However the thing that bothered me most was the not so subtle occult theme throughout the movie. In the end the girl ends up having essentially the power of a God and she is tasked with saving the planet from the evil scourge of humanity...oh and she's gonna birth the savior as well. I was confused as to whether she was gonna save the planet with her powers or usher in the savior as the prophecy foretold. Whatever, the movie abruptly ends with her declaring she wants to help after resurrecting and healing several friends who had just had an accident. I felt the acting was on par with the budget which wasn't much I'm guessing. Some decent actors who's careers are over and they just don't know it yet lol...There's a whole sequence in there about how evil humans are destroying the planet and global warming and such which was a turn off to me as well.

For example, the author tries to convey the best technique for sound programming in Python, but He goes off on a tangent and provided you with some other details of how not to program in Python. If you are a beginner, you will become lost, and won't be able to track back on some of these examples. At the end of the chapter, you will have to read it again in order to grasp a clearer understanding of how Python works.

They wouldn't be great for total sound blockage, but they're very nice for reducing ear fatigue in loud environments. Unfortunately, they are also rather small and easy to lose, especially since they're clear. The canister that they come in is a bit narrow, and it can be hard to fish the plugs out. Sometimes I use a car key, and I worry that it may look like I am about to perform some sort of illicit sniffing activity. This whole ordeal also led to me losing one of the plugs within a week or two of getting them-- it got dropped on the floor of a dark club while I was trying to fish it out of its canister. Whoops. They're also potentially easy to lose in your ear canal-- I find that the stems are a bit short, and I sometimes feel like I'm one misstep away from a very sticky situation.

Gameplay was choppy at best, seems there's a cutscene or a change of perspective every time you start to build any momentum. The health pack system made the play very frustrating - most levels are played something like: pop two shots, find cover, use health pack, repeat. Simply not very satisfying completing the campaign. Multiplayer is as bad as others have described. If you have someone else living with you who does not appreciate you yelling at the screen constantly, for their sake, do not buy this game. Laggy, inconsistent, and frustrating. As I mentioned earlier, I bought the game to play multiplayer with friends. The party system is an absolute mess. It's nearly impossible to play with friends. First, you have to change default settings to join parties at all, and if you're lucky enough to successfully create or join a party, you're likely to end up in entirely different games. I'd estimate I've successfully played the same match as my friends no more than 20% of the time.

My black and decker I got for 18 dollars is more ergonomic than this, even if they have a proprietary charger. Edit: I just used this on a jobsite all day and I have to say, the twisting didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, the led light is perfect, and although it doesn't take double sided bits I can forgive that as it chargers via usb.

The box says not to use while charging. I thought it was because of overheating, but it does not get hot at all. The tablet uses battery faster than it can charge, so that may be why. It takes at least 4 hours to fully charge. The thing that infuriates me the most, is the right shift key. It's different than the photos advertised, and is on the other side of the up arrow. I have small fingers so it's very hard to reach that key. On the plus side, it comes with a charger, but also can charge with a micro usb. It detaches easily from the keyboard, but stays on without problem if I need it to. Seems durable, but plastic screen has detached slightly already.

Third step was to add another phone on the USB-A smart port, which I did, and to my surprise the tablet stopped charging...I unplugged the usb-a the tablet started charging again...bottom line the USB-a ports can NOT be used with the usb-c charging port... Bottom line, if you want to buy this charger keep in mind you can only use 2 ports, or the 3 USB-A ports... Buying this for the usb-a ports is not worth the money, buying this for the usb-c and quick charge port, I guess its a good deal, hence the two stars... It also comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable which is great, others in this price and even higher, dont.

PROS Fits the tab perfectly Aids in lifting tab Convenient 'always on' Will reduce spillage CONS Will not contain carbonation Will not contain spillage Does not inspire confidence in opening can Possible injury to thumb when opening can All that said, some context is in order. Initially, I was looking for something to contain the carbonation for cans left in the fridge overnight, and reduce some slight uneasiness about nearby science projects easing death into my soft drinks. These looked very simple, and though pricey at eight USD, I appreciated the clever design. Ordered even though I realized these were not intended for my use case. The work very well for their intended use, and fairly well for mine, as noted above. There is only one caveat, for which I deducted one star. (I usually don't give the fifth star until I observe a high level of durability over time. That was not this case though.) The width of the two 'tines' that encircle the tab actually *impeded* opening the can. They press on the surface of the can that doesn't open. You're instructed to press on the tab with your thumb while pulling up on the back of the Barricade. On two cans my thumb went into the opening somewhat. There were no cuts, but I can see that as a possibility, unless maybe you have wide meaty digits. Using the device to try to open the can gave me the impression it could snap at any second. I found it much easier to open the tab as I always do, then attach the Barricade afterwards. For anybody who has trouble lifting the tab, using the Barricade to lift the tab up enough to grab it without the device might be a better way to go. Aside from the price, I'd recommend these for their intended purpose. I'll get full caps for overnight storage in the fridge, but I really like these guys for daily use. They work well enough for me and possibly better for others.",

It’s not a bitter taste but it’s certainly not a pleasant taste. Another thing I didn’t like is that each chew has 4 grams of carbs. I need 1500 mg of calcium per day due to Bariatric surgery, so I would be consuming 12 grams of carbs per day. I’m trying to follow a Keto way of eating and would prefer it not to have so many carbs just for a supplement. It has corn syrup and sugar, and then they added Splenda. I guess the aftertaste would be worse if those ingredients weren’t there. I do applaud them for avoiding aspartame. I do like the fact that they used calcium citrate instead of carbonate. I also like the fact that one chew is 500 mg. It has some Vitamin K2 in it as well which is good. I’ll continue to take these until I find a reasonable replacement.

THIS is valuable because it allows me to make an informed decision on how much of the oil is safe to use and not to use; because some oils for kids are considered unsafe (eucalyptus as an example) and by me seeing in the studies that the ppl or kids that had a negative reaction LIKELY orally consumed a large amount of it or was exposed to too high of a concentration.

I tried one when they first arrived, enjoyed it, but felt a bit yucky about 10 minutes afterwards. I tried another one a few days later, thinking the first time must have been a fluke, but it happened again--only worse. Needless to say it was no fluke, and I won't touch them again.

I totally recommand thia maby monitor. You can also have more than one camera set up but i didnt try it. No need for me Almost a year after purchase, i had a small issue with my parental monitor. Would charge properly. I wouldnt say this was a defective issue of the monitor but more a usage issue (Probably bb that keep pulling the cord). I contacted them. Their costumer service is amazing and also the people working for them. Same day responses to multiple emails and they were very helpful and very fast.

Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense.

The edges are much less rough at the end of the cut too. I docked one star because the saw is a little too flexible for harder woods, but it still is a great saw.",

The problem that I have found with every Yale folder that I have used is that you have to be perfect when you drop the paper in to be folded. Off just a tad and it folds with wrinkles. Sometimes fairly badly. There does not seem to be a way around it. If the unit had guides on the sides to perfectly align the drop in it would be fantastic. As it is, if the letters are personally addressed and you need it to be perfect, you will have a couple or do-overs. For the price, well worth it. Just be patient and careful.",

There are lots of modes to cycle through, from short and medium flashes to dim up, dim down to solid ON. It takes a minute to get used to holding down the button to turn it off, but once you've got that, the light \"remembers\" what mode it was in when you turned it off, and comes back to that mode when you turn it back on, which to me is exactly the right behavior.

I just purchased this and it already ripped after lifting the bag for the first time with my clothes in it. I read someone’s review about the same problem before purchasing and had my fingers crossed hoping it wouldn’t happen to me... but it did :/ On the bright side, however, I was able to fit an entire dresser full of clothes into this bag! I had to get rid of my dresser and make more space in my room ASAP and had to purchase something quickly. I only bought one at first because I wanted to make sure I liked the product and also to see how much I could actually fit before getting more. When I first received the bag, I did not like the quality. I wanted to return it but found out returns were not accepted for this item. So I had no choice but to give it a try, and to my surprise, was able to fit all the clothes from my large dresser. I definitely did not expect everything to fit! I thought I would have for sure needed at least two. Anyway, I was very happy with my purchase at that point and didn’t have any problems either, so I ended up purchasing another one even though the price had increased. That, of course, was a mistake as the plastic from second bag tore the moment I lifted it with my clothes to set it aside. I haven’t touched the first bag since I put my clothes in it but I’m pretty sure if I touch it again, it will rip. The bag definitely saves you a ton of space but I would suggest looking elsewhere for a similar product that is better quality. It is definitely worth it to spend a little extra for a stronger quality bag that will last longer. This particular item, on the other hand, is cheaply made and is not worth the price, unless the cost is less than $5. Yes, I was able to fit everything in the bag but what good does that do for me if the bag is ripped up? Keep in my mind the bag is lightweight only because it’s made from very cheap quality. I shouldn’t have purchased the second one but oh well... like I said, it’s okay for now until I find something better.",

You also have to take a lot of the air out from the inside so that you can see the screen better underwater.

I’ve also hung it over my bathroom towel rack, when needed, because my bathroom never has enough outlets. It really needs to have a spring loaded lever that is as wide as the unit itself. Currently the lever is about a half inch, which means it doesn’t touch anything I own other than my bookshelf, and therefore will not attach in a stable manner. (My counters aren’t wide enough to even touch the lever and my antique desks are too deep to slide it onto). The lever spring is very strong, however, but because it is so thin, the power strip moves position every time you touch it! Possibly having a wider lever and some flat wings with rubber grips on each side, of the top portion of the strip, would prevent this, at least some. The USB and C ports work perfectly and quicker than I expected them to. The LED indicator light on top is so dim, that I have a terrible time telling whether or not the strip is on! The only time I can visualize it is when it’s dark. And there is no labeling that tellers you which is which, either. At least not that I’ve seen (I’m visually impaired so this may just be me). Having so many places to plug in power cords and USB devices is extremely convenient and I love the concept! I love that the strip is at waist height and my cords are not all over the floor. If this design is improved, I’d eventually buy several more. Until then, however, it gets one of my lowest ratings. The seller doesn’t contact you back, the way they promise to, even after sending a direct email to my inbox, requesting that I contact them if dissatisfied. This is extremely frustrating. I’ll eventually rig the lever so that it covers more surface area and holds onto more items, but have yet to have the time. I hope that the developers/shippers, whichever, can look into this, and design this item with either a wider lever or other attachment options so that it can be more useful in more places and prevent it from moving with every touch.",

The included buckles are easy to use and grip the belts across the full surface which should prevent the belts from breaking down so quickly. There is just enough stretch to move with me without being too tight. The only downsides so far: The width of the belt, I believe, was described as 1.5\" which is almost too wide to fit into some of my belt loops.

This did not fix the pressure problem, just the cleanliness problem. However, I started using a thumbtack to clean the drip point in the metal cup that holds the coffee. This aha moment did not come from customer care but has taken care of the problem. Originally I had this at 5 stars for making great cappuccinos. Went down to 1 star when it stopped working more than 50% of the time. Bringing it up to 3 stars as the machine seems good, but the experience with Customer Care and having to figure out how to get it working right was not awesome. Original review: Good: When it works it makes great espresso and cappuccinos. It is easy to clean, although the sealed metal filters that came with the machine would retain water. Bad: After a 9 months the pressure was insufficient to get the double shot to go thru. No change in coffee brand. Ugly: Spoke with their customer care several times, and it seemed more like they wanted to get me not to submit a claim against the warranty than to help. Just because it made 1 cup 1 time, does not mean it wasn't failing 95% of the times. I still don't know what's wrong with the machine, if it is fixable or not, but now its outside of warranty.

In the pictures offered of this product, one shows it with an embossed \"Wet\" and another without. Also mine arrived with white nubs on the ends of the bristles, whereas one ad shows all black, while another shows white-tipped. My brush does say (in print, same as the pink flowers) \"Wet brush\" on its handle. I just want to make sure I purchased a legit \"Wet\" brand. Otherwise it seems like a good brush. I've had this particular one only a week, so I'm still trying it out. The way I clean and wash my Wet brushes is to pull out as much loose hair from them as I can with my hand. Then with a regular hair brush with soft bristles, I will brush it to remove the rest of the hairs, pulling them from the other brush. Or you could use a soft bristle scrub brush. Then I get both wet, put liquid soap on one and gently scrub the brushes together. That also brings up loose hair so you can grab and pull it out. Then I rinse both very well and dry upright on a wash rag. If you have thick curly hair or a lot of hair accumulated, you could try using the end of a rat tail comb down each row and pull up hairs before washing. Wet brushes seem to survive fairly hot tap water. Though I don't know I'd soak them in it. Likewise, I wouldn't put them in the dishwasher as some do. They might melt or the colors will fade away much faster than they normally would.",

In addition to the fact that it has extraordinary recipes, yet it additionally separates the Instant Pot and clarifies essentially all that you could need to think about it. The tips and outlines are especially useful for somebody like me who is continually endeavoring to change over recipes to the Instant Pot. The book covers the majority of the elements of the Instant Pot. Highly recommended!",
