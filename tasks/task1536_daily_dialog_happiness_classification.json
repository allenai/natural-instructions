I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation .  \n Person2: I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited .  \n Person1:     Well , then , you need an introduction .

        "input": " Person1:      Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .  \n Person2:  I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .  \n Person1:       What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?  \n Person2:  Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .  \n Person1:       Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?  \n Person2:  There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .  \n Person1:       Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .  \n Person2:  I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .  \n Person1:       What are your strengths and weaknesses ?  \n Person2:  My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .  \n Person1:       Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .  \n Person2:  I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .  \n Person1:       When do you find a job satisfying ?  \n Person2:  My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .  \n Person1:       How would your coworkers describe you ?  \n Person2:  First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .  \n Person1:       Do you have any questions ?  \n Person2:  Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? ",

It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .  \n Person2:  Www , man !  \n Person1:       In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .  \n Person2:  Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?  \n Person1:       Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .  \n Person2:  And then what happened ?  \n Person1:       Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want .  \n Person2:  It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ?  \n Person1:       That's a great idea !  \n Person2:  We could share a room ! It would be fun .

It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .  \n Person1:       I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?  \n Person2:  One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !  \n Person1:       When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?  \n Person2:  You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .  \n Person1:       What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?  \n Person2:  One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .  \n Person1:       So I need plenty of space for this exercise .  \n Person2:  Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .  \n Person1:       Great . Thanks for you advice ! ",

Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ?  \n Person1:       Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .  \n Person2:  I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .  \n Person1:       Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller !  \n Person2:  Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche .  \n Person1:       How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .  \n Person2:  You have always been so soft , Dave !  \n Person1:       Open your heart Dick .

Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital .  \n Person1:       What does this mean ?  \n Person2:  This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer .  \n Person1:       I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing .  \n Person2:  Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows .

You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .  \n Person2:  I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .  \n Person1:       Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .  \n Person2:  Thank you .  \n Person1:       But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative .

Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?  \n Person1:       500 pieces .  \n Person2:  No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .  \n Person1:       All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .  \n Person2:  I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .  \n Person1:       We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .  \n Person2:  No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .  \n Person1:       Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .  \n Person2:  Yes , we've already prepared one .

OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB .  \n Person2:  And for the Savings Deposit ?  \n Person1:       For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more .

In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .  \n Person1:       In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?  \n Person2:  That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul .  \n Person1:       I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?  \n Person2:  If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .  \n Person1:       There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?  \n Person2:  Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football .  \n Person1:       The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?  \n Person2:  Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ?

It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?  \n Person2:  Cinct de mayo ?  \n Person1:       No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .  \n Person2:  Do we get a day off from school then ?  \n Person1:       No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .  \n Person2:  Www , man !  \n Person1:       In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .  \n Person2:  Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?  \n Person1:       Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .  \n Person2:  And then what happened ?  \n Person1:       Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?  \n Person1:       I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .  \n Person2:  Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .  \n Person1:       Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .  \n Person2:  But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?  \n Person1:       Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .  \n Person2:  I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?  \n Person1:       That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .  \n Person2:  Really ?  \n Person1:       Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .  \n Person2:  Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?  \n Person1:       Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .  \n Person2:  How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?  \n Person1:       That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .  \n Person2:  So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?  \n Person1:       Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .  \n Person2:  Why did they want to found a college ?  \n Person1:       Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .  \n Person2:  Oh , I see .  \n Person1:       Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .  \n Person2:  When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?  \n Person1:       In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .  \n Person2:  It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .  \n Person1:       Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .  \n Person2:  Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .  \n Person1:       Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .  \n Person2:  I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .  \n Person1:       Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .  \n Person2:  That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .  \n Person1:       You can ask me any question at any time . ",

E . once a week .  \n Person2:  But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?  \n Person1:       Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ?  \n Person2:  Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first .  \n Person1:       Oh , I know . Thank you . ",

If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start .  \n Person2:  So what do you think it is ?  \n Person1:       I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?  \n Person2:  Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! ",

How can I help you ?  \n Person1:       I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .  \n Person2:  I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .  \n Person1:       I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .  \n Person2:  Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .  \n Person1:       In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?  \n Person2:  It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .  \n Person1:       Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?  \n Person2:  If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .  \n Person1:       It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .  \n Person2:  We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .  \n Person1:       If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .  \n Person2:  That is of great concern to out clients .

They can help us .  \n Person2:  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?  \n Person1:       It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper .

Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .  \n Person2:  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?  \n Person1:       Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .  \n Person2:  Why ?  \n Person1:       That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .  \n Person2:  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .  \n Person1:       It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time .

I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney .  \n Person1:       Mm-hm . How long were you there ?  \n Person2:  I was there for almost a year .  \n Person1:       Oh , OK .  \n Person2:  And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .  \n Person1:       So , did you , did you lose your finger ?  \n Person2:  Almost .  \n Person1:       Almost . Ah , you're lucky .

I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .  \n Person1:       I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !  \n Person2:  I know .

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .  \n Person2:  I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .  \n Person1:       But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .  \n Person2:  Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .  \n Person1:       Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . ",

I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .  \n Person1:       Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?  \n Person2:  Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under .

I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing .  \n Person1:       Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?  \n Person2:  Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .  \n Person1:       OK . What are your strong points ?  \n Person2:  Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point .  \n Person1:       And your weaknesses ?  \n Person2:  I think I sometimes try to be over-organized .

So this card helps me to keep track of my progress .  \n Person2:  Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you .  \n Person1:       Alright . Great .  \n Person2:  So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here .  \n Person1:       Great .

Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks .

Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .  \n Person1:       I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?  \n Person2:  Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .  \n Person1:       No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .  \n Person2:  I suppose so .

Are you OK ?  \n Person1:       I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option .

I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ?  \n Person2:  Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .  \n Person1:       That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ?  \n Person2:  Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider .  \n Person1:       So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ?  \n Person2:  That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . ",

But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs .

I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .  \n Person1:       But you taught children , yes ?  \n Person2:  Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .  \n Person1:       They actually study after school ?  \n Person2:  That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .  \n Person1:       Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?  \n Person2:  Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing .

I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible !  \n Person2:  Why do you think so ?  \n Person1:       Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed .  \n Person2:  You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures .  \n Person1:       It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie .  \n Person2:  Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes .  \n Person1:       I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling .  \n Person2:  I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong .  \n Person1:       Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ?  \n Person2:  No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak .  \n Person1:       Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role .  \n Person2:  I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ?  \n Person1:       I've no idea .

Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . \n Person2:  Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman !

I came here to study political science . \n Person2:  How do you like it ? \n Person1:       I like it so far . But my English still needs work . \n Person2:  I want to study Mandarin and international relations . \n Person1:       Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? \n Person2:  They teach regular characters . \n Person1:       I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . \n Person2:  You just said your English needs work , yes ? \n Person1:       Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . \n Person2:  Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . \n Person1:       You mean you and I ? \n Person2:  Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . \n Person1:       That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? \n Person2:  Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . \n Person1:       How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? \n Person2:  First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . \n Person1:       Would I help you with writing ? \n Person2:  No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . \n Person1:       I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? \n Person2:  Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 \n Person1:       Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 \n Person2:  So if you want to meet at 10 \n Person1:       It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . \n Person2:  And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . \n Person1:       Let me give you my phone number . \n Person2:  Sure . I'll give you mine too .

Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . \n Person2:  Scraping is too terrifying .

I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? \n Person1:       Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable .

And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . \n Person1:       You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . \n Person2:  I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . \n Person1:       You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . \n Person2:  A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . \n Person1:       Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . \n Person2:  I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . ",
