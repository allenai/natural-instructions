            "input": "Our 'impartial' broadcasters have become mouthpieces of the elite. When people say they have no politics, it means that their politics aligns with the status quo . None of us are unbiased , none removed from the question of power . We are social creatures who absorb the outlook and opinions of those with whom we associate, and unconciously echo them . Objectivity is impossible . The illusion of neutrality is one of the reasons for the rotten state of journalism, as those who might have been expected to hold power to account drift thoughtlessly into its arms . But until I came across the scandal currently erupting in Canada, I hadn't understood just how quickly standards are falling . In 2013 reporters at CBC, Canada's equivalent of the BBC, broke a major story . They discovered that RBC - Royal Bank of Canada - had done something cruel and unusual even by banking standards . It was obliging junior staff to train a group of temporary foreign workers , who would then be given the staff's jobs . Just after the first report was aired, according to the website Canadaland, something odd happened : journalists preparing to expand on the investigation were summoned to a conference call with Amanda Lang, CBC's senior business correspondent and a star presenter . The reporters she spoke to say she repeatedly attempted to scuttle the story, dismissing it as trivial and dull . They were astonished . But not half as astonished as when they discovered the following, unpublished facts . First ,  that Lang had spoken at a series of events run or sponsored by RBC  - for which she appears, on one occasion, to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars . Second , that she was booked to speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing company the bank had hired to implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues . Third , that her partner is a board member at RBC . Lang then interviewed the bank's chief executive on her own show . When he dismissed the story as unfair and misleading , she did not challenge him . That evening she uncritically repeated his talking points on CBC's main current affairs programme . Her interests, again, were not revealed . Then she wrote a comment article for the Globe and Mail newspaper suggesting that her colleagues' story arose from an outdated suspicion of business, was dangerous to Canada's interests, and was nothing but \"a sideshow\" . Here's what she said about the bank's employment practices:\"It's called capitalism, and it isn't a dirty word.\" Canadaland, which exposed Lang's conflicts last week, found that other journalists at the broadcaster were furious, but too frightened to speak on the record . But after CBC tried to dismiss the scandal as \"half-truths based on anonymous sources\" , Kathy Tomlinson, the reporter who had broken the story about the bank, bravely spoke publicly to the website . The following morning, staff in her office arrived to find this message spelt out in magnets on their fridge:\"Jesse Brown snitches get stitches\" . Jesse Brown is Canadaland's founder . CBC refused to answer my questions , and I have not had a response from Lang . It amazes me that she remains employed by CBC , which has so far done nothing but bluster and berate its critics . This is grotesque . But it's symptomatic of a much wider problem in journalism : those who are supposed to scrutinise the financial and political elite are embedded within it . Many belong to a service-sector aristocracy, wedded metaphorically (sometimes literally) to finance . Often unwittingly, they amplify the voices of the elite, while muffling those raised against it . A study by academics at the Cardiff School of Journalism examined the BBC Today programme's reporting of the bank bailouts in 2008 . It discovered that the contributors it chose were \"almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices . Civil society voices or commentators who questioned the benefits of having such a large finance sector were almost completely absent from coverage.\" The financiers who had caused the crisis were asked to interpret it . The same goes for discussions about the deficit and the perceived need for austerity . The debate has been dominated by political and economic elites , while alternative voices - arguing that the crisis has been exaggerated, or that instead of cuts, the government should respond with Keynesian spending programmes or taxes on financial transactions, wealth or land- have scarcely been heard . Those priorities have changed your life : the BBC helped to shape the political consensus under which so many are now suffering . The BBC's business reporting breaks its editorial guidelines every day by failing to provide alternative viewpoints . Every weekday morning, the Today programme grovels to business leaders for 10 minutes . It might occasionally challenge them on the value or viability of their companies, but hardly ever on their ethics . Corporate critics are shut out of its business coverage - and almost all the rest . On BBC News at Six, the Cardiff researchers found, business representatives outnumbered trade union representatives by 19 to one . \"The BBC tends to reproduce a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world,\" the study said . This, remember, is where people turn when they don't trust the corporate press . While the way in which the media handle the stories that are covered is bad enough , the absence of coverage is even worse . If an issue does not divide the main political parties , it vanishes from view , though the parties now disagree on hardly anything . Another study reveals a near total collapse of environmental coverage on ITV and BBC news: it declined from 2.5% (ITV) and 1.6% (BBC) of total airtime in 2007 to, respectively, 0.2% and 0.3% in 2014 . There were as many news stories on these outlets about Madeleine McCann in 2014 - seven years after her disappearance - as there were about all environmental issues put together . Those entrusted to challenge power are the loyalists of power . They rage against social media and people such as Russell Brand, without seeing that the popularity of alternatives is a response to their own failures: their failure to expose the claims of the haut monde, their failure to enlist a diversity of opinion, their failure to permit the audience to see that another world is possible . If even the public sector broadcasters parrot the talking points of the elite , what hope is there for informed democratic choice? o Twitter: @georgemonbiot .

            "input": "Obama and Cameron's 'solutions' for cybersecurity will make the internet worse. The current state of the US and UK governments' ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week- culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meeting to discuss the issue at the White House on Friday . When it comes to cybersecurity , it seems the UK and US want to embrace every crazy idea except what we know actually works . The UK's Cameron suggested earlier in the week he wants to outlaw certain forms of encryption , which could potentially lead to some of the world's most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK . That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, with various experts labeling it a nightmare for Internet security- on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China- and economically devastating for the British information technology industry . Meanwhile, the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial law that was used to prosecute Reddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz . If passed , the administration's proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity - for example, potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence for sharing your HBO GO password - all to supposedly target foreign hackers that the law would likely never reach . Less than 24 hours before Cameron-Obama the meeting , the Guardian published a secret report based on previously unreleased Snowden documents showing that the US government is fully aware that encryption is vital for security, and that the government risked leaving themselves vulnerable if they didn't start implementing it on their own systems quicker . The British government likely knows this too : many of their employees use email encryption ; and UK even recommend citizens use encryption to protect their data on a government website . At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn't embrace Cameron's proposal when asked about it , and even Cameron seemed to at least appear to back off his own anti-encryption proclamation , saying he's \"not trying to enunciate some new doctrine.\" But just because Cameron's been proven to be technically illiterate and may be attempting to publicly back away from his most radical proposal , that doesn't mean that he won't later push forward . FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron's just a few months ago , and Cameron used eerily similar talking points in Washington on Friday as Comey did in late 2014 . Plus, the rest of Cameron's plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban . And then there's the White House's so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem, which they unveiled earlier this week . President Obama introduced it saying we had to do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command's twitter account - but what he didn't say was that those proposals wouldn't have stopped those attacks at all . Part of the Obama administration's proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statute that the Justice Department used to threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail . (Aaron later took his own life while awaiting trial .) The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much so that there's been a movement for years to reduce them . And how the administration thinks increasing CFAA penalties is going to worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (or more likely pranksters) who take advantage of negligent password practices is anyone's guess . It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of people the government should consulting with before making these ill-thought proposals, not driving underground . At the same time ,  Congress has re-introduced their annual \"info-sharing\" cybersecurity bill , which is really just a thinly-veiled way to siphon off more of Americans' private data without court oversight . As EFF put it, the bill \"offered new authorities that could be abused by companies to spy on users, and offered broad legal immunity for disclosing the information obtained with the government . Sometimes they even granted companies the ability to 'hack back'... a perfect storm threatening our online privacy.\" The President's alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much . So, Congress and Obama seem to be finally on the same page about something: harsher penalties that won't reach the hackers they were worried about and invasive \"info-sharing\" that doesn't come close to solving existing problems . God forbid there be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship, or that both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption . Even full government gridlock would be better than that .",

            "input": "Can solar power replace oil in the Middle East? The rise of shale has posed a rare challenge to Middle Eastern oil, culminating in a global oil price war and moving OPEC members to slash profits to retain market share . But at a time when OPEC's hegemony over the oil markets has been challenged , let us not forget there is another abundant natural energy resource the Middle East possesses - the sun . The abundance of sunlight (and therefore solar power) offers Middle Eastern energy producers an opportunity to achieve first-move advantage in a market that appears to be the longer-term future of energy . In light of recent instability in oil markets, the importance of alternative renewable energies, particularly solar, has become all the more pronounced . The drop in oil prices has precipitated an efficiency rush in energy production in all producer nations . In the US, oil producers are leaving no stone unturned in the hunt to become as efficient and sustainable as possible . In Europe, there is a renewed push for renewable energy and some countries like the UK are also pursuing nuclear energy as a longer-term solution . In the Gulf, there are similar measures taking place to become more efficient in a more competitive energy market , and increasingly, they are turning to solar to achieve it . Domestic budgets . The Gulf states remains one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and make up the biggest exporting members of OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia . While some of these countries can afford to swallow current oil prices for now , they will nonetheless find it difficult to maintain their domestic budgets - all OPEC countries chose to cut prices in order to hold onto market share , this means slashing profit . It would not be unprecedented for these countries to encounter domestic trouble . The other, more serious concerns for these major oil producers, is the increasing consumer demand in their own countries . In past decades, the region has been able to sustain luxury alongside completely inefficient energy policies through government subsidies . But the entire energy outlook for the region is changing rapidly . Rising populations, a growing middle class, industry diversification and increasing consumerism has turned a number of countries in the Gulf region into major energy consumers . In Saudi Arabia, oil accounts for over 65 percent of all electricity production , in Kuwait it is 71 percent , in Lebanon it is 94 percent and in Yemen it's an astonishing 100 percent . This represents an energy policy that is inefficient and in the long run - unsustainable . Saudi Arabia is the biggest petroleum consumer in the region , it is the world's second biggest consumer of total primary energy, 60 percent of which is petroleum-based . But most importantly, it paints a distressing future for the region's oil export industry . If consumer demand continues to grow , it will eventually result in downward pressure on oil exports and could start affecting subsidies . Without a robust and efficient energy balance in the region, it will inevitably lead to these producer nations becoming less profitable with a weaker export outlook . And with competitors in the oil market like Russia, Iran and the North American shale, this is a long-term dynamic that will undermine Middle East's global energy dominance . However ,  the possibilities associated with harnessing Middle Eastern solar energy could be a game-changer . Solar is becoming much cheaper to invest in, and now has an established and ever improving infrastructure . Substantial investment in solar will act as a shield for the region's more valued commodity; oil . Saudi Arabia alone for example, could have made$43.8bn in additional oil revenue in 2013 were it not for its spiralling domestic consumption . It also would have acted as a massive stimulus to the country's finances . Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, announced it would be making solar energy investments across the country in an attempt to diversify the country's energy supplies . It is also expected to conserve the country's oil resources primarily for export . It has been a slow process but is nonetheless an important one for the future of the solar energy sector . One of the biggest success variables for any solar energy project is not just investment, but location . The Middle East's solar industry is one of the most economically sustainable and acts as the best conserver of the region's oil resources . Investment opportunity . It is also a very strong investment opportunity for those looking to invest in a sustainable, long-term energy sector with a ready market and significantly lower start-up costs then depleting energy exploration . But these new developments would also have another important advantage for the Middle East; a cleaner environment . The use of petroleum for electricity generation has made the Middle East's air quality one of the poorest in the world . Twenty-nine of the world's most polluted cities are in the MENA region . Recent energy challenges could have very costly consequences for the region if left unaddressed , but they could also reap huge rewards if met with robust energy reforms and additional investment in alternative energies, especially solar . And there are positive signs for the region . Saudi Arabia alone has announced a $109bn investment plan to generate a third of its electricity . Qatar has also made solar energy agreements with major renewable energy companies as part of its commitments to the Solar GCC alliance . How these measures materialise over the next decade or so remains to be seen , but there is room for optimism . What's more , the Middle East's unrivalled solar potential means that theoretically, it can become more then a just a world leader in fossil fuel production , it can become a world leader in renewable energy production as well .",

            "input": "CIA interrogations report: Feinstein offers aid and comfort to enemy, stabs heroes, allies in the back. Programing Alert : Author Ralph Peters will be a guest on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity\" on December 9 at 10pm ET . Tuesday's willful, unnecessary and gratuitously destructive release of the one-sided \"torture report\" at the insistence of outgoing Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.(backed by the White House) amounts to nothing less than providing aid and comfort to the enemy in wartime . Can anyone cite one practical good accomplished by releasing this gratuitously destructive report at this time? Will revealing successful practices make us more secure? No . The report provides a propaganda windfall for Islamist fanatics . Will it benefit our allies? No . It exposes those who took great risks to help us in the wake of 9/11 . Will it \"set the record straight?\" No . It distorts the record grotesquely in the interests of political correctness, blame-shifting and short-term political advantage . Over the decades, I've respected Senator Feinstein, even when disagreeing with her . Thus ,  I'm far more shocked by her self-serving release of this report than by anything the CIA did to protect us . One can only conclude that the senator and her acolytes are attempting not to reform our intelligence practices but to re-write their own role in what transpired . The senator and her colleagues (from both parties) were briefed in detail on every activity field agents took to protect us from further attacks . The senator and her colleagues (as well as the Department of Justice) approved every one of those practices . Now , the senator's saying,\"Even if we knew, we didn't know.\" Perhaps she is, indeed, suffering a much-delayed attack of conscience , but the awareness that the incoming Republican-majority Congress would never release such a biased report surely plays a role . And is it an accident that the report's release--the stuff of commanding headlines--has been timed for the day that Professor \"Americans-are-stupid\" Jonathan Gruber testifies on Capitol Hill about ObamaCare? What a monstrous betrayal it is to compromise our agents and our allies just to shove a lackey's testimony below the fold in tomorrow-morning's newspapers ... As for those supposedly horrendous actions taken by CIA personnel to convince blood-encrusted terrorists that cooperation might be the wisest course, they may have been harsh , but the times and our enemies were and are immeasurably harsher . But torture? What the Islamic State and its ilk do to their captives is torture . They shrink from nothing . We shrink from the thought of a terrorist gasping for breath . Senator Feinstein and her supporters argue that the American people have a \"right to know,\" but they don't know the American people . Living too long in a bubble with fellow members of the cultural elite, they have no sense of how the average American feels about terrorists who fly passenger aircraft into skyscrapers or who gleefully behead innocent captives in video clips . Far from being mortified by water-boarding or sleep deprivation (for working Americans sleep deprivation is a normal state of affairs from holding down two jobs and multiple shifts to feed their families during the Reign of Obama) , the folks I know back home in the Pennsylvania coal towns would skin terrorists alive then get out the salt shaker . My people weren't upset by water-boarding . They were upset-- infuriated-- by the collapse of the Twin Towers and the deaths of 3,000 Americans . Of course ,  the release of this report just now-- which may lead to the deaths of more Americans, as the senator has been warned-- is another sign of the Obama administration's desperation . Team Obama's genius for failure in every policy field, foreign or domestic, has left the administration's inner circle frantic to deflect attention from its parade of deceptions, derelictions and disasters . About the only thing left to them is to exhume, yet again, the mutilated-by-the-left corpse of the George W  Bush administration . For Team Obama, with its conviction that America's at the root of every evil, Bush is responsible for the Crucifixion, the Black Death, the Holocaust and Country music . But the average Americans so disdained by this White House(and by Professor Gruber) want to know what President Obama has done for them . And unless one belongs to an arcane interest group , the answer is \"Nothing.\" Even if we grant her the noblest intentions , Senator Feinstein has betrayed our country and its defenders . Will she accept responsibility for the aftermath of this report's release? The president certainly won't . Should things go wrong , the White House will give the senator a back-massage by a bus this holiday season . Our enemies would gladly exterminate every man, woman and child in the United States . Senator Feinstein just handed them a gift . But the president wrapped it .",

            "input": "'Bedblocking' - the result of social care policy that puts profits ahead of people. Bedblocking . What a phrase . People having to stay in hospital, even though they are well enough to be discharged, because there' s no social care in place for them . David Cameron says it's \"a demand problem\" . But it's not, of course . It's a supply problem . It's hard to make money from social care . So it's not massively amenable to privatisation . I suppose this was one of the areas where, Cameron fondly imagined, the Big Society would step in . As ever, instead, starving one part of the public sector of cash simply left another part struggling to cope with the consequences . Back in 2010, when Gordon Brown suggested implementing a 10% levy on inherited wealth to fund social care for older people , the Conservatives had this to say:\"RIP off. Now Gordon wants ? 20,000 when you die. Don't vote for Labour's new death tax.\" Instead , social care for older people has had its funding cut , so there' s simply not enough money to go round . The demand problem that Cameron now speaks of is one that was entirely predictable and, indeed, entirely predicted . Policymakers have been fretting over the future challenges posed by our ageing population for decades . Now this time has arrived , and there' s nothing there in the way of provision for it . Care for elderly people is one of those things that's not hard to sort out, given money, and almost impossible to sort out without it . It's one of those things that, in theory, offers choice- staying at home with support, moving into sheltered accommodation, going into residential care . In reality, however, people are so terrified of the prospect of being in a position where they have to make such choices that they'd rather not think about it at all . One knows vaguely that there aren't many decent alternatives , so staying at home becomes the one thing that is comforting . Being close to the past matters when the present and the future feel like a horrible staging-post before death . It doesn't help that there's so much sentimentality around the issue . Myleene Klass appeared to believe she was being socially aware by banging on about how awful the idea of a mansion tax is , because it would hurt little old ladies living in big houses that had been their homes for decades . But ,  actually, Klass was describing something that isn't necessarily that desirable: an elderly person living in a home she can no longer heat, clean or look after, the neighbours she once knew long gone, clinging to the past instead of living in and enjoying the present . One of the great paradoxes of old age is that, at a time in life when change is very dynamic and has to be managed a lot, people are persuaded that trying to stop time, instead of moving forward and adapting to circumstances, is the right thing to do . Care at home is pushed as the thing to aspire to, in part because - even though it's expensive, difficult to organise and not very satisfactory in outcome - it has the attractive advantage of needing no capital investment . Over Christmas, I watched the film Quartet , which is set in a retirement home for musicians . One was supposed to feel a bit sorry for its inhabitants , who had known success and adulation when they were young, and who missed those days . All they had to do to raise the funds to keep the home going was put on a concert featuring the legends that were themselves . Having looked at a couple of local care homes when my mother was ill a couple of years back , I can only say that the twilight years of those characters were indeed a fiction . Sure, nice retirement homes exist - if you can afford them . But the limitations of so many of them mean that the whole concept is sullied . Rather than being places where new phases of life are undertaken, they have become places you end up in when all hope of enjoying life is gone . It's interesting that inheritance has become so much an aspect of debate around care for elderly people . This, too, is a tacit signal that you are too old to spend your own money on yourself . At some point, the duty is to hang on to your assets, so that they can be passed on to your family - and without nasty government death taxes . It would be nice if people weren't encouraged to believe that it was selfish to invest in their own lives just because they are no longer young . Elderly people are blocking beds not just because they can no longer look after themselves at home, but also because our society is not encouraged to think of elderly lives as valuable and deserving of joy and fun, vitality and change . Lack of pay is one reason why people aren't queing up to work with older people . But another is that it's not seen as enjoyable , because older people are viewed as a bundle of sad, expensive, social-policy problems, rather than people with lives worth living to the full .",

            "input": "Billy Crystal is wrong. There is nowhere near enough gayness on screen. Comedian, actor and - apparently - bewildered Victorian time-traveller Billy Crystal disappointed millions of fans and general conscience-havers this week when, in an interview with the Television Critics Association, he said that he thinks gay characters on TV are \"pushing it a little too far\" . \"I hope people don't abuse it and shove it in our face,\" Crystal continued, referring to gay sex scenes, \"to the point where it feels like an everyday kind of thing.\" He later attempted a half-hearted backpedal, telling the Hollywood Reporter that, don't worry, he totally thinks straight people are gross, too : \"What I meant was that whenever sex or graphic nudity of any kind (gay or straight) is gratuitous to the plot or story, it becomes a little too much for my taste.\" Sporting try, Billy , but we can see your tell : several of your chosen turns of phrase have been used to dehumanise and deny representation to gay people for decades - \"shove it in our face\", in particular, is tantamount to a coded gay slur . For that matter, it is not even possible to \"shove\" heterosexual sexuality in anyone's face , because there is no human on earth whose face isn't already completely submerged in and saturated by it . Gratuitous straight sex is a defining plot device in pretty much all media: primetime soaps, daytime talk shows, beer commercials, Billy Crystal movies . We know what you meant . Of course ,  it's perfectly fine to be uncomfortable with overt displays of sexuality, regardless of orientation - everyone has the right to set and defend their own sexual boundaries . I, for instance, find the idea of a woman loudly faking an orgasm in a crowded delicatessen so unbearably awkward that it makes me want to crawl out of my skin and flush the rest of me down the toilet . And that's why I FAST-FORWARD THROUGH THAT PART OR WATCH SOMETHING ELSE . It's almost as though you can choose what media you want to consume without policing anyone's sexual expression and furthering the oppression of an already marginalised and underrepresented group . But Crystal's dull, antique disdain for gay sex actually manages to crystallise a very important, progressive point : not only is there not \"too much\" gayness in media , gayness doesn't go anywhere near far enough . Back up the gay truck and just flood the place . It's about time . If you want evidence that our media is broken (or, more unsettlingly, working just as it's intended) , look no further than the staggering whiteness, straightness, and maleness of the 2015 Oscar nominations . As Bidisha summed up in this paper last week: \"Every nominated best director, screenwriter, screenplay adapter and original score composer is a white man . All the nominated best actors and best supporting actors are white men . All but one of the best picture nominations are about how hard it is being an entitled, genius white man . All the nominated best foreign language film directors are men . All but one of the documentary directors - Laura Poitras for Citizenfour - is a man . In the best picture category, seven films are directed by white men and the eighth, Selma, is directed by a black woman, Ava DuVernay, who was snubbed for best director.\" When it comes to diversity in media- after hundreds of years of straight white guys telling straight white guy stories, deciding which subject matters are serious(straight white guy stuff) and which are frivolous (everything else), and congratulating themselves on being the best at fulfilling their own rigged, narcissistic standards - I'm not interested in parity . I want overcompensation . I want new stories . And I don't just mean that from a social justice standpoint . I'm bored . A time is going to come- in my lifetime, I hope - when just being an angsty white man won't be enough any more . It won't carry a movie . It won't justify an Oscar . That's not to say that straight white guy stories can't be compelling, heartbreaking and important  - simply that we've heard them already . We've heard them at the expense of millions of other stories that never get funding, that are rewritten and whitewashed, that are needlessly recentered around a white person a la Orange is the New Black . When these conversations come up , some genius inevitably pipes up with what they think is a trump card - some version of:\"Oh, so we should have a show where every character is a disabled black Muslim lesbian!?!?!?\" As though nothing could be more absurd and unthinkable . As though there aren't innumerable TV shows and movies with all-white ensemble casts that go uncritiqued . And , to answer your question , UM, YES . That show sounds incredible and I would watch the crap out of it . It's only an absurd concept if you believe that disabled black Muslim lesbians are somehow less valid, less valuable, than straight white men . They're not . There is no such thing as a niche human . Representation is humanisation , and we have an inexpressible amount of ground to make up if we want to begin to establish gay people and trans people and disabled people and people of colour and fat people and sex workers as fully realised human beings - not tropes, morality tales, or comic relief - in the public consciousness . I'd say we could stand a few decades of overrepresentation, in fact . Come on, Hollywood . Shove it in my face .",

            "input": "Boko Haram's deadly advance must be stopped, but how? Last week's massacre of perhaps 2,000 people in and around the Nigerian town of Baga, and the bombings of markets in the north-east using children perhaps as young as 10, mark not a new tactic for the violent extremist organisation Boko Haram, but an intensification of its existing behaviour . Boko Haram is pushing the boundaries of the extreme and is challenging - and seemingly succeeding - in overstretching Nigeria's 7th Infantry Division, tasked to fight the insurgents in the north-east . In recent months it has made significant territorial gains and is in control of many towns around the Borno state capital, Maiduguri , though this is in a constant state of flux as the military defends state capitals and recaptures lost urban centres . Speculation as to the aims of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, the real name of the network of Islamist, cultist and criminal elements that grew from a radical but initially largely non-violent movement, continues . And the logical conclusion is that it is capturing territory to carve out an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria . But the group is decimating what is in its path . And it is greedy : the longer Boko Haram goes unimpeded and the more confident it becomes, the more it seems to want . So perhaps what is its endgame is the wrong question . Boko Haram is fighting because it can , because it is a lethal fighting force and has children and conscripts to send into the field as terrified, intoxicated and indoctrinated weapons and shields . The question that needs to be answered is how did this terrorist threat grow to such horrifying proportions, killing thousands and displacing millions- a threat unimaginable in a democratic Nigeria 10 years ago? And what can be done to stop it? Nigeria's military is around 130,000-strong, and has been previously lauded for its peacekeeping successes in civil conflicts in Africa , but now , with a worsening conflict at home, questions are being asked about just how hollowed out such an important institution has become . There are varying reports as to why the 8,500 troops deployed to battle Boko Haram have been unable to halt its advance . Allegations of corruption; misallocated resources; poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly directed troops; fear; low morale; and deficient interagency cooperation all have a basis . While promises have been made to investigate reported abuses by the Nigerian armed forces against civilians, in December 2014 an army court sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice - for refusing to fight Boko Haram . In the short term , preventing Boko Haram from expanding further relies on a more effective military response with a much-bolstered force . But this is impossible without essential leadership from the centre, without tough calls and effective management . The international community will come under increasing criticism for not doing enough to stem the tide of Boko Haram's terror . Assistance has been offered by a range of partners including the US, UK, France, Russia and China - some of it has been declined - but it is likely more offers of assistance will come . Nigeria believes its neighbours Chad, Cameroon and Niger could be doing more . But domestic and international confidence in the will or capacity - or both - of Nigeria's federal government to take the decisions to mount an effective response is fast waning in the face of increasing casualties . Nigerians will go to the polls on 14 February to vote for a new president and national assembly . How much this violence, predominantly in three of Nigeria's 36 states, will affect the outcome is unclear because Nigerians face a range of daily challenges . There are concerns, however, that the majority of people in the states at the epicentre of the conflict - thought to be potential opposition supporters- will be disenfranchised, along with over a million internally displaced people . However politicised the crisis may become in the runup to elections, the insurgency will outlast the event .",

At least one is a grown-up walking the hallowed halls of Harvard University . His name is Ben Edelman . He not only teaches there , but he earned several diplomas including a law degree at that storied institution of higher education . But Edelman seems to have adopted the word \"higher\" as his personal calling card . You see , he's higher than you and me . Or at least he seems anxious to let you know it . A hardworking Chinese immigrant family found that out when the professor ordered a takeout meal of shredded chicken with spicy garlic sauce and three other dishes . Edelman thought he was overcharged by $ 4 bucks ($ 1 dollar more for each dish) , so he launched a relentless war on Ran Duan , who works with his parents at their restaurant, Sichuan Garden in Brookline . You can read the sordid details in a story at Boston.com where the website also published the unbelievable litany of Edelman's intimidating and condescending emails to Duan . The prof's remarks ooze with arrogance and conceit . Edelman's exchange with Duan has become a viral sensation , as it should . A Harvard professor vowing legal action over the sum of $ 4 dollars . Come on . The professor has now apologized for his treatment of Duan and his family , but his emails will leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone so supposedly \"learned\" could be so seemingly insufferable . Maybe that's what a Harvard education gets you these days -a degree in imperiousness . Arrogance aside, the professor's persistent threats of legal action constitute a shameful campaign of bullying . He uses his knowledge of the law --at least his tortured interpretation of it-- for a purpose that can only be described as abusive . It turns out , he has done this before to a different restaurant . Bullies tend to target the weak and vulnerable . For Edelman to use his advantage as a lawyer to berate the Duan family who have come from nothing as immigrants and are trying their best to make a living running a restaurant is, in a word, unconscionable . During one email exchange, Duan asked the professor,\"you seem like a smart man... don't you have better things to do?\" Bullies usually don't . For all I know, Edelman is a pretty good professor . That does not make him a good person . Clinical psychiatrists might find him to be an interesting case study in how living in the Harvard bubble can distort even the most agile of minds . Sometimes intellectuals take themselves too seriously . Sequestered from the experiences of the average man, they can lack common sense, kindness and decency . Edelman seems bereft of them all . There is a reason why places like Harvard are called\"ivory towers\" . All too often, they envelop an artificial atmosphere where intellectuals are disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life . So, it should be no surprise when guys like Ben Edelman explode like a bomb on some poor immigrant family trying to make a buck with the sweat of their brow . Fortunately, academic elitism is not contagious . Teaching at Harvard may be a lofty achievement in the egg-head world . But professor Edelman seems to lack the one quality which elevates people above all other primates: compassion . He might gain a measure of humility and understanding by getting a real job . Might I suggest washing dishes in a Chinese restaurant? The next time I visit the Boston area, I'll skip Harvard Yard . Instead ,  I plan to drop by the Sichuan Garden to try their sauteed prawns with roasted chili and peanut sauce . And I won't check the bill .",

Here in California, it's been a blockbuster week in politics : Barbara Boxer is finally stepping down as perma-Senator after over 20 years ; former San Francisco mayor and current lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom is running for governor ; and attorney general Kamala Harris gunning for Boxer's soon-to-be- vacated seat . Why does it matter? There' s certainly something compelling about Harris' daring bid for US Senate : there are only one in five senators are female in this Congress ; and there are only two black Senators currently (Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tim Scott from South Carolina) . If Harris won , she not only would contribute to the growing number of women in power, but having three actual black senators at one time would make history because, to date, two is the best we've been able to achieve as a nation . In America's entire history, only eight black people have ever been senators and of those, only half were actually elected, rather than appointed . Yet African-Americans make up about 13% of the population, according to the 2013 census . True proportional representation would see black senators in the double digits in Congress . California has outsized importance in the US economy : on its own, it is the world's eighth-largest economy, just behind booming Brazil but ahead of Russia and Italy . California's contributions are one of the chief reasons the US remains the world's biggest economy ... and a black woman is poised to be one of the most nationally influential politicians in the state . California's internal public policy tussles - and its standard more-liberal- than-the-nation solutions - often help lead the rest of the nation and the world forward, be it on pollution standards, minimum wage increases, medical marijuana legalization, organic produce certification, healthcare access for the uninsured, public-private technology innovation such as iHubs and tax breaks that encourage local production of zero-emission Teslas, same sex marriage and wetlands protections such as the CA Coastal Act of 1976 . California's politicians can bring to Washington the ability to combine strong, safe regulatory experience with a booming economy and environmental protections, offering a compelling counter-point to Republicans who argue otherwise . And ,  with the exception of Jerry Brown's first stint as governor from 1975-1983, California internal top politics has been tended to be dominated by southern California figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger - but Harris (and Newsom) are both northern California people through and through . Instead of Hollywood values and priorities holding sway in the state, northern California's tech-powered financial and cultural strength may finally have a chance to drive the state's politics . And while Boxer, her fellow senator Dianne Feinstein and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi all hail from northern California, they spend much of their time in Washington DC  - so Harris's move to DC will provide us with a new generation of representatives steeped in the area's emerging tech-focused culture . While I believe California has much to gain from politicians like Newsom and Harris who see their work as largely cooperative and people-focused- as opposed to the ideological culture warriors who normally represent us in national policy debates - there's a long road ahead for each . Harris, for instance, may have to contend with billionaire Tom Steyer and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in a Democratic primary (and Villaraigosa would make history of his own) . But Harris is likely to have a lot of support behind her and  - being young, at 50 - a run now for Senate still leaves the door open to run for governor 10 or 20 years down the road . After all ,  stranger things have happened in CA politics : who would have thought that B-list actor Ronald Reagan would rise from California to become the GOP's iconic president , or that Jerry Brown, now 76-years-old, would become governor again after over 30 years?",

Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage have each written to David Cameron saying they are willing to have TV election debates even if he doesn't take part . Cameron's people insist he won't come on unless the Greens are there too . Listen carefully and there is a faint creaking noise, the sound of a politician trying to wind back the great clock of politics . In Cameron's case, he wants it back to the happy days before Gordon Brown conceded the prime ministerial veto on TV debates . It might just work . Rule one in any prime minister's handbook is never give up an advantage . In an election, that's what being prime minister is - an advantage . That's why it took 12 general elections between most voters having access to a television in 1964 and the first (and last?) television debate in 2010 . Yet debates are as old as politics itself , and putting them on TV has had that \"well, obviously\" feel to it ever since the first US presidential debate in 1960 . It must have helped perpetuate the brand, that first contest , for it was between the two men whose lives and deaths shadowed the rest of the American century: the beautiful young upstart John F Kennedy and the so much less telegenic, even rather sweaty, Richard Nixon . Cameron's people have been trying to back out of TV debates in 2015 almost since the lights went down on the last debate of the last election campaign . It has been a carefully played, inch-by-inch retreat covered by protestations of enthusiasm, framed in the context of a wider concern for the state of democracy . Last August he ruminated on the way they sucked the oxygen out of the last campaign (and poured a good deal of it into the Lib Dems' camp) . Now he says he is standing up for the right of the Greens, excluded for- according to Ofcom - not being big enough . Questioning the value of the debates is easy . The doyen of electoral coverage, David Dimbleby, who chaired the BBC session, said later that he thought they didn't let in as much light as when politicians were made to face the voters on their own in the kind of Question Time event that, as it happens, he also chairs . There' s no doubt that accidental encounters with ordinary people- Brown's \"bigoted woman\", or Margaret Thatcher being confronted over the sinking of the Belgrano - have earned a place in history as moments of truth that have told a bigger story . There is something rather odd about the\"one of these people will be prime minister\" hype before a debate that has been widened to include Farage . But , of course, the debates aren't about debating in the traditional sense of the word , even when they are between two very different versions of the future , as they were in Scotland . What really mattered in those brutal encounters between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling was the extraordinary depth of Darling's antipathy to Salmond and, for a while, the unexpected haplessness of Salmond under pressure . That first debate will always be remembered as the moment the rabbit bit the car . All the same, Cameron's opponents cannot take victory for granted . They accuse him of running scared . The Twittersphere throbs with shouts of \"frit\" . It is a charge that might have a price for the Tory leader . It will certainly disconcert his less politically savvy supporters . But mainly it will just confirm the prejudices of those who were never going to vote Conservative anyway . What it does prove, if proof were needed, is that the Tories are running a core vote strategy . If the broadcasters find the nerve to go ahead anyway, which is a punt in itself , an empty podium would not look good . But try to imagine the view from the perspective of a Tory strategist : the bill for looking frit is tiny compared with the enduring burden of being savaged by Farage . For Cameron, the strategist would reckon, it would be like being assessed for a job by someone who had watched you in conversation with the pub bore . Putting the two together is on a par with divorce proceedings where the party who has walked out stands and shouts a string of excuses unconnected with the facts in a way that is somehow illogically appealing . Just say you've gone off him! And ,  of course, that's why it must be made to happen . Let's hear Cameron talking to both wings of his party at once . And just as importantly, please, please let's have the Greens in the room too . It really would be an outrage not to .",

An Army chaplain was punished for discussing matters of faith and quoting from the Bible during a suicide prevention training session with the 5th Ranger Training Battalion -- leading to outrage from religious liberty groups and a Georgia congressman . Chaplain Joseph Lawhorn was issued a Letter of Concern that accused him of advocating for Christianity and \"using Christian scripture and solutions\" during a Nov  20th training session held at the University of North Georgia . \"You provided a two-sided handout that listed Army resources on one side and a biblical approach to handling depression on the other side,\" Col  David Fivecoat, the commander of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade at Ft  Benning, Georgia, wrote in the letter to the chaplain . \"This made it impossible for those in attendance to receive the resource information without also receiving the biblical information.\" The Christian chaplain was warned to be \"careful to avoid any perception you are advocating one system of beliefs over another.\" However ,  attorneys for the chaplain, along with religious advocacy groups, say his comments are covered by the \"right of conscience clause\" that was passed in last year's National Defense Authorization Act, section 533 . CLICK HERE TO JOIN TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION! Chaplain Lawhorn was ordered to appear in the colonel's office on Thanksgiving Day where he was personally handed the Letter of Concern . Based on Col  Fivecoat's version of events -- you would've thought Chaplain Lawhorn had turned the suicide prevention workshop into a Billy Graham Crusade . However ,  that's not what happened . During the course of conducting the training session , Ron Crews, the endorsing agent for military chaplains for Grace Churches International, explained, the chaplain discussed his own struggles with depression and the methods and techniques he personally used to combat depression . He said the chaplain did provide a handout with religious resources -- but he also provided a handout with non-religious resources . \"The chaplain did nothing wrong,\" said Crews . \"At no time did he say his was the only or even the preferred way of dealing with depression. And at no time did he deny the validity of any other method.\" Lawhorn is one of the few Army chaplains to wear the Ranger Tab and Crews said it was through that identification that he shared his story about depression . \"His story involves his faith journey,\" Crews said . \"He was simply being a great Army chaplain - in ministering to his troops and providing first hand how he has dealt with depression in the past . That's what chaplains do. They bare their souls for their soldiers in order to help them with crises they may be going through.\" However ,  someone in the training session complained to the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers . That complaint led to a story on the Huffington Post . Michael Berry, an attorney with Liberty Institute, a law firm that handles religious liberty cases, is representing the chaplain . He said the person who filed the complained \"exploited\" the chaplain's \"vulnerability.\" \"It took a great amount of courage for Chaplain Lawhorn to discuss his own personal battle with depression,\" Berry said . \"At no time did he consider himself to be in a 'preacher' role.\" Berry called on the Army to rescind the Letter of Concern-- calling it a violation of the chaplain's constitutional rights . \"Not only is it lawful for a chaplain to talk about matters of faith and spirituality and religion in a suicide prevention training class- but the Army policy encourages discussion of matters of faith and spiritual wellness,\" Berry told me . \"The fact that one person in the class was offended changes nothing.\" Congressman Doug Collins, a Republican lawmaker from Georgia, whose district includes the area where the training session took place, fired off a letter to Col  Fivecoat expressing his concerns in the matter . \"I find it counterintuitive to have someone lead a suicide prevention course but prohibit them from providing their personal testimony,\" Collins wrote . He cited the Army's Equal Opportunity policy and how it was set up to protect the personal beliefs of military personnel . \"I fear Chaplain Lawhorn's freedom of expression was improperly singled out,\" he wrote . Liberty Institute tells me the Army will allow me to speak with the chaplain -- but not right now . And Col  Fivecoat sent me an email telling me that he would not be able to comment at this point . If I'm reading between the lines -- that Letter of Concern comes pretty close to accusing the chaplain of proselytizing . Crews agrees with my assessment . \"The bottom line is -- that is exactly what they are trying to accuse him of-- when nothing could be further from the truth,\" Crews told me . \"The military leadership needs to commend Chaplain Lawhorn, not condemn him.\" Berry said Americans should be shocked and outraged over Chaplain Lawhorn's punishment . \"His job is to save lives-- and he's being punished for trying to do his job,\" Berry said . \"He's doing everything he can to save them- and yet now they're trying to say - the way you're doing it offends me.\" I find it both repulsive and heartbreaking to know that we have a military that frowns upon a chaplain using a Bible to save a soldier's life .",

            "input": "The Charlie Hebdo cartoonists were smarter theologians than the jihadis. Rather disturbingly, one word seems to connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm . I say disturbingly, because pointing out some common ground may be seen as blurring the crucial distinction between murderous bastards and innocent satirists . Nonetheless ,  it strikes me as fascinating that the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion (all religions, it must be noted) - yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasm that inspires Jews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter those whose only weapon was the pen . So what's the connection? In one sense an iconoclast is someone who refuses the established view of things , who kicks out against cherished beliefs and institutions . Which sounds pretty much like Charlie Hebdo . But the word iconoclast also describes those religious people who refuse and smash representational images, especially of the divine . The second of the Ten Commandments prohibits graven images  - which is why there are no pictures of God in Judaism or Islam . And theologically speaking, the reason they are deeply suspicious of divine representation is because they fear that such representations of God might get confused for the real thing . The danger, they believe, is that we might end up overinvesting in a bad copy, something that looks a lot like what we might think of as god , but which, in reality, is just a human projection . So much better then to smash all representations of the divine . And yet this, of course, is exactly what Charlie Hebdo was doing . In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insisting that the images people worship are just human creations - bad and dangerous human creations . And in taking the piss out of such images, they actually exist in a tradition of religious iconoclasts going back as far as Abraham taking a hammer to his father's statues . Both are attacks on representations of the divine . Which is why the terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken in thinking Charlie Hebdo is the enemy . For if God is fundamentally unrepresentable, then any representation of God is necessarily less than God and thus deserves to be fully and fearlessly attacked . And what better way of doing this than through satire, like scribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God . It's only some Christians that might demur from this logic . For the Christian story (ie Christmas) tells of God coming into the world as a human being . And in doing this the divine takes on a representational form . Jesus, says St Paul, is the image of the invisible God . Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable . So I can see how some Christians might find disrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting . After all ,  they believe it's possible for images genuinely to capture something of God . But if images can't capture God- and that's the Jewish/Islamic position- then bring on the cartoonists . They should be encouraged to do their worst and disrupt our confidence that what we think of as God bears any resemblance to anything legitimately God-like . They are like Moses bringing down the golden calf . It is the ancient job of the iconoclast . But ,  of course, these terrorists weren't really interested in theology . They thought that Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribe they called fellow Muslims . And maybe they were . But whatever else was happening, it was the atheist cartoonists who were performing the religious function and the apparently believing Muslims who had forgotten their deepest religious insights . For any representation of the divine that leads people to murder each other deserves the maximum possible disrespect . @giles_fraser .",

            "input": "Charlie Hebdo and western liberalism. Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo . The culprits appear to have done so in response to the magazine's publication of cartoons deemed offensive to Muslims , though they were also thought to have been radicalised by the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq . French society - and indeed, the global reaction - has been united in its condemnation of the attack and French authorities mobilised the full strength of the state's law enforcement agencies to track down the assailants , who were killed after a standoff with police on Friday . As with most incidents of violence involving Muslims, however, the ensuing public discussion has revolved largely around resolute vows to uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression - and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom . As a result, the natural expressions of grief and sympathy on behalf of the victims have taken on the added quality of high-minded liberal support for the content of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, irrespective of the publication's history of racism towards Muslims and people of colour . Hegemonic narrative . It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalism that one could reach the conclusion that the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea . To frame these events without accounting for the broader context and power relationships at work inhibits any sensible understanding of the deep conflicts plaguing our world at present . By positing western liberal claims to freedom against Islam's supposedly intolerant attitude towards irreverent or serious critiques of it would be to ignore completely the history underlying the current tensions . The reality is that for as long as there have been liberal ideals staking their claim to the various freedoms western societies have come to sacralise, there have also been societies suffering from exploitation and subjugation at the hands of those professing these lofty principles . Even as they were establishing the very foundations of modern liberal societies, from the tenets of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion to the basis for democratic forms of governance, Enlightenment thinkers were nearly universal in their expression of support for a world built on racial hierarchies and the expansion of new European empires that depended largely on the use of violence to control colonial subjects . That these philosophers developed their racist outlooks towards Jews, Muslims, and blacks on the basis of \"reason\" and \"rationality\" makes such views more abhorrent than those derived from pre-modern modes of thought . Whether it is the racist expressions of Enlightenment philosophers or the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo , these provocative views cannot be separated from the broader political projects at work . At the same time that western liberalism gave rise to modern states committed to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law , it also saw to the continuation of slavery, the colonisation and subjugation of large segments of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, and global economic exploitation and environmental degradation . Within Europe, western liberal ideals, whose proponents had never concealed their racist and exclusionary outlooks, could not avert the rise of a fascist movement in the mid-20th century that pursued the extermination of millions of people . Even after the devastation of World War II, European appetites for destruction were seemingly unsatiated , as the next two decades were marked by struggles for independence from European powers by colonised peoples in the global south . Faced with the prospect of supporting the freedom of the Algerian people, many French liberal intellectuals instead offered enthusiastic support for the brutal suppression of the Algerian struggle in a war that featured the widespread use of torture and the death of over 150,000 Algerians . \"They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.\" Writing on European Jews, this quote comes not from a propagandist in Nazi Germany, but rather from Voltaire, the 18th century French philosopher whose name has been invoked frequently in recent days as a historic champion of the freedom of expression . Voltaire's views on Islam were no more tempered , as he authored an entire play dedicated to mocking its Prophet Muhammad as \"the founder of a false and barbarous sect\" and \"a sublime and hearty charlatan\" . While one can defend the right of satirists, government officials, and philosophers to espouse such beliefs  - the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie became a popular means of expressing solidarity with the magazine in the hours after the attack- in the face of this history, it should become clear that in the case of cultural production, context always matters . Destructive policies cannot be pursued successfully without the vocabulary and imagery of racism and hatred of the other . One cannot attempt to comprehend the actions of mass murderer Anders Breivik or the recent report on the US government's torture of Muslim prisoners solely against the backdrop of western liberal ideals . However , when one considers the rise of a pervasive Islamophobic atmosphere as seen in prominent discourses across the US and Europe , one can understand the reason such violence becomes possible and, indeed, normalised . The significance of the question of what can be deemed appropriate speech goes far beyond its propensity to offend Muslim minorities, to its potential to have corrosive effects on the broader society . In the same way that western governments take great care to prevent the spread of ideas and messages they consider culpable for radicalising Muslims (all pretensions about freedom of expression be damned) , they should consider the role that anti-Muslim cultural production plays in facilitating their own abuses of human rights, and radicalising their own citizens , as seen in the wave of anti-Muslim terrorism that has witnessed a marked rise in the past decade . Commenting on the recent string of Islamophobic statements by Bill Maher and Sam Harris , religion scholar Karen Armstrong noted,\"this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps\" . The current permissibility of dehumanising expressions against Muslims has a legacy in the anti-Semitic tropes of a century earlier . Both stem from the same noxious logic of exclusion . In fact , western countries have had no qualms about setting aside their liberal values to offer full-fledged support to authoritarian regimes in the Middle East that, incidentally, create the repressive climate that has been proven to give rise to militant extremism . Nor have western societies proved unwilling to abandon claims about support for free speech when the question of social cohesion arises . France banned rallies in solidarity with Gaza during last summer's war and the state has consistently prosecuted writers, comics, and even cartoonists whose work was deemed to risk \"disruption to the social order\" . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls commented on the state's robust record of prosecuting artists saying:\"Faced with this creativity of hate, should we do nothing? Certainly not.\" In 2008, Charlie Hebdo fired an artist and writer for a column that the editors found to be anti-Semitic . At this juncture, western Muslims remain excluded from national dialogues regarding the question of social cohesion . The historical continuity of racial discrimination, coupled with a ramped up pursuit of strategic objectives across a number of Muslim countries during the last two decades have seen to it that an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility has permeated the public sphere in the US and revived the legacy of intolerance in Europe . To understand and counteract the violent behaviour of extremists , these tragic events should be examined in light of this context, rather than through the lens of free speech . From Voltaire and the Enlightenment to the present, modern western discourses are replete with critiques of Islam . By contrast, the abhorrent violence by some Muslims is a recent phenomenon, and one that must be confronted by addressing the failure of western liberalism to live up to its stated ideals, not by reflexively continuing to sing its praises .",

            "input": "Charlie Hebdo: 'Us or them'. In the face of terrible deaths, at a time when we are so destructively polarised , this must be said bold and up front and repeatedly : No cartoonist deserves to be killed, ever . No innocent person shopping for kosher food deserves to be terrorised and murdered , either . All of those tragic deaths in France last week, including those of a policeman and policewoman, and numbering 17 in total, all of them are horrendous and incomprehensible . In the face of this terrible killing spree in France, at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and then at a kosher supermarket, the overwhelming reaction is revulsion . But at the same time, there's a need to respond in other ways as well, to frame a discussion that can prevent this tragedy leading to even more tragedies, or being spun out to lash out at other innocent people . And here is the trouble with the backlash that has already begun, and the demands that have being made in the name of \"solidarity\" . France today stages a unity march, an attempt to help heal a wounded nation, amidst a much wider discussion of the need to stand together in the face of terror . But within that discussion, there has been a distinct fundamentalism - for example, in the insistence that to support Charlie Hedbo's right to publish, we must reprint and replicate their work . It's an unnecessary conflation of two things: support for the right to do something and actually doing the thing . It should, of course, be possible to express disgust at the murders fully, without having to endorse certain types of offensiveness . And the French magazine, while broad-spectrum in its religious targets, has undeniably focused its gaze on France's Muslim minority in a racist manner, in recent years . There is, for media, a responsibility (the abrogation of which clearly does not invite murder) to not be tone deaf about the environments we live in: about ignored hierarchies of control; about powerless minorities and colonial heritage and migration and foreign policy; about how things feel when you are stigmatised, marginalised and scapegoated; about what it's like when you don't have a voice or much representation in the mainstream ; and when the majority culture insists that equality and liberty await all those who just learn to be more like the majority . If we don't create the space to say these things without casting those that do so as fanatical supporters of murder , then what is this limitless freedom of expression we keep insisting we are firmly on the side of? The demand that we all respond in a mass, uniform way also makes a basic error about how unity works - which is to forget that it can only survive if there are spaces between us ; solidarity and common ground take hold because of the existence of a spectrum in thought and experience, and not despite these things . Deadly terrorism seeks to stamp out the possibility of difference  - which is why, in condemning outright those atrocities in France, we need also to keep insisting on and cherishing our diversity . Meanwhile, equally fundamentalist is the predictable casting of blame at Muslims and their \"backward\" culture, painting this as a \"clash of civilisations\" and insisting that all Muslims repeatedly apologise for the slaughters in France . The now routine insistence that all Muslims apologise for all such atrocities has spawned a spoof Muslim iCondemn phone app for such eventualities - a curious development , since we have been led to believe that Muslims don't actually have a sense of humour . 'Civilised v barbarian' . The ridiculous \"civilised v barbarian\" argument has been skilfully taken apart by others - its false premises, hypocrisy and misguided superiority complex rigorously deconstructed . But there's grave danger in this sort of \"us or them\" thinking - not just in the physical attacks on mosques and Muslims in France , which have already begun and which are obviously bad enough . The danger in blaming Muslims for such atrocities is that we shirk any responsibility . And the harsh reality is that the French killings, just like previous terror atrocities in Britain, just like the European self-proclaimed jihadists that go and fight for the death cult Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIL), are all homegrown . We - not just Muslim society, but our societies - are accountable . We, not just the fanatics that recruit to and commit mindless terror, are bound up in the causes and the context in a way that makes it not just insulting but actively counterproductive to single out Muslims as bearing sole responsibility both for the crimes and for their prevention . If we don't own this terrible reality collectively , we won't be able to find a way out of it collectively , either - and that means we won't be able to find a way out of it at all .",

            "input": "Just when the Ched Evans debate couldn't get any lower, up pops Gordon Taylor OBE. No matter how much anyone prayed that the Ched Evans \"debate\" had completed its race to the bottom this week, it was never going to have done so until we'd heard in full from Gordon Taylor . That pleasure was always in the post , and yesterday the PFA chief delivered, with what we might painfully cast as football's version of Godwin's law: a comparison with Hillsborough . \"He wouldn't be the first person to be found guilty, maintained his innocence, and been proved right,\" Taylor opined to the BBC . \"We know what happened with Hillsborough.\" Oh, man  ... Gordon Taylor . Or rather, GORDON TAYLOR OBE, as his name appeared in my inbox when he emailed me once . Sensationally dim, wantonly self-interested, wildly over-remunerated and frequently morally compromised, Gordon functions as an auto-satire on all the worst things people think about football . Reputed to be the highest paid union official in the world, and one who has been in his job for just the 33 years , Taylor has now said he didn't mean\"to upset anybody\" , though I need hardly add that he has no plans to consider his position after his latest display of incompetence . In which case, I hope he'll forgive my considering it for him - an act that has become as essential an annual event for me as putting up the Christmas tree or rewatching the early work of Steven Seagal . Unless Taylor's presence is dramatically revealed as the second-highest-profile instance of affirmative action for idiots in public life - the first being Iain Duncan Smith's position in government - then it hardly needs pointing out again that Gordon is no longer fit for purpose , if indeed he ever was . But more on his record shortly . That Taylor should have rifled through his Rolodex of metaphors and alighted on the absolute archetype of victim-blaming in order to continue obliquely victim-blaming in the Ched Evans case ... well, perhaps there's a mirthless laugh to be had there . But it would take a stronger stomach than mine to manage it . The sadness - or rather, one of many acute and diverse sadnesses - is that this was a week in which football was crying out for an intelligent and sensitive advocate, finding itself once more cast in a role it should never be required to occupy in a truly civilised society . All manner of people appeared convinced that the game should mitigate the deficiencies of the criminal justice system , just as a worrying number were keen to say Evans was absolutely welcome to work again - flipping burgers or sweeping the streets . These are the jobs that are fit for rapists , we must infer , which must feel hugely complimentary to those non-rapists who are putting in shifts doing the same for minimal pay right now . Meanwhile , as the Mail's Martin Samuel pointed out, footballers - footballers!-\"are placed in the same bracket as doctors, teachers or legal professionals\" . If that seems to you like a view of society worth shoring up , the week will have felt distinctly encouraging . As for football fans - the great \"them\" of many debates - they have spent the week being cast as too thick and impressionable to be able to make their own judgments about a convicted rapist . Evans could have been nothing but a role model, presumably to the vast tumult who turn out at Boundary Park each week (4,415 on average last season) . It's as depressing as it is disturbing . Such toxicity and lunacy have attached themselves to football and its place in our society that those who love the sport as well as those who play it really need the calm, cool intellect and charm of a Shami Chakrabarti to lobby in their real interests and those of the game . Instead ,  they have Gordon Taylor , whose focus was memorably dismissed by Peter Schmeichel during one stage of the Paul Gascoigne saga . \"Instead of getting great deals on cars and other luxury goods for members,\" the former Manchester United and Denmark goalkeeper fumed,\"PFA should commit more time and funds to help the like of Gazza.\" Taylor was stung - into self-defence, of course . \"Peter doesn't know what we've done for Paul,\" he announced to the Press Association,\"a lot of which has to be confidential.\" It certainly does . Except Gordon just couldn't bring himself to keep it that way . The next few days were spent with this union leader giving detailed interviews on Gascoigne's mental state and past treatment , in which he divulged telephone calls with the player, made off-the-cuff pseudo-clinical diagnoses, and - unbelievably - used the union's own website to warn : \"If we're not careful , it is going to be akin to George Best.\" Then again, Taylor had form with sharing details of members' treatment, having done the same with Joey Barton only a few months previously . Anyway, on we go . In 2013 came the revelation that Taylor had amassed a? 100,000 debt to a bookmaker - almost an inevitability to those who recalled him pontificating about a \"zero tolerance\" approach to betting among players just a couple of years before . And no round-up of Gordon's greatest hits would be complete without a look at that endlessly intriguing confidentiality deal he signed with News International , which awarded him a? 700,000 settlement for phone-hacking in return for his silence . As the News of the World's lawyers later had it in a letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, Taylor's lawyers had informed them that he \"wanted to be vindicated or made rich\" . Given that he reportedly earns? 984,000 a year (maybe more these days) , you might judge him to be rich already - but of course ,  we know which option won out, a deal that precluded Taylor from breathing a word about phone-hacking to any of his union's members , who he might reasonably have concluded could have been victims themselves . As they were eventually proved(by others) to have been . So there you have him: the pastoral carer who reveals details of his members' mental health in the noble cause of self-defence . The gambler who wishes to outlaw gamblers . The ur-phone-hacking plaintiff who agreed to take the? 700,000 and say absolutely nothing about the matter, despite being responsible for players who of course turned out to have been targeted too . And now he is the victim-blamer's victim-blamer, in a week where, you might have hazarded, even Katie Hopkins couldn't have contrived to make a grim situation worse . Still ,  experience would indicate that Taylor ignores his detractors at the very opposite of his peril . So all that remains is for me to take the early opportunity to apologise for next year's inevitable appearance of this column, and bid Mr Taylor a cordial au revoir .",

The daylight following the darkness . After the bloodshed and incessant school attacks of 2014, let 2015 be a year of hope, of action and the fulfilment of a promise made 15 years ago to boys and girls across the world . They are waiting and watching . The famous novelist JK Rowling, leader of a charity helping 25 million orphans, recently asked;\"Who is easier to silence than a child?\" Because children have no votes and traditionally little voice , the expectation is that they will not protest . But be certain about this - young people whose rights have been violated will be silent no more . I know this is true because in the space of a few hours last month I watched in awe as tens, then hundreds, then thousands, then hundreds of thousands showed their outrage and their unity following an attack on a school in Pakistan in which 132 children were massacred . A petition launched in the aftermath of the attack, to honour those killed and demanding education for all, is now 1.5 million names strong and is still growing as each precious minute passes . One voice . In the future, people will look back on this generation and they will say an historic civil rights struggle for the rights of young people was born . This, I believe, must be a time of hope . People need hope . Hope is that small voice that says we will not be silenced if we have strong beliefs we want to follow . We must never stop believing that the cause we are talking about can be won in our generation . And remember , we do not break promises to children . We crossed our hearts . The United Nations told the world that every boy and every girl, everywhere, would have access to a school and to an education and to opportunity . Its official name is Millennium Development Goal 2 and the official target is universal primary education . Unofficially, it's the only chance of a life for millions and millions of children . Now , as the clock ticks down towards zero hour we are trying but toiling to make it happen . But we can change it . There is time . There are seven other MDGs , all vital but none as critical to our children's . With just 11 months and 20 days to go , there are still 58 million boys and girls who will be failed by a broken promise and never even have a day's learning . There are hundreds of millions more who will not finish their education . Less than a month ago two champions of global education and girls' rights shared a platform in Oslo, Norway . Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi stood in front of the world, proud and deserving joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize . Their brave words and actions rightly rewarded , then so many of their hopes for the future crushed when six days later came the worst school atrocity of all time . 132 boys and girls slaughtered by Taliban gunmen in Peshawar . On the same day 15 children were bombed to death by terrorists attacking a school bus in Yemen . The next day dozens of school pupils were killed and 100 abducted in a repeat of the Boko Haram attack almost nine months ago when 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria were abducted, yet to return home . Last year was like no other in which vulnerable youngsters - whose right to be shielded from war is supposedly guaranteed in successive United Nations charters and resolutions- were systematically violated, exploited, injured, raped and killed . The bombing of schools in Syria was followed by the militarisation of schools in Gaza and then by verified reports of child atrocities and rape in Iraq . According to The Yazidi Fraternal Organization (YFO), thousands of young Yazidi women and children are being used by ISIL as sex slaves . And there are now an estimated 250,000 child soldiers conscripted into militias round the world; 100,000 of them girls . From Syria and Iraq to South Sudan and the Central African Republic we have seen more children uprooted and displaced than at any time since the Second World War . The number of child refugees has risen by nearly two million in just one year to a staggering 25 million - the population of a medium-sized country . And now the seemingly endless violation of children's rights is being eclipsed again and again by the growing use of schools as theatres of war . Twenty five years ago, the world signed up to the Convention for the Rights of the Child . 2014 will be remembered as the year of the violation of the rights of the child . We have 11 months left to ensure 2015 is about the delivery of the rights of the child . Youth organisations such as Global March Against Child Labour, Girls Not Brides and A World at School, which now sponsors nearly 1,000 youth ambassadors, are becoming global leaders of a youth liberation struggle . They are fighting child marriage, child labour, child trafficking and discrimination against girlsand the principal way to end exploitation is to deliver free compulsory education . One of the #UpForSchool petition signatories was Malala Yousafzai, herself the victim of a Taliban gunman . She will tell us there is still hope . People are angry about what is happening to children . Even angrier still are young people themselves . Do not underestimate them . They are connected , they talk to each other and they understand each other . They are as one and they are seething . Recently, in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, I stood with 1,000 young people as they bowed their heads for victims of the Pakistan school attack . They all signed the petition . The same happened a few days earlier when thousands of young people demonstrated in Kenya and at the Nobel ceremony in Oslo more than 6,000 children gathered to show unity for girls' rights and for education . For too long young people have relied on adults who have done too little to stop the violation of the rights of the children for whom they were responsible . In 2015 it will be a civil rights struggle of young people LED by young people that will be the world's best hope .",

            "input": "Children in our towns and cities are being robbed of safe spaces to play. Where do the children play? Where can they run around unsupervised? On most of the housing estates I visit, the answer is hardly anywhere . A community not built around children is no community at all . A place that functions socially is one in which they are drawn to play outdoors . As Jay Griffiths argues in her heartrending book Kith, children fill the \"unoccupied territories\", the spaces not controlled by tidy-minded adults, \"the commons of mud, moss, roots and grass\" . But such places are being purged from the land and their lives . \"Today's children are enclosed in school and home, enclosed in cars to shuttle between them, enclosed by fear, by surveillance and poverty and enclosed in rigid schedules of time.\" Since the 1970s the area in which children roam without adults has decreased by almost 90% . \"Childhood is losing its commons.\" Given all that we know about the physical and psychological impacts of this confinement , you would expect the authorities to ensure that the remaining 10% of their diminished range is designed to draw children out of their homes . Yet almost everywhere they are designed out . Housing estates are built on the playing fields and rough patches children used to inhabit, and offer almost nothing in return . In the government's masterplan for England, the national planning policy framework, children are mentioned only twice: in a catalogue of housing types . In parliament's review of these plans, they aren't mentioned at all . Young people, around whom our lives should revolve, have been airbrushed from the planning system . I spent Monday wandering around the new and newish housing developments on the east side of Northampton . I chose this area because the estates here are spacious and mostly built for families : in other words, there is no possible excuse for excluding young people . In the places built 10 or 20 years ago, there is plenty of shared space , but almost all of it is allocated to cars . (You can see the photos on my website .) Grass is confined to the roundabouts or to coffin-like gardens , in which you can't turn a cartwheel without hitting the fence . I came across one exception - a street with wide grass verges . But they sloped towards the road: dangerous and useless, a perfect waste of space . This land of missed opportunities, designed by people without a spark of joy in their hearts, reifies the idea that there is no such thing as society . Had you set out to ensure that children were neither seen nor heard, you could not have done a better job . On the last day of the holidays, which was warm and dry, across four estates I saw only one child . By comparison, the Cherry Orchard estate just completed by Bellway Homes is a children's paradise . But only by comparison . Next to the primary school, with plenty of three- and four-bedroom houses, it is designed to appeal to young families . But in the middle of the development, where a village green might have been, there' s a strange grassy sump, surrounded by a low fence . It's an empty balancing pond, to catch water during exceptional floods . Remove the fence, plant it with trees, throw in some rocks and logs, and you'd have a rough and mossy playground . But no such thing was in the plans . Other shared spaces on the estate have the charming ambience of a prison yard : paved and surrounded by garden fences almost nine feet high . There were a few children outdoors but they seemed pressed to the edges, sitting in doorways or leaning on fences . Children don't buy houses , so who cares? Throughout the country, they become prisoners of bad design, and so do adults . Without safe and engaging places in which they can come together, no tribe forms . So parents must play the games that children would otherwise play among themselves , and everyone is bored to tears . The exclusion of children arises from the same pathology that denies us decent housing . In the name of market freedom, the volume housebuilders, sitting on their land banks, are free to preside over speculative chaos , while we are free to buy dog kennels priced like palaces in placeless estates so badly designed that community is dead on arrival . Many want to design and build their own homes , but almost no plots are available , as the big builders have seized them . In Scotland the government is considering compulsory sale orders , which would pull down prices - essential when the speculative price of land has risen from 2% of the cost of a home in the 1930s to 70% today . A national housing land corporation would assemble the sites and supply the infrastructure, then sell plots to community groups, housing associations and people who want to build their own . It goes far beyond England's feeble community right-to-build measures , which lack the muscular facilitation that only public authorities can provide . But it's still not far enough . What if people were entitled to buy an option for a plot on a new estate, which they would then help to plan? Not just the houses, but the entire estate would be built for and by those who would live there . The council or land corporation would specify the number and type of homes , then the future residents - including people on the social housing waiting list - would design the layout . Their children would help to create the public spaces . Communities would start to form even before people moved in , and the estates would doubtless look nothing like those built today . To the Westminster government, this probably sounds like communism . But as countries elsewhere in Europe have found, we don't need volume house builders, except to construct high-rises . They do not assist the provision of decent, affordable homes . They impede it . What is good for them is bad for us . Bellway, its brochure reveals, asked children at the neighbouring primary school to paint a picture of a cherry orchard, and displayed the winning entries in its show home . \"Why not pop over to say hello, view our wonderful development and sneak a peek?\", it asks . That's the role the children were given: helping the company to sell the houses it had already built . Why can't we shape the places that shape our lives?",

He's a deacon at a Baptist church and also teaches Sunday school . By all accounts - he is a decent and honorable man . And now- he is unemployed . Cochran, who served seven years as the chief of the Atlanta Fire Departmant lost his job over a book he wrote about biblical morality titled,\"Who Told You That You Were Naked?\" A small portion of the book contained what critics called homophobic language . Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed suspended Cochran last month . He was fired on Jan  6- the day he was supposed to return to work . \"I profoundly disagree with and am deeply disturbed by the sentiments expressed in the paperback regarding the LGBT community,\" Reed wrote last November on his official Facebook page . \"I will not tolerate discrimination of any kind within my administration.\" Reed told reporters Cochran was not fired because of his religious beliefs . Rather , he said, the fire chief was ousted because of poor judgment . The mayor accused the chief of not getting permission to write the book- a charge Cochran denies . The mayor also alleged Cochran distributed the book to members of the fire department . Cochran readily admits that he gave copies of the book to close associates within the department . It should be noted that the individual who initially complained about the book did not receive a copy from the fire chief . And for the record - a city investigation determined the fire chief had not discriminated against LGBT employees . But The New York Times editorial board said it doesn't matter if Chief Cochran was innocent . That's not the point, they wrote Tuesday in a scathing editorial titled,\"God, Gays and the Atlanta Fire Department.\" \"It should not matter that the investigation found no evidence that Mr  Cochran had mistreated gays or lesbians,\" the Times wrote . \"His position as a high-level public servant makes his remarks especially problematic, and requires that he be held to a different standard.\" Robert White, executive director of the Georgia Baptist Convention, called The New York Times editorial \"quite remarkable.\" \"It declares his innocence and then declares him guilty,\" he said . \"Guilty of what? He didn't discriminate against any homosexuals. He vowed that he wanted to have a healthy work place for all of his employees.\" The Times went on to argue that while Cochran is free to believe whatever he wants- there are limits to where he can believe and still maintain gainful employment in the public arena . \"If he wants to work as a public official, however, he may not foist his religious views on other city employees who have the right to a boss who does not speak of them as second-class citizens,\" the Times wrote . \"There is a prejudice against Christians in this country right now,\" White told me . Dr  White made his bold proclamation just hours before hundreds of Christians were expected to gather at the Georgia capitol to protest the firing of Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran . Among those taking up his cause are the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, the Georgia Baptist Convention and the Family Research Council . Click here to follow Todd on Facebook! \"What happened to Chief Cochran goes to the core of religious freedom,\" he said . \"Georgia Baptists are deeply concerned about the mistreatment of Kelvin Cochran.\" Franklin Graham said Cochran was a target of \"politically correct bullying against Bible-believing Christians\" and vowed to stand alongside the embattled former fire chief . Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said the Times had \"reached a new low in blatant hypocrisy.\" \"The New York Times is calling for public servants to be held to a different standard when it comes to their freedom of speech and religion,\" Perkins said . \"I think most Americans are quite happy with the standard that we have had for the last 226 years- the First Amendment.\" If nothing else , Cochran's public shaming at the hands of Atlanta's mayor has unified Georgia Christians from all denominations and races . \"This is one of those things that can bring people together from all of the political spectrum,\" Garland Hunt, chairman of the Network of Politically Active Christians, told me . \"This is about religious freedom. This is not about whether a person is conservative or liberal.\" The reality is that a good man - a husband and father and grandfather - was fired from his job because his boss objected to his religious beliefs . That just ought not to happen in the United States . I'm reminded of something Chief Cochran told me . \"The LGBT members of our community have a right to be able to express their views and convictions about sexuality and deserve to be respected for their position without hate or discrimination,\" he said . \"But Christians also have a right to express our belief regarding our faith and be respected for our position without hate and without discrimination. In the United States, no one should be vilified, hated or discriminated against for expressing their beliefs.\" Maybe those who preach tolerance and diversity might want to consider practicing it, too .",

            "input": "CIA interrogation report: Democrats want to punish America, blame Bush. In its ideological zeal to punish America , the outgoing Democratically- controlled Senate, plans to make public a report that, according to Fox News will examine \"the alleged use of torture by the CIA.\" Although the 6,000 page full report will remain classified , the 500 page summary is expected to be released to the public in coming days . According to press reports from those who are familiar with the study, it is expected to portray the American intelligence community in the worst possible light . The report's release and details about CIA interrogations that took place a decade ago will endanger Americans abroad today, destroy essential relationships with foreign intelligence communities going forward, and cripple American human intelligence gathering networks for a generation . Put bluntly , Democrats in the Senate are behaving like tenants who got evicted and decide to trash the house on their way out the door . There is nothing to be gained by releasing the report . The CIA's actions in the immediate aftermath of September 11 attacks have long since ceased . Although President Obama has approved release of the report's summary , even Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the report's release will put Americans and U.S  embassies at risk of retaliation . So why do this now? Perhaps Democrats in Congress think that by excoriating our intelligence community before the entire world they will expiate the sins of the previous administration . Yes, it's another chance it's to blame Bush! This is the apology tour on steroids . According to media reports, the report concludes that we tortured terrorists . These are the same terrorists who blew up the World Trade Center, bombed the Pentagon, and tried to level the U.S  Capitol . These are the same terrorists that today have beheaded Christians, Westerners and, just this past weekend, another American citizen . Think back to the days after September 11 . We were blind about Al Qaeda . Most Americans feared another attack was imminent . And the best legal advice in government said CIA actions to get that information were legal . So CIA officers did what they thought necessary to protect Americans . A decade later we're suddenly castigating them for it . Second ,  the report concludes that the intelligence gathered from CIA's actions wasn't effective . Yet that has been disputed by the very people in the Obama administration who used it to track down Usama bin Laden . To quote highly regarded former CIA Director Gen  Michael Hayden,\"it is inconceivable to believe that three different CIA directors, and three different Deputy CIA directors, conspired over a seven year period to lie about the program's effectiveness . Third ,  there is a rule in foreign policy like the one in medicine . First ,  do no harm . Public release of this report will do immeasurable harm . It will encourage terrorists around the world to launch revenge attacks . It will cause foreign intelligence agencies to clam up and no longer cooperate with US intelligence for fear that their sources and method will be blown . It will cause every American intelligence officer to go into the defensive crouch -- don't stick your head out to protect America because years later somebody in government who wants to score political points will chop it off . Finally ,  take a lesson from history . We did this once before, in the 1970's , when presidential-hopeful Senator Frank Church launched a widespread investigation of the CIA . It didn't work , Senator Church's presidential aspirations never got off the ground . But his handiwork crippled American intelligence gathering for a generation . American agents overseas were killed , foreign intelligence agencies stopped sharing intelligence with us , our own human networks collapsed , and CIA officers played it safe and stopped thinking outside the box . This was one of the reasons a generation later we never knew about a bunch of Islamic extremists in a cave in Afghanistan plotting to take down the Twin Towers . Releasing the report to the public will do considerable harm to our efforts to gather essential intelligence about those hoping to do us harm . It will be a self-inflicted wound . The next time we are caught unprepared it won' t just be with 747s flying into buildings it could be with weapons too terrible to contemplate .",

            "input": "CIA interrogations report: New Congress must tackle how to get intelligence right. As I read news reports detailing the Senate Committee Report on the CIA interrogation program after the September 2001 terrorist attacks , I concluded there are several recurring problems to this latest effort to govern our national intelligence agencies . As an old man, I have had the opportunity to have first-hand exposure to how complex it is for Congress or even the White House to assert control over these vital intelligence activities . After there were revelations in the 60's that the CIA had engaged in a variety of activities that were highly questionable including efforts to kill Fidel Castro and others , the Carter administration reacted and went through the kind of political process that many are urging should be done today . In an attempt to purge the agency of its tendency to use nefarious individuals to carry out some of its covert projects, the CIA was directed to refuse to associate with any persons who could not meet the test of good character . One CIA officer told me how absurd that directive was . \"We are trying to get people to betray their governments and to lie and cheat on our behalf. You cannot expect us to find those people in the front pew at the local churches.\" Perhaps the directive was well-intentioned but it made no sense . Richard Helms, the CIA head from 1966 to 1973, whom I knew well and admired greatly, told me of his personal problems when he was indicted by the Carter Justice Department for perjury . In testimony he gave to the Congress, Helms denied under oath his agency had been involved in the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile, an action ordered by President Nixon . Helms told me he was following instructions he had been given repeatedly by various Senators including such powerful men as Senators Richard Russell and Walter George to the effect that if he were ever asked at an open hearing a question the answer to which \"would put any of our people at risk\" he should feel free to protect the secrets in whatever manner he wished . Of course Helms knew of many instances when he and others in the Agency had relied on that authority . Helms was defended by the powerful Washington lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams and the case against Helms was quickly resolved when Williams explained to the Justice Department his plan to have Helms take the stand and recite all the covert programs that had been protected by various forms of prevarications by intelligence officials . Of course no such trial in public made any sense and the danger to ongoing intelligence activities of testimony such as Williams would have had Helms provide was so great the ill- advised indictment of Helms resulted only in a slap on the wrist . Williams made a deal in which Helms pled guilty to a misdemeanor with no punishment . Later ,  President Ronald Reagan gave Helms the National Intelligence Medal as an obvious act of apology . Perjury is not to be condoned and lying before the Congress is criminal conduct . But the intelligence world involves subtle issues . If we want to have a major intelligence effort , there are clear costs to be accepted . One of them is that much of the necessary supervision by Congress has to be done with deft caution . It can hardly be conducted in open hearings . Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law Professor and prominent civil libertarian, contends torture to save lives should be permitted as long as there are rigorous procedural safeguards . He points out the Israelis have used torture for years with apparent success . Getting information from unwilling prisoners cannot be done without some risks to civilized process . It can be a dirty game . I once visited Vice President Walter Mondale at his White House office where he served under President Carter from 1977 to 1981 . His desk was piled high with documents he said were mainly reports from the CIA . He volunteered his frustration at the then weaknesses at the CIA . He told me he had come to regret he had been such a vigorous supporter of the gutting of that agency that followed the suggestions of the so-called Church Committee on which Mondale had served as a Senator . His comment was an isolated one and I merely listened . But the effects of the Church Committee recommendations were damaging to the CIA and the remedial work took years . Every forty years we may have to endure periodic reports like those produced under Senators Church and Feinstein that represent well intentioned reviews of the intelligence community . The suggested reforms speak of following our sense of justice and fairness and civility . The problem is obvious : Our enemies do not play fair and war is Hell . Any reforms of the intelligence universe cannot easily be effected . The idea of a transparent intelligence agency is an inherent contradiction . Moreover how can Congress talk openly of reforms without damaging our intelligence efforts? And politicians are among those least likely to be willing to accept the secrecy that is at the core of any well managed intelligence agency . Can we imagine a Congress that can keep the secrets? The new flurry of attacks on the intelligence community -- harmful and unnecessary-- will not have any more lasting impact than did the indictment of Helms or the work of the Church Committee . But there should be some quiet and thoughtful debate within our Congress about how it can supervise these vital intelligence programs . After all ,  our national intelligence work is existential .",

            "input": "CIA Report, Funding the Government: How can Obama, Congress defy the Constitution? When the government is waving at us with its right hand, so to speak, it is the government's left hand that we should be watching . Just as a magician draws your attention to what he wants you to see so you will not observe how his trick is performed , last week presented a textbook example of public disputes masking hidden deceptions . Here is what happened . Last week was dominated by two huge news stories . One was the revelation by the Senate Intelligence Committee of torture committed by CIA agents and contractors on 119 detainees in the post-9/11 era -- 26 of whom were tortured for months by mistake . In that revelation of anguish and error were the conclusions by CIA agents themselves that their torture had not produced helpful information . President Obama acknowledged that the CIA had tortured , yet he directed the Department of Justice not to prosecute those who tortured and those who authorized it . The other substantial news story was the compromise achieved by Congress and the White House to fund the government through the end of September 2015 . That legislation, which is 2,000 pages in length, was not read by anyone who voted for it . It spends a few hundred billion dollars more than the government will collect in tax revenue . The compromise was achieved through bribery ; members of Congress bought and sold votes by adding goodies (in the form of local expenditures of money borrowed by the federal government) to the bill that were never debated or independently voted upon and were added solely to achieve the votes needed for passage . This is how the federal government operates today . Both parties participate in it . They have turned the public treasury into a public trough . Hidden in the law that authorized the government to spend more than it will collect was a part about funding for the 16 federal civilian intelligence agencies . And hidden in that was a clause, inserted by the same Senate Intelligence Committee that revealed the CIA torture, authorizing the National Security Agency to gather and retain nonpublic data for five years and to share it with law enforcement and with foreign governments . \"Nonpublic data\" is the government's language referring to the content of the emails, text messages, telephone calls, bank statements, utility bills and credit card bills of nearly every innocent person in America -- including members of Congress, federal judges, public officials and law enforcement officials . I say \"innocent\" because the language of this legislation -- which purports to make lawful the NSA spying we now all know about-- makes clear that those who spy upon us needn't have any articulable suspicion or probable cause for spying . The need for articulable suspicion and probable cause has its origins in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , which was written to prohibit what Congress just authorized . That amendment was a reaction to the brutish British practice of rummaging through the homes of American colonists, looking for anything that might be illegal . It is also a codification of our natural right to privacy . It requires that if the government wants nonpublic data from our persons, houses, papers or effects, it must first present evidence of probable cause to a judge and then ask the judge for a search warrant . Probable cause is a level of evidence that is sufficient to induce a judge into concluding that it is more likely than not that the place to be examined contains evidence of crimes . In order to seek probable cause, the government must first have an articulable suspicion about the person or place it has targeted . Were this not in the law, then nothing would stop the government from fishing expeditions in pursuit of anyone it wants to pursue . And fishing expeditions turn the presumption of liberty on its head . The presumption of liberty is based on the belief that our rights are natural to us and that we may exercise them without a permission slip from the government and without its surveillance . Until last week, that is . Last week, Congress, by authorizing the massive NSA spying to continue and by authorizing the spies to share what they have seized with law enforcement, basically permitted the fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment was written to prevent . How can the president and Congress defy the Constitution, you might ask? Hasn't every member of the government taken an oath to uphold the Constitution? Doesn't the Constitution create the presidency and the Congress? How can politicians purport to change it? The answers to these questions are obvious, as is the belief of most of those in government that they can write any law and regulate any behavior and ignore the Constitution they have sworn to uphold whenever they want , so long as they can get away with it .",

            "input": "Punishment, not apology after CIA torture report. What a dark day for the United States . Five years and nine months after Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kit Bond, the chair and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced a review of the CIA's detention and interrogation programme in the so-called \"war on terror\", the 500-page executive summary of that report has been made publicly available . Its conclusions are shocking . As Feinstein explained in an interview with the Los Angeles Times at the weekend,\"We have to get this report out. Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again.\" Let us hope so - and let us also hope that senior officials in the Bush administration, as well as senior CIA personnel, will eventually be held accountable for their actions . The CIA's torture programme, initiated almost immediately after the 9/11 attacks, remained a closely guarded secret for many years . An early revelation was a June 2004 leak of a memo which purported to redefine torture so that it could be used by the CIA . The memo was written by John Yoo, a lawyer in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) , who was close to Dick Cheney . The CIA's \"black sites\" in Europe were not publicly exposed until November 2005 . The Bush administration still refused to openly acknowledge the programme until September 2006 , when then President George W Bush announced that, with the arrival of 14 \"high-value detainees\" at Guantanamo from various \"black sites\", the programme he had denied the existence of until that time had now closed down . That statement, we subsequently learned, was not entirely true , as a few other prisoners arrived at Guantanamo from CIA custody in 2007 and 2008 , but the torture report provides conclusive proof . \"By March 2006,\" the report states,\"the programme was operating in only one country. The CIA last used its enhanced interrogation techniques on November 8, 2007. The CIA did not hold any detainees after April 2008.\" After the arrival of the \"high-value detainees\" at Guantanamo, numerous attempts were made to pierce the veil of secrecy that surrounded the programme . In 2007, Swiss Senator Dick Marty published an influential report for the Council of Europe about secret prisons and rendition in Europe . In February 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden admitted that three \"high-value detainees\" had been subjected to waterboarding . In December 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee published a powerful report about how the policies for dealing with prisoners in the \"war on terror\" had developed - including detailed analysis of how the US military's SERE programme (intended to train US personnel to resist torture if captured by a hostile enemy) had been reverse-engineered for the \"war on terror\" . In April 2009, harrowing interviews with the 14 \"high-value detainees\", conducted by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, were leaked , and in August 2009 an internal CIA report from 2004 into the agency's detention and interrogation policies after 9/11 was released containing details of how one prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (one of the three men waterboarded, along with Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad), was physically abused and threatened with a gun and power drill while hooded at a \"black site\" in Thailand . In 2010 I wrote a detailed analysis of the secret detention programme for a UN study , in which I sought to ascertain the identities of the 94 \"ghost prisoners\" in CIA custody - including 28 subjected to \"enhanced interrogation\"  - who were referred to in a memo from 2005 by OLC lawyer Steven G Bradbury that was released by the Obama administration in April 2009 . Another major report, by the Constitution Project, was published in 2013 . And yet , although some of the gruesome facts about the torture programme were known , the Senate Intelligence Committee's report provides far more . In its \"Findings and Conclusions\", for example, the report states :. There are many more examples . The report states :. In addition , \"sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours\" , and although some \"experienced disturbing hallucinations\", in at least two cases the CIA continued its abuse . These examples - and many more in the summary - demonstrate clearly the committee's conclusion that the interrogations \"were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others\" . Perhaps more importantly, however, the committee also concludes that torture was \"not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees\", that the CIA made \"inaccurate claims\" about the \"effectiveness\" of the programme in an attempt to justify it and that it led to friction with other agencies that endangered national security, as well as providing false statements that led to costly and worthless wild goose chases . The report also concludes that non-approved techniques were used widely , and that \"[a]t least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without authorisation from CIA headquarters\", and that \"multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorisation, or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorised to use them\" . The committee was also critical of the central role played by two contract psychologists from the SERE programme , even though neither of them \"had any experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialised knowledge of al-Qaeda, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise\" . The committee also concluded that Steven Bradbury's numbers were wrong, and that the CIA \"detained at least 119 individuals, of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques\" . Moreover ,  of these 119 \"at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard\" in the still-secret Bush administration memorandum establishing the programme in September 2001 . In the days and weeks to come, there will be concerted efforts by the CIA and by former Bush administration officials to defend their actions , but the report makes clear that any kind of defence is untenable . Crimes were committed, authorised at the highest level of the US government , and , although Obama came into office in 2009 expressing \"a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards\" , that is not acceptable . The Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report - all 6,700 pages of it, costing $40m and involving an analysis of more than six million pages of classified documents - must be the trigger not just for an airing of apologies, but for those who instigated and authorised the torture programme to be held accountable - up to and including President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .",

In so doing, they surely saved her life . At the conclusion of oral arguments, the high court took just minutes to determined that state officials were right to take custody of the girl known in court documents only as \"Cassandra C \" and force her to undergo life-saving treatment . No thanks to her mother . Jackie Fortin had encouraged her 17-year-old daughter's desire to refuse chemotherapy . She naively pronounced,\"my daughter is not going to die.\" As if wishing it could make it come true . Sadly, both mother and daughter were wrong . They were in denial . If they got their way , Cassandra would die . It was the equivalent of suicide . I wonder how her mother would feel then? Cassandra has advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma which attacks and consumes the body's immune system . Her doctors say chemotherapy treatment will give her an 85 percent chance of survival . Excellent odds . Yet, the teenager refused, saying she did not want to \"poison\" her body with chemo . How does that make sense to a rational mind? Let's employ Cassandra's own tortured terminology and logic . Does she not realize that her body is already being poisoned by the rapidly multiplying cancer in her lymph system? Untreated , it will quickly spread until it kills her . That is what her doctors predict . Reliable statistics from the National Cancer Institute prove they are right . Chemotherapy can save her . Chemicals are introduced into the diseased body to attack the cancer cells . You can call it a \"poison\" if you want , but a more accurate term is curative . Yes, the chemicals also harm other normal cells . To that extent they are a poison, of sorts, producing painful and unpleasant side effects . But once the body recovers and is free of the cancer cells, the chemicals are gone . Thus , if chemo is a poison , it is not normally a lethal one . The cancer which is ravaging Cassandra's body surely is . If , by using the term \"poison,\" Cassandra means she does not want to endure the side effects of nausea, vomiting, hair loss and exhaustion cond , she is being myopic . The final stages of untreated lymphoma are far more extreme and painful . Cassandra's disdain for the treatment that will likely save her young life is, perhaps, the best evidence that she was not mature enough to make a wise and informed decision on her own . But then again, neither was her mother . Which is why the state of Connecticut stepped in . As an adult, Fortin, is presumed to be competent under the law to make decisions for her daughter, a minor . However ,  Fortin's aberrant judgment in rejecting the treatment that could save Cassandra's life and her concomitant belief that her daughter would somehow, miraculously, not succumb to an insidious, fatal illness... called that legal presumption into serious doubt . There is also evidence that Fortin ignored obvious signs of her daughter's malignant disease at an early stage, failed to seek prompt and continuing medical attention, and has been unduly influencing Cassandra's negative reaction to treatment . The court records suggest a domineering mother with an abiding distrust of medicine, and a daughter fearful of running afoul of her mother's wishes . To deny a child beneficial, life-sustaining treatment constitutes child neglect . States have a duty to protect children from abuse and neglect . Courts rarely hesitate to step in where a child's life is in danger . Thus , the state was correct to intervene and the lower court was equally correct to remove the mother as unfit . Fortunately, the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed and did the right thing . Time is on Cassandra's side . The fact that she is 9 months away from turning 18 years old may, in the end, have saved her life . It gave the high court an excuse to adhere strictly to the law as it relates to protecting minors . Those 9 months will also give doctors valuable time to complete her therapy and give her a new chance at a full and happy life . As for her mother, Jackie Fortin? She will have ample time to wrestle with her conscience .",

INDIANAPOLIS  - If success at the state level were enough to recommend someone for president of the United States , Gov  Mike Pence of Indiana would be among the frontrunners for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination . According to the governor's office, Pence has \"signed into law $643 million in annual tax relief : That includes: $313 million for hardworking Hoosiers, thanks to last year's 5 percent income tax reduction, the largest state tax cut in Indiana history.\" In addition ,  the state corporate tax rate was reduced from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent, making it the third lowest in the country and contributing to Indiana's increase in the labor force , which, Pence's office says, has grown by more than 51,000 over the past year, five times the national growth rate . It helps to have large majorities of one's party in the legislature , but Pence consults and has good relationships with Democrats , who frequently vote with the Republican majority because his programs work . Sitting with the governor in his high-ceiling office beneath portraits of two Indiana governors who became presidents of the United States-- William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison  -- Pence tells me he is focused on the upcoming legislative session, which is expected to last four months, and won't think seriously about running for president until the session ends . Then , he says,\"We'll probably take some time as a family to reflect and pray and make decisions about our future.\" In his mind, Pence may have already crafted a winning scenario . He may be focused on his state , but he thinks a lot about the country , which he served for 10 years as a congressman . A former Democrat (like his ideological mentor Ronald Reagan), Pence sees a need to transform his party's image : \"The Republican Party has become just the other party to Washington solutions . We have to get back to advancing state- based solutions and reforms . We must be relentlessly optimistic.\" He paraphrases a Reagan line:\"' Why shouldn't we dream great dreams, after all we're Americans .' There was a confidence and optimism I think our party would do well to repair to . ... There' s a lot wrong with our national government , but we've got to stop confusing our national government with our nation.\" That's a good line for a stump speech . Pence wants to move from opposing bad ideas in Washington, to focusing on the success records in many states . For example , Pence's education agenda includes a goal of taking children in underperforming schools and putting them in good schools : \"By the year 2020, I want 100,000 more Indiana students in high- quality schools than we have today . Today, we have 105,000 kids who are in underperforming or failing schools.\" He wants to fix traditional schools, pay good teachers more, giving bonuses to the best, and expand vocational education to every high school in the state . \"We have the largest education voucher program in America . I want to expand that by lifting the cap and encouraging more private investment.\" Indiana also has 75 charter schools . Pence declines an invitation to comment on former Gov  Jeb Bush's recent remarks about having to lose the primary in order to win the general election , which many conservatives view as an attack on the party's base . If Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic Party's presidential nominee , I asked, is she beatable? Pence answers indirectly, saying he thinks 2016 will be the first foreign policy election since 1980 and that as a former secretary of state, Clinton will have some advantages . That's why he thinks the eventual GOP nominee should do as George W  Bush did in 2000 : name a group of advisers with strong foreign policy credentials to advise him during a campaign and , if he is successful , some might serve in his administration . Mike Pence is a model of humility and restraint . While some characterize Obama as a failed president , Pence will only label his tenure \"disappointing.\" That in itself is in sharp contrast to the hubris, narcissism and self-awareness of Obama . Humility, coupled with a proven track record of success and more confidence in the states and the people, is what's needed at the national level . Mike Pence could be the one to bring it .",

It has been a few years since the sudden death of the Sun of the Nation, Marshal Kim Jong-il which made his third son, Kim Jong-un, then in his late 20s, the supreme leader of North Korea . Three years is the length of the traditional mourning period that Koreans are supposed to observe after the death of their father or sovereign . Thus ,  now is the time to make some observations about Kim's North Korea . What has remained the same, and what has changed since December 2011? The dawn of Kim's rule was marked by intense purges of his father's top dignitaries . In December 2011, during his father's funeral, Kim walked next to his father's hearse in the company of three top generals and four top civilian officials . Three years on, none of these people have their jobs : At least one of them was executed , while all but one have disappeared without a trace . Kim's decision to arrest and execute Chang Song-taek, his aunt's husband, long the \"grey eminence\" of Pyongyang politics, was a dramatic signal to the elite . The sorry fate of Chang was meant to show that nobody is immune from the wrath of the supreme leader . These purges were obviously necessary to start changing the country , since Kim's policies will be very different from those of his father and grandfather . So far, the most important changes can be seen in the field of economic management . From late 2012, the North Korean government began to implement reforms which are remarkably similar to what China did in the early days of Deng Xiaoping, around 1980 . Farmers, who were hitherto government employees with a fixed salary, are now given a certain percentage of the harvest, and have predictably started to feel motivated . As a result, the food situation has improved markedly . In industry, a slow-motion switch from a Leninist, centrally planned economy to markets has been initiated as well . The unofficial private economy, far more advanced in North Korea than most imagine, is now quietly encouraged . There is no sign of relaxation in the political sphere, however . Kim has launched a massive crackdown on illegal border movements, effectively closing North Korea's border with China  - which had remained porous for decades . He has also done much to root out the penchant that many North Koreans have recently developed for smuggled foreign TV shows, especially South Korean soap operas and films . Such concerns are not merely motivated by paranoia, regardless of what the international media says . The supreme leader knows that his position is precarious, and that tightening the screws of social control and surveillance may help him prolong his rule . North Korea under Kim remains as stubborn in its nuclear ambitions as it was under his father . Having seen the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the popular rebellion against Libya's Gaddafi that was indirectly assisted by western might, North Korean decision-makers have every reason to want to continue to advance their nuclear weapons potential . At the same time ,  there has also been a truly unprecedented crisis in Sino- North Korean relations . In the last years of Kim Jong-il, China was North Korea's major sponsor and trade partner . Now things are different . The Chinese and North Korean media (strictly controlled by the government in both countries) have exchanged thinly veiled verbal attacks , while the Chinese government has frozen all Beijing-sponsored infrastructure projects in North Korea - including, for example, a new bridge over the Yalu River . The North Korean government under Kim has shown hitherto unprecedented interest in foreign investment, as long as this investment comes from sources other than China . At present, the young marshal has pinned his hopes on Russia - currently itself on a collision course with the West . North Korean leaders obviously believe that Russia under Vladimir Putin will behave like the Soviet Union once did and shower North Korea with aid grants as a reward for Pyongyang's militant anti-Americanism . Such hopes are misplaced , but it will take some time before Pyongyang's decision-makers realise the sad truth . There is little doubt that Kim wants to be popular and loved by his people, and perhaps sincerely cares about the wellbeing of the North Korean populace , though he might have rather eccentric ideas on what constitutes such wellbeing . Under his watch, the North Korean government has spent a significant part of its meagre resources on building all kinds of entertainment facilities, including an elite ski resort, a number of water parks and even a dolphinarium . Kim's North Korea is increasingly a place quite different from the North Korea of his father . It is moving towards a more efficient economy, but also towards more internal repression . It is more prone to erratic changes in domestic policy and more eccentric in many regards . But ,  of course , for the foreseeable future it is going to remain a nuclear and authoritarian regime, run by the Kim family and a small hereditary elite : This is not negotiable, irrespectively of what the outside world thinks and does .",

            "input": "A defining moment for the French right. France lost five of its most prominent political cartoonists yesterday . For decades, they had mocked the powerful, the sacred, the dictators, and all those who believed themselves above criticism . These cartoonists felt there was no better way to fight fundamentalism than through derision and laughter . The late Charb, Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief, was killed, evoking the words of Spanish republican icon Dolores Ibarruri, who was known to boast:\"I'd rather die standing than live kneeling.\" It is this very impertinence, this freedom to rebel against ideologies, structures and hierarchies through art and literature, that has been targeted . France is known for its triad \"liberty, equality, brotherhood\" engraved at the helm of every school, on all official buildings . This motto attributed to French theologian and writer Francois Fenelon at the end of the 17th century was popularised during the French Revolution , when popular unrest toppled religious and authoritative powers . This philosophy was central to Charlie Hebdo's editorial line and promoted by Charb, known for his firm leftist stands, and for advocating for more justice and wealth redistribution . Yet ,  the likely beneficiaries of this heinous act will be the very opponents of this libertarian and humanist stance . A few hours after the events, extreme right leader Marine Le Pen immediately seized the opportunity to unleash her short-sighted Islamophobic attacks . While spontaneous gatherings and demonstrations took place across the country to show the country's grief and support for the victims , Le Pen dissuaded her supporters from participating . She later set conditions for taking part in the Republican march organised for next Sunday . This political move is unsurprising from Le Pen . Her political platform is built upon her populist claims of the threats stemming from Islam and more generally, from immigrants . She built her political success on the rise of communitarianism and the growing rifts and dissent in French society . A solidarity march gathering all religions and all sectors of the population in favour of freedom of the press does not play to her political hand . While the French Muslim authorities have called on every mosque in the country to strongly condemn this act of terrorism and encourage participation in the march , Le Pen would rather continue her own crusade alone and capitalise on growing French fears . She would rather call for\"open war on Islam\" than demonstrate with the 99.99 percent of French Muslims who respect the Republican law . Her traditional supporters, such as skinhead groups \"Riposte Laique\" and \"Bloc identitaire\", have called for a \"civil war in the country against Islamisation\" . But they have failed to mention that Ahmed Merabet, the brave policeman who tried to stop the terrorists and was shot dead in the street, was himself Muslim and defended French Republican values through a lifetime of service in the police force . While traditional parties call for national unity in a peaceful march , Le Pen's supporters blow on the ashes of societal discontent , encouraging retaliation against this act of terrorism . Mosques were reportedly shot at in Le Mans at midnight , a kebab restaurant was bombed in Villefranche . Barbary is answered by stupidity . Ironically, Le Pen will likely benefit from the fears and shock after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a magazine that has been one of her strongest opponents . Le Pen can hardly call for the protection of freedom of the press when her own party has regularly tried to limit it by selecting the newspapers and networks who could cover her meetings and ask her questions . Two years ago, her own father vehemently criticised Charlie Hebdo , calling the publication a rag after it ridiculed his political party . Marine Le Pen herself then officially asked for the resignation of any journalist that would show Charlie Hebdo's cover on national TV . Similarly ,  Nicolas Sarkozy is an awkward defender of Charlie Hebdo . First ,  his strategy to win back the presidency in 2017 is to stress on the inability of Francois Hollande to fill the shoes of president, constantly criticising his lack of authority and charisma . The current terrorist crisis is a defining moment for Hollande who might now well prove his capacity to unite a grieving society . More importantly, Sarkozy can hardly support Charlie Hebdo and freedom of the press when he himself personally demanded the resignation of one of its cartoonists in 2008 . At the time Sarkozy was furious that the magazine had published a cartoon mocking his son Jean Sarkozy , whose ambition dwarves the legendary one of his father . Charlie Hebdo described Jean Sarkozy's marriage to a very wealthy Jewish heiress as an attempt to secure his future after failing to finish his university degree . Nicolas Sarkozy managed to obtain the dismissal of the cartoonist Sine and put him on trial for anti-Semitism . Ironically, his colleagues were not so fortunate yesterday when faced with fundamentalists claiming Charlie Hebdo was an enemy of the Muslim prophet .",

            "input": "Defusing Taliban publicity. Journalists in Afghanistan have decided for the second time this year to curtail their reporting on Taliban attacks as a means of reducing the impact of their message . The first such collective action was taken during the presidential elections when the Taliban were completely boycotted . This is a strategic decision according to Fahim Dashty, the chief executive of Afghanistan's National Journalists Union (ANJU) . The decision follows the recent heavy escalation of attacks in Kabul . \"Our media is saturated with images of Taliban attacks,\" says a joint press statement by ANJU, and the media watchdog, Nai . \"Taliban spokesman Zabihula Mujahid is active on TV and social media round the clock, he is in every home 24 hours a day, we need to confront his messages,\" says Nai's director, Sediqulah Tauhidi . Afghan journalists feel they need support from policy makers and the international community alike . \"We will be calling on the new president, Ashraf Ghani, to consider blocking the sites that Taliban use for their publicity,\" says Dashty . Confronting publicity . The call by journalists in Afghanistan echoes international concerns about the need to confront publicity by armed groups such as ISIL, and the attempts in several countries including Britain to block these groups' use of the internet and social media to advertise, publicise and recruit . British Home Secretary Theresa May acknowledged the extent of the problem in her latest policy speech:\"We need a counter terrorism strategy that is comprehensive and coherent.\" Among the measures to curb the activities of the Islamist terror groups she introduced restrictions on the use of the internet . \"We are engaged in a struggle that is fought on many fronts,\" she said, naming terrorist groups in several parts of the world including Afghanistan . Police and intelligence agencies will be given new powers to track down those who plot terrorist attacks over the internet . \"They enable the authorities to limit a subject's access to telephones and the internet,\" she said . Terrorist attacks have been complex but many are used for sending a specific message either to the local population or to the international community . Once these messages are turned into images on TV and internet across the world their impact is amplified . Broader audience . According to UN counterterrorism research, terrorist-related propaganda hosted on popular websites containing user-generated content has the potential to reach a significantly broader audience than content on traditional specialised websites, bulletin boards and web forums , which generally appeal to a self- selected group of individuals . \"Their sophisticated use of the internet and social media means they have a significant propaganda reach across the world,\" said the British home secretary . \"The scourge of ISIL should not mean that the Taliban are forgotten or seen as the milder terror group,\" stresses Dashty . There are serious reservations when British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond states at the opening of the London Conference on Afghanistan that \"The terrorist threat from the region has been substantially reduced,\" when there are almost daily attacks in Kabul . \"Taliban are blocking the fledgling democracy that has been built over the last decade,\" says Nai director . \"They are attacking our liberty, they are targeting freedom of speech, they are targeting press freedom and we must have a counter offensive.\" Dashty says as journalists we must ask ourselves whether in our endeavour to provide information we are turning into communication channels at the service of the Taliban . The arguments are not straightforward . On the one hand , the media needs to report to inform the population and on the other hand , reporting terrorist attacks has increasingly become publicity for armed extremist groups . On the one hand freedom of speech and civil liberties should be preserved at all cost , and on the other hand ,  terrorist messages have traumatised societies and increased militant recruitment around the world . Credible counter-narrative . These issues must be discussed in depth and collectively around the world . There is a need for coordinating a credible counter narrative both at the local and the global level to confront the banality and cruelty of terrorist messages . Take for example their claim, believed even by some analysts, that they are fighting to save Muslims while facts tell us that they have killed tens of thousands over the years . Since 2009, there have been over 17,000 civilian deaths in Afghanistan alone as documented by the UN - 75 percent as a result of Taliban attacks . Or the contradictions in the Taliban claim that they want foreign forces out while targeting British interests one month after British forces left Afghanistan, or inviting foreign Islamist fighters and al-Qaeda to set up camp in Afghanistan during their rule . \"Confusion and contradictions among the various terrorist voices\" are common according to the latest State Department report on terrorism . Journalists, media analysts, communication experts and policy makers need to come together to discuss how best to build a framework for a new counterterrorism narrative that at the same time reveals the falsities of terrorist assertions . Once formulated, it could then be used as any public service broadcast messages woven into drama serials, discussions, debates and news coverage alike . The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, which created a counterterrorism task force, says that despite increasing international recognition of the threat posed by terrorists' use of the internet,\"there is currently no universal instrument specifically addressing this pervasive facet of terrorist activity\" . 'Psychological security' . The joint statement by ANJU and Nai calls on the media and the reporters in Afghanistan to refrain from competition over who shows more pictures of the gruesome Taliban attacks . It says that the \"unprecedented\" frequency of the footage shown on TV and social media have undermined the \"psychological security\" of the nation . \"Our first boycott of the Taliban was successful,\" says Dashty . \"Attacks were reduced and over 60 percent of the population took part in the elections.\" He says they would really benefit if journalists in the West supported their campaigns, especially those who frequently report from Afghanistan . \"We would also welcome an international framework that sets an example for us,\" says Dashty . A coordinated global plan to counter terrorist media propaganda would be a useful tool for journalists in areas adversely affected by terrorist attacks . Attacks plotted on the World Wide Web need an appropriate worldwide media response .",

            "input": "Did Coltrane say 'Allah Supreme'? \"A Love Supreme\" is widely recognised as John Coltrane's masterwork, and a milestone recording in the history of jazz . Many an aficionado came to jazz through that classic album- a 32-minute-long composition organised around a four-note bass routine . The manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's treasures ; the saxophone that Coltrane used to record the piece was recently gifted to the Smithsonian Museum ; and former US President Bill Clinton, a saxophonist and Coltrane fan, is said to have \"A Love Supreme\" set as the ringtone for when Hillary calls . This week marks the 50th anniversary of \"A Love Supreme\"  . Recorded on December 9, 1964, the composition is being celebrated worldwide in concerts, festivals, academic symposia and even at churches . The Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church - founded in 1969 by two clerics who saw Coltrane perform live in the San Francisco, and experienced a \"sound baptism\"- celebrated \"A Love Supreme\" mass on December 8, in San Francisco's iconic Grace Cathedral . The recording has long been understood to be a deeply spiritual, even devotional, piece . Its four phases - \"Acknowledgement\", \"Resolution\", \"Pursuance\" and \"Psalms\" - reflect what Coltrane described as a \"spiritual awakening\" in his overcoming of drug and alcohol problems . All praise belongs to God . Yet ,  what was the nature of that \"spiritual awakening\"? The conventional view is that by 1964, Coltrane had moved away from his Methodist upbringing, adopting a \"pan-religious\" outlook with a particular interest in Eastern mysticism . In spite of that , \"A Love Supreme\" is still described as laden with Biblical symbolism: the title \"Psalm\", and the rising cadences, reminiscent of black preachers' style, are offered as evidence that Coltrane was still rooted in Christianity . But ask one of the jazzmen or Muslim elders who knew Coltrane, and you get a different answer . The saxophonist Yusef Lateef, who died at the age of 93 earlier this year, worked closely with Coltrane between 1963 and 1966 . In his autobiography , \"A Gentle Giant\", Lateef says:\"The prayer that John wrote in 'A Love Supreme' repeats the phrase 'All praise belongs to God no matter what' several times . This phrase has the semantics of the al-Fatiha, which is the first chapter or sura of the Holy Quran . The Arabic transliteration is 'al-Humdulilah ...' Since all faithful Muslims say the al-Fatiha five times a day or more, it is reasonable to assume that John heard this phrase from [his Muslim wife] Sister Naima many times.\" Lateef is referring to the poem Coltrane wrote and included in the liner notes of the album . Coltrane wrote:\"No matter what... It is with God. He is gracious and merciful\" and ends with \"All praise to God...\" What Lateef and others have noted is that \"gracious and merciful\" is a translation of \"rahman raheem\", the opening lines of the Fatiha . Moreover , say the elders, when Coltrane begins chanting the album's title for half a minute it sounds like a Sufi breathily repeating \"Allah supreme\" . The relationship between Islam and jazz is almost a century-old . It was in the 1920s that the Ahmadiyya movement, a heterodox Islamic movement that emerged in 19th century India, began sending missionaries to US cities, building a substantial following among African Americans in the decades to come . In a trend that still intrigues historians and music critics, after World War II, scores of jazz musicians embraced Ahmadi Islam . When Coltrane arrived in Philadelphia in 1943, the Muslim presence in the \"city of brotherly love\" would rattle the young man . As he told an interviewer in 1958:\"This Muslim thing came up. I got introduced to that. And that kind of shook me.\" Ongoing debate in Philadelphia . The saxophonist was surrounded by Muslims : his drummer Rashied Ali was Muslim, as was his pianist McCoy Tyner (Suleiman Saud), and saxophonist Lateef . Coltrane then married Naima Grubbs, an observant Muslim . Even Coltrane's band members have pondered his relationship to Islam . If Lateef suspected that Coltrane's art was influenced by the Quran , the drummer Rashied Ali thought that the saxophonist was \"a real country boy\" and that \"he was into being a Muslim and everything like that\" . \"Back then jazz and Islam were intertwined - the first time I heard the adhan on Temple University radio, I thought it was a Nina Simone song,\" says Imam Nadim Ali, a celebrated jazz deejay and community leader who spent his youth in Philadelphia . \"Artists were deeply influenced by Islam - sometimes publicly in their art, sometimes privately.\" It's not inconceivable that \"A Love Supreme\" could have been inspired by the Quran . After all , as the elders will observe,\"Celebration\", that great funk hit by Kool & the Gang, was inspired by a Quranic sura . \"The initial idea came from the Quran,\" says Ronald Bell (Khalis Bayyan), the group's saxophonist and musical arranger . \"I was reading the passage, where God was creating Adam, and the angels were celebrating and singing praises . That inspired me to write the basic chords, the line, 'Everyone around the world, come on, celebration'.\" This song inspired by Islam - and released in 1980 - would become an international hit heard at ball games and political rallies in the US, and ironically was played by the Reagan administration on February 7, 1981, to welcome home the hostages held by students in the Islamic Republic of Iran . One also hears the argument that Coltrane wanted to title his composition \"Allah Supreme\"- instead of \"A Love Supreme\" - but was worried about a political backlash, given the ongoing conflict in the Middle East . The mass conversion of African Americans to Islam unsettled many European Americans and tensions rippled into the jazz world . Jazz critics would often dismiss the converts as \"strange\" and \"confused\" . Young converts . In his memoir, Dizzy Gillespie candidly describes the pressures that faced young converts in the jazz world . \"The movement among jazz musicians towards Islam created quite a stir, especially with the surge of the Zionist movement,\" writes Dizzy Gillespie in\"To Be or Not to Bop\" . \"A lot of friction arose between Jews and Muslims, which took the form of a semi-boycott in New York of jazz musicians with Muslim names... Near the end of the '40s, the newspapers really got worried about whether I'd convert to Islam.\" Gillespie was, as he would say,\"intrigued\" by \"the beautiful sound of the word Quran and discussed Islam extensively with Lateef . But in 1948, in a shoot for a feature story with Life magazine, Gillespie was asked to pose shirtless, cross-legged, and bowing with his arms outstretched . The magazine published the piece and claimed (falsely) that the trumpeter was bowing in prayer towards Mecca . The media ruckus that ensued about the King of Bebop's abandonment of Christianity incensed Gillespie. He would eventually become a Bahai.\" Political and racial pressures still bear heavily on black and Muslim artists (especially hip hop artists) today . And we may never know what Coltrane had in mind when he composed his masterpiece . But as the US celebrates and and tries to mainstream figures from the turbulent 1960s, voices from the communities that produced the likes of Coltrane, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, should be heard - especially as the domestic and foreign policies that pushed African Americans towards Islam a century ago are still with us . Hisham Aidi teaches at Columbia University . He is the author of the critically acclaimed Rebel Music: Race, Empire and the New Muslim Youth Culture, a study of black internationalism and global youth culture .",

            "input": "Diversity among police officers is key, but it won't solve the problems with policing. In Ferguson, Missouri, 50 of the 53 police officers are white in a city that is two-thirds African American . In Connecticut's state capital, Hartford, 66% of the police department is white but only 16% of the residents are . And these are just two examples: despite progress over the past 50 years, many police departments remain predominantly white in cities and towns where the majority of the population is nonwhite . There are some important exceptions to the disparity pattern . Several big city police departments are majority-black or majority-Hispanic (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Santa Fe and El Paso, for instance) , while others (such as Chicago) are so diverse that no single group comprises the majority . Yet for many other cities, the gap between the complexion of the police department and the local population is huge . Why does this matter? Do police officers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds act differently while on the job? Do they have different kinds of relationships with minority communities? Aren't all officers trained to do their jobs similarly and to treat all civilians the same regardless of race? Research shows that, in general in the US, there is not a strong correlation, let alone a causal relationship, between an officer's race and how officers treat members of the public when they respond to calls from civilians or stop and question them on the streets Statistics are, of course, not predictive of individual behavior , and studies of specific departments or communities vary . A 2004 study in Indianapolis (Indiana) and St  Petersburg (Florida) by Ivan Sun and Brian Payne, for example, found that black officers were more likely than white officers working in black neighborhoods to provide information, referrals to other agencies, and to treat residents respectfully , although the black officers were also more likely to use physical force against citizens in conflict situations . But ,  again, most studies find similarities overall in police behavior irrespective of officers' racial background . Shared training in the academy, as well as on-the-job socialization by fellow officers, results in more similarities than differences among officers when it comes to their policing activities, including similarities in how officers of all races treat white versus non-white citizens . So we should not view racial diversification on the force as a panacea for improving police treatment of minorities : instead if minority officers adopt majority attitudes about those they serve and protect , it might hardly help at all . A 2008 study in Baltimore, Maryland by Peter Moskos documented precisely this shared mentality among both white and black officers . But it can pay major dividends in other ways . In one poll of 1,791 Americans that I and a colleague conducted for our book, Race and Policing in America, more than 70% of blacks, Hispanics and whites in the United States believed that a city's police department should have a similar racial composition to the city . The same study found that very few blacks and Hispanics (only 5%) want most officers who work in their neighborhoods to be exclusively of the same race as the residents , and instead most people prefer to see racially- mixed teams of officers patrolling their streets . . Importantly, such diversity can help to build trust and confidence in the police : the more a police department reflects the composition of the local population, the higher the department's reputation among residents , which can provide a foundation to build further trust, coupled with other needed reforms . It also helps, in majority-black or majority-Hispanic cities, if the chief of police comes from that community as well because, as the public face of the department, he or she can allay suspicions when controversial incidents occur in a way that white police chiefs may not be able to do . A diverse police force can also help to decrease the sense that individuals are being stopped and questioned solely because of their race . This clearly applies when the officers and citizens are of the same race , but even encounters between white officers and minority citizens may be perceived as less racialized when the department has a critical mass of minority officers . A representative police force can, in other words, have symbolic benefits that enhance the overall status of a police department and also reduce the perception that actions, such as stops or searches, are based on racial profiling . Most police chiefs realize the advantages of a department that represents the local community , but there are big challenges in recruiting more minority officers . Many Hispanics and African Americans are reluctant to consider a career in law enforcement - not surprising, given the history of policing in America coupled with more recent events . Highly-publicized incidents like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York only make it more difficult for police departments to recruit minority officers . Recruiters can have some success, however, if they broaden their outreach efforts to include churches and community centers - and if there are pre- existing positive relationships between the police and residents in those minority neighborhoods where community policing has already taken root , which can be built on . Although troubled interactions between minorities and police garner most of the headlines, there are neighborhoods in American cities where working-class and middle-class black and Hispanic residents - including youths - have better relationships with the authorities than on average, as I found in a study of Washington DC neighborhoods . It is in these communities that the police can enhance their recruitment efforts and achieve at least some success . Racial diversification is one crucial ingredient in a larger program of reform that is required to improve police departments throughout the country . A representative police force is not a panacea - but it is a positive reform, and an achievable one .",

It's become a trend this year with so many families because as parents we want to teach kids about generosity . Moms and dads everywhere are using Christmas as an opportunity to get their kids thinking about serving others and giving to the less fortunate , rather than encouraging them to create monstrous Christmas lists describing all the things they want this season . Some parents are even \"cancelling\" Christmas for their kids, not giving any family members any gifts . But do we really need to cancel Christmas in order to foster a spirit of generosity in our kids? Wednesday I joined Lisa Henderson on \"Fox & Friends\" to debate this very question . Lisa has \"cancelled Christmas\" in her Utah home because , she says, her kids have become too entitled,\"acting so ungrateful\" and \"extremely disrespectful.\" So there will be no presents for Christmas , but , as she writes on her blog Overthebigmooon.com,\"There is a good possibility that Santa will be writing them a letter of how proud of them he is and perhaps put a few pieces of hard candy and an orange in their stockings.\" While I have great respect for what Lisa wants to accomplish , I disagree with her approach . Christmas should begin, not end, at home . We are already under immense pressure to purge Christmas from our culture . First nativity scenes in public places were under attack, now it's Christmas trees . Even saying\"Merry Christmas\" has taken a back seat to \"Happy Holidays.\" Cancelling Christmas and using letters from Santa to motivate our kids to be generous is not the answer . The answer is in putting the emphasis on the miracle not the material . And here's the good news . Even our gift giving can point to the miracle . So, yes, we give a few gifts to our kids . But we also give many gifts to the less fortunate . For example ,  we've taught our own kids that the gifts we give them at Christmas aren't based on whether they've been bad or good all year . The gifts we give them are free, unearned, underserved gifts , just like the gift of Jesus is a free, unearned, and underserved gift . This is a very tangible, concrete concept for kids to grasp . And when we serve and give to others, we teach our kids what Jesus said in Matthew 25:40 : \"Whatever you do for the least of your brothers and sisters, you do for me.\" So we give gifts to Jesus on his \"birthday\" by serving and loving and giving to others! This is how parents can infuse real meaning into Christmas -- not by refusing to celebrate it all together . Cancelling Christmas is simply not the key to fostering generosity in our kids . The key to fostering generosity in our kids is by making giving something we do all year round. By making it a lifestyle . And a lifestyle of giving springs from a deep well of gratitude for how Jesus first gave his life for us . We have to be so careful not to teach our kids that Christmas is about doing more, trying harder, and being better to be worthy of gifts . Christmas is about anticipating and celebrating the greatest gift that has already been given-- the unconditional love of God in the birth of Jesus Christ . Our focus shouldn't be on whether or not we have a tree overflowing with gifts, but on whether we have a home overflowing with love . His love . And if that's our starting place , we have a pretty good shot at getting Christmas, and all the 364 other days of the year, right .",

Liberty Institute is a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases . \"This sends a message to school districts that their natural allergic reaction to religion is misplaced, and not only is it wrong-- but it's also an egregious violation of the law,\" Sasser said . As I first reported, Tutka was working as a substitute teacher on Oct  12, 2013 , when he ran afoul of school policies . He told a straggling student at the end of a line, \"The first shall be last and the last shall be first.\" The student asked on a number of occasions where the line was from , and Tutka told him it was from the Bible . When he discovered the child did not have a Bible , Tutka gave him his personal copy . It was not all that unusual because Tutka is a member of Gideons International, a ministry known for providing Bibles to school children across the world . On Oct  18, Tutka was summoned to the principal's office , where he was accused of violating a school policy that bans the distribution of religious materials and another that directs teachers to be neutral when discussion religious material . He was fired on Jan  14 . Sasser said he hopes the school district will reinstate Tutka . \"If they don't do the right thing, they will face some serious consequences,\" he told me . \"They are going to be liable for damages.\" I reached out to George Chando, the superintendent of the Phillipsburg School District . He declined to return my call . My advice to him is to do the right thing , or Liberty Institute will go after him like a pit bull going after a pork chop . Sasser said the EEOC ruling should serve as a warning to other school districts around the nation . \"You can't just fire people because they happen to hand a Bible to somebody while they are at work,\" he said . Sasser said he believes the school district was out to get Walt because he is a Gideon . I obtained a copy of an email from Phillipsburg Middle School Assistant Principal John Stillo that suggest the school district had an issue with the well-known religious group . \"It has been brought to the administration's attention that Gideons may be near our campus to distribute literature to our students,\" Stillo wrote in a memo to the school's staff . \"Please make sure they DO NOT step foot onto our campus at any time. There will be added police and security presence at dismissal.\" Gideon International has a long history of providing Bibles to public school students , but many districts have banned the religious society in recent years . Ironically, the Gideons are welcome to distribute Bibles and deliver speeches in Russian schools . The Phillipsburg School District should rehire Walt . And it owes him a big apology . They waged a disgusting public war against this fine, upstanding man simply because he gave a child a Bible . Shame on you, Phillipsburg School District . Shame on you .",

            "input": "Expert: Blacks trust police more than whites do. Do blacks trust police more than whites do? Given the anger over events in Ferguson and New York City, the very question seems absurd . But it is not . Behind the polls and demonstrations, there is evidence that blacks trust police at least as much as whites do . The poll results are hardly surprising . A new Gallup poll confirms blacks place less confidence in police and the criminal justice system . Using survey data from 2006 through 2014, Gallup found 31 percentage points more blacks than whites believe black males are more likely to go to prison than white males primarily because of discrimination(50 percent versus 19 percent) . *7 percentage points more blacks believe the honesty and ethics of police are low/very low (17 percent versus 10 percent) . Similarly , a 2013 Pew Research Centersurvey reveals that 70 percent of blacks believed police treated whites better than blacks . By contrast, only 37 percent of whites agreed . But what people say and what they do are often different . And there are both victims and criminals in black communities . Victims may trust the police for the same reasons that criminals dislike them . Blacks are not a monolithic group: blacks who who have been through the criminal justice system as criminals could answer these questions quite differently than those who have relied on police as victims . The polls don't distinguish between these two groups . As Charles Barkley recently said:\"[Police] are the only thing in the ghetto between this place being the wild, wild west.\" Most violent crime victims don't report crimes to police . For example ,  only about half of rapes are reported to police . That has a lot to do with how victims believe they will be treated by the police . In the case of rape, victims who think that the police are unsympathetic to rape victims or are unlikely to solve the cases are even less likely to report rapes . If black victims really believe police are racist , why would they report the crime to the police? Blacks victims don't want other blacks locked up simply due to their race ; they want the criminals who actually committed the crime punished . Of course people are more likely to report crimes to police if they believe the police will solve them . Why waste time filling out forms and being interviewed if the crime isn't going to be solved? If blacks think police are incompetent or dishonest or just don't care , again there is little reason to turn to the police for help . Yet ,  blacks don't shy away from reporting crimes to the police . Data compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statisticsfrom 2008 to 2012 shows that blacks are actually more likely than whites to report violent crimes to the police-- 9 percentage points more likely than whites (54 percent to 45 percent) . Blacks consistently report violent crimes at a higher rate than whites do . That applies to all income groups as well as for victims living in urban and suburban areas . This higher rate of reporting is true in areas where blacks face higher violent crime rates than whites and also when the reverse is true . The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that whites who are below 200 percent of the poverty level face a higher violent crime rate than blacks with the same income , yet blacks still report those crimes at a higher rate . For incomes above 200 percent of poverty, blacks are more frequent victims of violent crime , but again they are still more likely to report them . On average, blacks are victims of violent crime at much higher rates than whites , but the gap isn't as large as many people think . Typically, crime rate comparisons are in terms of the FBI crime data-- data relying on the number of crimes reported to police . But , as we have just noted , that is misleading , because blacks report violent crimes at higher rates . While the FBI crime numbers show blacks to have a 40 percent higher violent crime rate , the actual difference is about 30 percent . When it comes to crime, the demonstrations and pundits don't reflect how most blacks feel most of the time . There appears to be a silent majority of blacks who trust the police . Many blacks may get angry about particular cases in the news , but when they have to turn to someone for help, they turn to the police . Blacks apparently trust the police to do their job more frequently than whites do . John R  Lott, Jr  is a columnist for FoxNews.com .

            "input": "Do you really think your fat joke about Chris Christie is funny? New Jersey governor Chris Christie's weight - and whether it will impact any run for higher office- is once again the subject of discussion . (It comes up every year or so, and this year it's bound to come up every month or so.) On Sunday, Christie drew some people's ire by sitting with (ok, and hugging) the owner of the Dallas Cowboys , the team of which he is a fan . It doesn't actually seem to matter what Christie does, though : the kneejerk reaction to a hefty politician is always, inevitably, to insult his body , and now Christie's brother is even reacting to that reaction on Facebook . Fat people are described as gross and disgusting often enough that some of us loathe our own bodies to the point of self-injury . People think we're stupid and weak(or we'd just lose weight, right?) before they even talk to us . Fatness is classified as a disease in the United States . For his part, Christie, with his long history of being fat in the public eye, turned to a weight-loss surgery called lap band in his efforts to lose weight . In that last linked article, those close to him claimed it would humanize him in the eyes of the public - without recognizing that he is, in fact and in fat, already human . Our humanity hardly seems to matter to people going for the easy fat jokes . The truth is that fat people often have a more difficult time finding a good job . (Even, maybe especially, THE job .) You're less likely to get a promotion when your body doesn't match the image of a desirable employee . This bias - this discrimination - on the part of employers costs them top talent and actually winds up adding to stereotypes about us . It's hard for fat people to be perceived as hard workers when no one believes in our work ethic in the first place . But that's hardly the worst of the stereotypes: a couple of years ago, during a televised \"debate\" about fatness and fat acceptance with anti-obesity spokesperson MeMe Roth and model Crystal Renn, Roth finally gave in and called me stupid - using a single study that proclaim that fat people just have smaller brains and are therefore less intelligent . I laughed : it was a desperate attempt at an insult more than it was scientific discussion , but it was also honest - because it's definitely not the first time I've run across that conviction . Chris Christie, for all of his accomplishments, faces the same sort of discrimination as the fat person passed over for a job because of a hiring manager's bias - he's just facing it on a very intense and public level . People look at him and judge his body . They don't evaluate his intelligence based on his decisions ; they just assume he's stupid because he's fat . They ignore that it does actually take quite a lot of work to get elected as governor - politics is many things, but it's never a cake walk , and he's been involved since 1977 . And America has had fat presidents before - not many of them, but some rather notable ones, including Teddy Roosevelt . Chris Christie is- and this is another uncomfortable thing for someone with my own fairly radical political views to say- a complicated and intelligent politician . His actions are often well-considered (even when I screamingly disagree with them, which happens a lot) and even sometimes moderate, at least in the sense that he occasionally works across party lines ... and certainly across state lines when it comes to the NFL . But the fat jokes keep on coming :. How bout hittin the gym?? ... Christie won't back down , may watch Cowboys in Green Bay via @POLITICO for iOS http://t.co/Vn6SS5J4EB . US News & World Report's David Catanese even said that his brother's defense makes Christie looks bad because... he countered \"'crazy, pathetic posts' with one of his own\" . Apparently it's more presidential when you take the abuse about your body without anyone saying anything . And the fat jokes keep obscuring the actual conversation that needs to happen about Christie's political views , even as he remains cagey about running for the Republican nomination in 2016 . And if you're one of the people who'd rather insult his weight than talk about his politics , I have to ask: who is the less intelligent person, really? I don't think it's the fat guy .",

            "input": "Ferguson: Obama contines to undermine police departments around the country. As a response to the police shooting of Michael Brown, President Obama proposes $263 million for police training and body cameras . But more police training wouldn't have prevented the Brown shooting and the president's proposal plays into the hands of those who blame the police . President Obama has continually undermined police departments around the country , and his demand for more training fits that pattern . In 2009, he jumped to the conclusion that Cambridge, Massachusetts police \"acted stupidly\" when they arrested Henry Gates . He personalized the Trayvon Martin investigation in a way that to many implied the murder was radically motivated . And yet again last week, he emphasized that the anger to the verdict was \"an understandable reaction\" and blacks' distrust of police is \"rooted in realities.\" Nevertheless , whatever Obama implies, there was absolutely no evidence Officer Darren Wilson was motivated by race and he did exactly what he should have done . Brown's robbery of the convenience store, his decision to reach into the police car and punch Wilson while trying to take his gun, and finally Brown's decision to charge Wilson was what caused the teen's death . Under Missouri law, people can defend themselves with deadly force if they have a \"reasonable belief\" they need to use it to protect themselves against serious injury or death . Wilson claimed:\"I felt that another of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse... I've already taken two to the face and I didn't think I would, the third one could be fatal if he hit me right.\" When Brown later charged Wilson, despite repeated warnings to stop, Wilson worried that he no choice but to shoot Brown . But we don't have to take Wilson's word for what happened . The forensic evidence is overwhelmingly consistent with his story . There is no doubt that Brown reached in Wilson's car and hit him . Brown's DNA was found on Wilson's gun . Despite strong social pressure, three black witnesses confirmed Wilson's testimony . Police officers in America have a more dangerous job than many people realize and they behave remarkably well under these circumstances . In 2013, the assault rate for the general public in the United States was 229 per 100,000 people . But the rate police were assaulted that year was 9,300 per 100,000 officers- a rate 41 times higher . The only reason that police don't die at as high of a rate as people in other professions is because of their training and the fact that they are armed . Would you consider it \"dangerous\" to live in Detroit? After all ,  it has by far the highest assault rate in the country, at 1,257 per 100,000 people . But police are still 7.4 times more likely to be assaulted(=9,300/1,257) . Aggravated assaults don't necessarily involve injuries, just the attempt to cause serious bodily injury , but police are injured at a very high rate - 2,700 per 100,000 police officer . That is still much higher than the total assault data for civilians . This data also suggests that police are not actively looking for excuses to fire their weapons . The number of justifiable killings by police equals less than one percent of the assaults on police . Thus even when assaulted, police rarely resort to killing their attackers . As Ferguson is showing us, physical risks aren't the only risks that police face . On Saturday Officer Darren Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police department , fearing that protestors would use his continued presence to justify rioting . He is going to have a hard time getting a job , and he didn't get any severance pay . Who will hire him now? Surely no other police department will hire him . And, any company that would hire Wilson would fear the same protests . With Wilson facing civil suits and Attorney General Eric Holder's federal investigation still ongoing, the pressures on Officer Wilson are not likely to fade away anytime soon . It's safe to say that other police officers will be carefully watching what happens to Wilson . Yes, racism is despicable . And there have been abuses by police in the past . But 2014 isn't 1960 . Police have a difficult and dangerous job , and President Obama could help to calm things down if he and his administration weren't so quick to assume that police officers are the only ones at fault .

            "input": "Ferguson unrest: Make protesters pay for riot damage. No matter whose side you are on in the upheaval following the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, everyone should agree on the profound sadness of it all: sadness that an 18-year-old boy-man walked a path that led to his destruction; sadness that a police officer felt the need to defend himself by shooting another human being; sadness over the rioting and looting that followed a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Wilson; and for some, sadness that Wilson was not indicted . Much of the sadness was encapsulated in a sound bite I saw on one TV network . An African-American business owner, surveying the destruction of his store, plaintively asked,\"How am I going to feed my kids?\" I have an answer and it is one that should be applied to anyone convicted of riotous behavior, destruction of property and looting . It's called restitution . Restitution is an Old Testament concept instituted to remind people that when one harms another person, or steals or destroys property, someone else suffers and deserves reimbursement . It says the state is less a debtor than the victim of a crime . Restitution can also instill true moral guilt in a person , which can lead to genuine repentance and a decision by the perpetrator to make different choices leading to a better life . As the authorities in Ferguson examine videos that show the faces of many of the rioters and looters, charges will undoubtedly be filed . If convicted , the perpetrators should be forced to pay for the damage they caused . If they have jobs , their paychecks should be garnished . If they are on welfare , those checks should be forwarded to the businesses they destroyed . If they receive food-purchasing assistance , that assistance should be withdrawn . This should be the practice going forward . Those who destroy their communities will be required to pay back those harmed by their hooliganism and forfeit any government benefits they receive . This might require legislation , but politicians should have the public's support . A close relative of restitution is shaming . The convicted should be brought before those harmed by their behavior and publicly shamed . No one seems to be ashamed of anything nowadays , but shaming might help prevent future violence . Rioters and looters who are black could be shamed by law-abiding African-Americans . They can be asked,\"Is this why Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  marched and went to prison? Is this why he paid the ultimate price? Would he and other civil rights leaders dating back to Frederick Douglass be proud of your behavior today? Don't you owe them something better than this?\" Perhaps if people realize that their destructive behavior will cost them something, they think might twice about harming others and robbing them of a living . People from around the country are reportedly donating money to help those whose businesses were destroyed . That again demonstrates the generosity of Americans of all races and backgrounds . While donations will help, along with insurance , if it covers damage caused by violent protesters , the lawbreakers should still be required to take responsibility for their actions . In addition to whatever legal penalties might result, restitution and shaming should be part of the punishment . We've gotten away from personal responsibility and accountability, preferring instead to cast lawbreakers as \"victims,\" when the true victims are often ignored . Too often many blame others for their circumstances . Too often many feel entitled to what others have achieved through hard work and dedication . Too often too many feel justified in taking and destroying the property of others instead of working and building for themselves . If they don't feel ashamed , they should .",

            "input": "Five reasons why European Central Bank's QE won't save continent's dying economies. The European Central Bank has just announced a EUR60 billion ($69 billion) monthly government bond buying program--Quantitative Easing -- but that won't do much for the moribund continental economy . Central banks can print money to purchase government bonds to push up prices and lower interest rates on those assets and competing debt, such as corporate bonds and bank loans . In the United States, the Federal Reserve also bought billions in federally-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, such as those issued by Fannie Mae . The aim is to encourage more borrowing by businesses and homebuyers-- stimulus spending financed by running the printing press . The Fed enjoyed some success boosting U.S  growth , but here are five reasons why QE won't work for the ECB . 1 \\. Eurozone Is Not a Country . The European Union does not have a large budget and issues few euro-denominated bonds the ECB could purchase . Instead, the ECB will have to purchase individual country debt -- it is as if the Fed had to purchase a basket of bonds issued by California, Iowa and other states . Markets for European bonds--both sovereign and corporate--and bank lending are highly fragmented along country lines . Consequently ,  it is unlikely that QE will have much effect on banks' willingness to make new business loans in places buffeted by the financial crisis, like Spain and Greece . 2 \\. EU Has No Fannie Mae . QE seems to work best when central banks inject capital directly into specific markets . The Fed purchased mortgage-backed securities that significantly lowered interest rates on mortgages across America . Housing prices recovered much of the value lost during the financial crisis , and new home construction rebounded . The EU has no analog to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and the ECB cannot readily purchase mortgage-backed securities to boost the European housing sector . 3 \\. Fiscal Policy Is Pulling in the Opposite Direction . Europe's largest economy, Germany, recently accomplished a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 , and austerity programs intended to restore solvency have forced massive government spending cuts and tax increases in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean states . Those spending cuts-- though essential to sorely needed structural reforms-- will undercut the effects of any increased bank lending ECB bond purchase may induce . With unemployment hovering at about 25 percent in Spain and Greece, and 13 percent in Italy, banks will remain skeptical that lending to expand businesses will do much to create bigger markets for what they sell . 4 \\. QE Does Little to Fix Euro-Imposed Dysfunctions . Although structural reforms could make Greece, Italy and other high unemployment economies more attractive places to build factories and establish businesses in the long run, governments in Athens, Rome and other capitals face voters who need jobs now . And the cost of labor--though perhaps gradually falling--in these countries will remain too high to attract investment for many years . If Mediterranean countries still had their own currencies , those could let their currencies fall in value relative to those of northern European states . That would re-price labor to attract investment and jobs . But the single currency, the euro, deprives them of that lever . 5 \\. Absence of Pan European Institutions . Though the Europeans have a single currency, they lack common education standards and language that gives the United States a more or less single labor market . In the absence of currency devaluation to re-price Mediterranean labor, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards cannot migrate to Germany where unemployment is only 5 percent, with the same ease that Americans have migrated to South Dakota and Texas to participate in the oil boom . In the end, the EU and ECB lacks what the Fed enjoys--the punch of a national government that ran large deficits to augment its efforts to pull the U.S  economy out of recession and national credit, housing and labor markets that made monetary policies--like QE--reasonably effective .",

            "input": "Five ways Obama could make Castro pay Cuba's $6 billion debt to Americans. In his half century reign of terror, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro committed manifold atrocities . Documented evidence reveals him to be a ruthless tyrant who endlessly abused the most basic of human rights -a man who played a pivotal role in bringing the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation for 13 harrowing days in October of 1962 . Beyond his crimes against humanity and the callous suffering he inflicted on the people of Cuba, he ruined the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Americans . He stole their land, homes, bank accounts, possessions and businesses . He absconded with their property under the guise of \"nationalization.\" But he is, in truth, a thief . Will his victims now be fairly compensated or otherwise see the return of their confiscated property in the wake of America's first steps toward rapprochement with Cuba? The answer is both legal and political . President Obama holds the key . So, don't get your hopes up . The Theft . In the first half of the 20th century, Americans and U.S  businesses dominated Cuba . They accumulated vast holdings of property and operated many of the most lucrative businesses . All of that ended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959 . Castro \"nationalized\" U.S.-owned industries and seized much of the island's private property from Americans . There was no restitution . One legal scholar called it the largest uncompensated expropriation by a foreign government in history . The U.S  retaliated with an embargo, prohibiting all trade . But the Americans who were expelled from Cuba were left holding titles and deeds to homes and businesses to which they had no access . Their property rights were dissolved , and any legal judgments obtained were unenforceable against an isolated nation that refused to recognize any authority other than its own . Thousands pursued legal recourse and sought reparations under indemnification programs established by Congress . Others filed lawsuits and secured judgments . But Castro didn't care . He repudiated the legitimacy of the restitution programs, the valuation of losses and the legal authority of the courts . This , even though Cuba admits their renegade nationalization was, and is, compensable . So what , then ,  does Castro consider fair compensation? Judging from his payouts to other aggrieved nations, it is mere pennies on the dollar . How do you value dirt? In 1961, the U.S  Commerce Department valued American property seized by the Cuban government at roughly $ 1 to 1.8 billion . Nearly 6-thousand claims were legally certified . Other published reports placed the theft as high as $ 9 billion . But the truth is, it's impossible to know -especially inasmuch as the value of everything plummeted the moment Castro took control of the island . What would the same confiscated properties be worth in today's dollars? $50 billion? $100 billion? How about nothing at all? Given how the Castro brothers have driven their economy into the ground, making Cuba one of the poorest nations in the world , valuation could be closer to dirt than dollars . Which invites another question : assuming a monetary value could somehow be devised, how would Cuba pay for it? With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Castros lost their financial benefactor . The island is blighted and broke . Even if it offered government bonds as compensation , are they worth the paper upon which they are written? How could they be secured? Reclaim the property? Theoretically, it is possible for the confiscated property to be reclaimed someday by the original owners . But that would require a dramatic Cuban transformation from socialism to democracy where private property ownership is permitted . In a recent speech, Cuban President Raul Castro insisted Cuba would not renounces its core socialist ideals as part of the deal he negotiated with President Obama to renew diplomatic relations . Even if some semblance of democracy were to be restored to Cuba in the distant future , what remains of the stolen property? No one knows how many of the private residences that were seized have been divided or fallen into decay . Some may no longer exist . And what of the current occupants? Would they allow themselves to be kicked out? The same may be true of the many farms, industries and commercial businesses that were confiscated and have been put to other uses in the last 5 decades . Yes, they have development potential in an open, free market society . But ,  again, the future of Cuba is nebulous . How realistic is the return of these vast holdings under a continuing Castro regime? What Obama should do . As a first condition to normalizing relations, President Obama should demand that all American victims of stolen property be compensated equitably . He is already obligated by law to do this under the Helms-Burton Act . But Obama has a propensity to ignore or overrule with impunity those laws he regards as misguided or inconvenient . This is one law he should follow . A second condition should be the establishment of a commission of judges with legally binding authority to render compensation decisions . Several reparation models can be studied and replicated, notably the tribunal that dispensed claims in post-unification Germany . President Obama has the power and leverage to force the Castro regime to capitulate if Cuba wants to end the sanctions and restore economic relations . But so far, he has uttered not a word about a desire to do so . And when it comes to negotiations with adversaries, Obama tends to give away the store .",

When a US judge struck down California's 2 1/2 year old foie gras ban on Wednesday , a Napa Valley chef said he'd been \"jumping up and down for 90 minutes.\" I'll bet you were, dude . Foie gras hits you in your animal pleasure center with the force of a bullet train and gives you, experientially, a high closer to that of a narcotic than sexual gratification . I was 19 and at le Grand Vefour, the legendary Parisian restaurant, when I first ate foie gras . An unassuming ceramic tub of what looked and smelled a bit like cat food arrived at the table with a glass of Sauternes the color of a hepatitis patient's urine to wash it down . My first, tentative, nibble of foie gras resists any food critic hyperbole for which I could reach to describe how wonderful it was - and has been every time since . You can't argue convincingly with the extraordinarily pleasurable experience of eating foie gras . However ,  you also can't argue convincingly - although many foodies try- that gavage, the force-feeding process which produces the stuff, isn't torture or, at at minimum, animal cruelty of a most hideous type . I am an unapologetic omnivore who worships at the altar of good (and \"bad\") food - so, hardly an animal rights advocate - and I believe that, for the most part, people have the right to to put what they want in their mouths . But the State of California was correct to ban foie gras , and I sincerely hope Attorney General Kamala Harris fights to get the ban reinstated . Contemplate gavage for a moment : for two or three weeks, migratory birds (ducks, geese) are kept in cages . Three times a day they have steel funnels shoved down their throats ; an auger is turned ; and they are force fed . The birds' livers grow enormous - eventually taking up half the space of their lower body . Aquatic birds, like ducks and geese, evolved as creatures who spend most of their time on the water, only occasionally foraging on land . They are social animals who like to hang out in groups, preen and communicate with each other via display and call . Sitting in a cage for a few weeks being force-fed is a horrible fate for any sentient being , but it is particularly nasty for these migratory birds . Some foie gras lovers argue that gavage can be ethical : there are \"good\" poultry farmers who use flexible plastic tubes instead of steel to force feed birds who get to roam around barns . Anthony Bourdain famously commented that \"you see worse [than gavage] in the pay-per-view film on the hotel channel- and that's people, for God's sake\" . (Presumably he was referring to fellatio) . Then there's the \"civilized\" cultures argument: the ancient Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans used gavage to produce foie gras, therefore as a similarly \"civilized\" culture we should be similarly allowed to force feed birds . Possibly the most specious argument against the California ban came from the plaintiffs' lawyer, Michael Tenenbaum , who called the ruling \" a victory for freedom.\" Tenenbaum wasn't ad-libbing : many chefs and foodies have held that banning foie gras is the equivalent to \"cultural imperialism\" and is an abridgment of their basic rights . If Tenenbaum, too, truly believes that , he should be litigating for chefs' rights to make shark fin soup, fry up songbirds, pour boiling oil into live monkeys' brains, and in general cook up anything they damn well please . I get nervous when people - even really smart, talented people - use the word \"freedom\" to mean\"I get to do what I want\" . In the case of foie gras bans, the argument is that, because this food is so delicious, you get to eat it, cook with it, produce it and make money off it - no matter that it's produced as the result of an inhumane practice which has been documented by scientists as causing severe, prolonged suffering to animals . The discontent of civilization, as Freud once pointed out, is that we don't all get to do what we want . The price of getting to live among our fellow humans in a truly civilized society is that we have to repress some of our urges . I love everything about eating foie gras - but I do it rarely , and I look forward to the day when I won't be able to find it on a menu .",

            "input": "Forget the GST on food. Abbott needs to present a new 'grand bargain' to the nation. The problem with not applying the GST to fresh food is that rich people aren't paying GST on fresh food . Taxing the purchase of fresh food is estimated to provide an additional $6bn in government revenue each year . For a federal government with a revenue problem, it must be infuriating to forego billions from people who can fairly easily afford to pay . The problem with applying the GST to fresh food is that poor people would be paying GST on fresh food . Households in the lowest 20% of income earners pay almost two and a half times more GST, as a percentage of income, than households in the highest 20% . For a federal government with a now-cemented reputation for unfairness, it would be foolhardy to make life even more expensive for those who can least afford to pay . Sure, the government could provide GST relief through compensation payments to low-income people , but such payments are inefficient at meeting the actual cost of the tax . They also create another ongoing obligation on the public purse . Some people might consider this a political conundrum, but not some of the fearless members of the Abbott government . Senators Ian Macdonald and Dean Smith, MP Dan Tehan, and trade minister Andrew Robb are rushing forth to call for changes to the rate and base of the GST, including applying the tax to fresh food . The father of Australia's GST, John Howard, has opined in recent years that it was a \"pity\" Labor did not support the GST on fresh food in 1999 . Now others are stepping forward with proposals . Unsurprisingly, business groups want to increase the GST and decrease company tax . The Australia Institute has argued the government could lessen the regressive impact of the GST by expanding the base to include private education and private healthcare- services largely consumed by those on higher incomes  - which it estimates would raise an additional $2.3bn a year . It's an intriguing idea with political appeal , but there are potential budgetary disincentives if the tax pushes people off private services back on to free government services . All this public speculation is leading to the impression that the Abbott government does not have control of the GST agenda . The implications are dreadful for the Coalition . Just ask Campbell Newman and Mike Baird how delighted they are to campaign in a climate of GST hypotheticals . Some conservative commentators have claimed that all the Abbott government needs to do to stem the freefall in the polls is to get its messaging right . Surely in 2015, they say, a better sales pitch - and a fresh-faced young assistant treasurer in Josh Frydenberg - will turn around the public's opinion of the government and its budget . What these folks misunderstand is that good policy makes good politics and no policy makes terrible politics . Right now, the Abbott government has no overarching policy agenda, no coherent narrative, no holistic approach to the nation's current budgetary challenges . Rather ,  it has surprise measures (reintroduction of fuel indexation), broken promises (cuts to the ABC, health, education and the pension), wild new spending commitments (PPL), counter- productive new taxes (GP co-payment), and random thought-bubbles of the kind currently proffered by minister Robb and co . Where to start in solving the problem? First ,  instead of pushing a lot of random levers in its budget and hoping some of them work, the government needs to put forward a \"grand bargain\" to the people of Australia : fixing our budget means we need to fix our complicated, inefficient federation . We need to work out who is going to do what to whom, and who is going to pay for it . It also means fixing our tax system, not just tinkering with high-income levies or raising the GST by a couple of per cent . In short ,  the federation and tax reform white papers should come out as soon as possible . Frankly, these should have come out much, much earlier . What were Coalition members doing as they sat on the Opposition benches waiting to win the \"unloseable election\"? Secondly, as part of this \"grand bargain\", the government needs to get real about ending the age of entitlement . Right now, it is just code for punishing the poor and protecting the rich . The tax system doesn't just have to be fair ; it has to be seen to be fair . Asking the lowest income people to pay GST on fresh food while continuing to give high-income superannuants and investment- property owners massive tax concessions would keep the age of entitlement alive - for those at the top of the income scales .",

            "input": "Free community college isn't a joke for families who spend half their income to send a child. In the United States today, the odds of getting a degree are more tightly linked to family income than ever before, thanks to skyrocketing college costs and insufficient and misallocated federal and state financial aid funds . Although the federal government distributes about $170bn a year in financial aid to many types of students attending many types of schools , many low-income families still have to pay too much . Low-income families often end up paying about 40% of their family income for a member to attend community college - and , for four-year colleges, the bill can add up to a whopping 59% of a family's earnings . Even middle-class families may be asked to spend or borrow a quarter of their annual income to finance one child's attendance at a public university , while the costs of a private one are yet higher . As a result, many families of modest means are unable to afford college . Students from middle- and low-income families have also become more likely to drop out from public colleges and universities, leaving with debts they can't afford to pay back rather than degrees . But these are more than just personal tragedies : they represent a significant loss to America's economy and competitiveness for decades to come . On Friday, President Obama offered a simple, universal solution: free tuition for two years at community colleges for students who maintain a 2.5 grade point average, attend at least half-time and make steady progress towards completing their program . The federal government would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college , and participating states would be expected to pick up the rest . The last time a president did something this bold on higher education was the original Higher Education Act of 1965 . Then, President Lyndon Johnson had a huge Democratic majority in Congress to support his proposal . President Obama, on the other hand, faces a tougher road in a government run by Republicans who are reluctant to support spending more money to help poor and middle class people - yet they should forego partisanship and take this legislation seriously . Instead of being available only to the poorest students(like Pell grants) free community college tuition would be available for all . The most powerful and enduring American social policies - Social Security, infrastructure investments like the highway system and indeed public education itself- have always benefitted everyone . As it stands now , America's outdated student aid policies simply aren't fulfilling their mission and are instead actively failing to make college affordable for all students . And, unlike many other proposals to fix the twin problems of college affordability and student debt focused on four-year programs, free community college has the potential to meet the immediate needs of employers , who often say that they cannot find potential candidates with needed skills . Community college programs in fields like nursing, technology and even management are designed to give students the skills that employers need more quickly than the average bachelor's degree program . Obama's plan is far from perfect . It is not a catch-all solution , and other major problems in American higher education still need to be addressed- including for-profit colleges that consume vast amounts of federal aid dollars but often leave students with little more than terrible debt burdens . The costs of private and public four-year institutions should not be ignored , so that the number of bachelor degree graduates will again rise . And the President's proposal only gives students a discount on tuition , which is just one part (albeit a major one) of the cost of going to school . Yet there is no question that Congress should, if anything, seek to outdo Obama with an even more ambitious proposal, rather than negotiate to reduce his package . They should not let this proposal die upon arrival . Families can't afford to wait through more years of inaction .

            "input": "From Ferguson to immigration: Obama's divide and conquer political strategy has failed our nation. A recent Quinnipiac poll shows support for illegal immigrants at 48 percent, a historic low . This is what the president's cynical manipulation of the Hispanic community has delivered: a hardening of American attitudes . The same distancing will likely occur between blacks and whites as the demonstrations over the grand jury decisions in Ferguson and Staten Island roll on . Whereas only recently a sizable majority of blacks and whites declared themselves comfortable with the state of race relations in the country , pictures of looting and the inflammatory rhetoric of self-interested activists like Al Sharpton will inevitably sharpen racial divides . The insistent proclamations from Attorney General Eric Holder that our justice system is biased, and the president's agreement that the law \"feels like it's being applied in a discriminatory fashion,\" do not help . Today, Obama's well-honed political tactics of dividing and conquering-- so essential to electing a virtual nobody to the Oval Office-- have come asunder . The interest groups wooed by the president have begun to turn against him . Some feel betrayed ; others understand that their demands have isolated them from their fellow countrymen . The only group still giving the president more than a 50 percent approval rating is voters under 3 . For the rest of the poor boobs not caught up in the Obama splinter sweep-- they are eager to elect a successor who might look out for them . Turns out, those forgotten folks are actually in the majority, and just voted in a Republican Senate . According to the Quinnipiac poll, 48 percent of voters think immigrants living in the U.S  illegally should be allowed to stay . That's down from 57 percent last year, and lower than ever . Moreover ,  some 35 percent of the voting public thinks undocumented aliens should be deported -- a record high, and up from 26 percent last year . That's in spite of insistent hectoring from the White House about the moral imperative of providing a legal path for those who are here illegally . Congratulations, Mr  Obama, for ramping up opposition to immigration reform . How to deal with illegal immigrants is not the only issue on which the nation's attitudes are hardening . Last August, after the shooting of Michael Brown (but before the grand jury decision in the case), a New York Times/CBS poll surveyed voters on their attitudes about race . Asked whether race relations had improved or soured during President Obama's time in office, 35 percent of respondents said they had gotten worse , while 52 percent said they had stayed the same . Only 10 percent thought the president had had a positive impact on relations - 8 percent of whites and 17 percent of blacks . That is an impressive underachievement from our first African-American president . Overall ,  78 percent of respondents, when asked about \"race relations in your community,\" said they were \"generally good.\" That included 82 percent of whites and 73 percent of blacks -- a strong vote of confidence, especially from a group that was much less positive about the country as a whole, with only 47 percent saying U.S  race relations were \"generally good.\" This split suggests that people have absorbed the narrative that our country has a race problem not from their personal experience in their own communities, but from the media or our political leaders . The most compelling aspect of that story line entails racial bias in law enforcement . Many initiatives, from decriminalizing marijuana possession to de-emphasizing tactics like \"stop and frisk,\" have been promulgated based on the fact that more blacks than whites end up on the wrong side of the law . Holder has even dumbed down school discipline measures, arguing they constitute an example of racial bias . The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga sheds some welcome light on this issue . According to surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics over the past 20 years, the number of confrontations between Americans and the police has declined, as has the use of force by law enforcement officials . Most important, perhaps, is that the declines were recorded not just for whites, but for all races . In 2002, 173,000 African-Americans reported a \"use of force\"; in 2011, that was down to 130,000 . Nearly 83 percent of blacks who were involved in traffic stops(the most numerous encounters) agreed with the statement,\"When I was stopped by the police, the officers acted properly.\" That figure was up from 78 percent in 2002 . As for so-called \"street stops,\" the Bureau reports,\"In 2011, less than 1% of the 241.4 million U.S  residents age 16 or older were involved in a street stop\" ; further ,  \"no differences were observed in the percentage of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic populations age 16 or older involved in a street stop.\" So much for unfair profiling . Under 3 percent of police encounters involve \"street stops\" of an involuntary nature ; of those stopped (likely not a happy crew), two-thirds said the cops behaved \"properly and respectfully.\" This review does not suggest a law enforcement community reviled by the African-American community, or the country . President Obama has tried to curry favor with blacks, Hispanics, women, the young and the poor by convincing them that they suffer from injustices, that they are victimized by the one percent, by law enforcement, by corporations or insurers -- or by Republicans . Americans aren't buying it . Increasingly, they see a country victimized by an incompetent president .",

            "input": "From Guantanamo to Montevideo and on to Havana. The news of the Guantanamo detainees' arrival to Uruguay received impressive coverage in international media . Uruguay is the second Latin American country to accept Guantanamo detainees ; the first one was El Salvador, which welcomed two Chinese nationals in 2012 . The fact that there have been only two countries in Latin America accepting Guantanamo inmates is already particularly extraordinary, given US historical ascendancy on the region . Even US' main allies in the region, Chile and Colombia, rejected US proposals to accept prisoners from Guantanamo, considering the move highly unpopular . Perhaps the spotlight fell on Uruguay as a Guantanamo detainee host because of Mujica's own media popularity over his unusually humble way of life as a world leader, and his progressive public speeches and political agenda . He also managed to get a lot of media attention over the arrival of around forty Syrian refugees in October , although they were few in number compared to the thousands of refugees that neighbouring countries such as Brazil and Argentina have been accepting . The day the detainees landed in Montevideo, Mujica sent an open letter to Uruguayans and Barack Obama . The first sentence reads,\"Solidarity is the tenderness of the people\", a quote from Pablo Neruda referring to the 1939 exodus of Spanish Republicans escaping fascism to South America . Neruda's words well reflect the main humanitarian goal of the operation , which aims to to reinforce the image of Uruguay as a peacemaker and international reference for humanitarian issues . \"Pepe\" has the aspiration, before ceding power to Tabare Vazquez at the beginning of 2015, to spread his humanitarian legacy and reinforce his world reputation . Through the well-publicised gesture, Mujica aims to give hope to all those disenchanted people who still think that idealism and ethics in politics are still possible . From a political perspective, Mujica's usual anti-imperialist stance left many in Uruguay astonished that he was willing to do a \"favour\" to Obama and accept the Guantanamo detainees . It is only in the second part of his open letter that his political goals become apparent . Mujica asks, as a gesture of reconciliation for all the American people, for the release of a 70 years-old Puerto Rican independence fighter, along with three Cuban detainees who are part of the group known as the Cuban Five , and whose controversial detention in the late 1990s led to a worldwide campaign for their release . He also asks for the lifting of the \"unjust embargo\" imposed on \"our sister\" Cuba . Mujica's plea is reflective of an emerging regional bloc different than the usual \"left-leaning\" one . It is instead a heterogeneous regional political bloc able to come to terms with ideological differences and to find common ground for regional coexistence in the name of progress . Best example of this is the ongoing peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government in Cuba, with the participation of Chile and Venezuela . Mujica's move, therefore, is not unprecedented . Back in 2009 the late Hugo Chavez hinted at the possibility of accepting Guantanamo detainees in Venezuela and at raising the issue of Cuba's isoluation . Cuba's reintegration into regional life, after decades of US ostracism, represents the main political goal of the bloc and of Mujica humanitarian operation . Therefore ,  it is not surprise that Jose Miguel Insulza, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) publicly lauded Mujica's move . Although leftist American governments have been particularly at odds with the Washington-based regional organisation, as consequence of the informal exclusion of Cuba under US pressure , Insulza has been working hard to reverse it . Just recently, he said that he hoped both Cuba and the US would attend the next OAS summit planned for April in Panama City . The US is unlikely to release the Cuban political prisoners , but Cuba's unilateral release of Alan Gross after 5 years could be part of a larger swap following Mujica's move . The six Guantanamo detainees will probably be the last ones to be resettled in the region . But their landing in Montevideo made it clear that Latin America is not, and will not be again the US backyard .",

Twenty five years ago on December 20, 1989, El Chorrillo, an Afro-Panamanian neighbourhood in the centre of Panama city was the scene of a criminal assault by the military forces of the United States government . A vigorous assault from the most powerful military body on the planet was unleashed by President George H W Bush to execute an arrest warrant issued by a US court on General Manuel Antonio Noriega, the de facto head of the sovereign state of Panama, and up until that time an obedient servant of US interests in the region . Significant elements of the outgunned Panamanian defence forces had barracks in the El Chorrillo community and as a consequence it was turned into a free fire zone by the invading forces, despite the fact that the invaders knew that thousands of civilians also lived in the densely populated community . As Marta Sanchez and others who experienced the assault remembered, the people of El Chorrillo, whose descendants came from the Caribbean to Panama as cheap labour to build the canal, never knew what hit them when they awoke to the sounds of machine gun fire from the 82nd Airborne division . When the firing stopped and the smoke from the fires finally subsided, thousands were dead and the neighbourhood largely destroyed . \"Black Lives Matter\" is a refrain whose importance is reflective of the value that black people place on our lives , yet we must disabuse ourselves of the illusion that black lives or any other lives matter when they stand in the way of the political and capital interests of US elites and that it is not limited to black communities in the US . As human rights strategist Ajamu Baraka points out:\"The black lives taken by the murderous assault on Panama 25 years ago should be a sober reminder that US state violence is not confined to ghettoes and barrios of the US but is a central component of the racist, colonial, capitalist project that is the US. We cannot pretend that police brutality in the US and the devaluation of black life that it represents is restricted just to the black experience in the heart of the US empire.\" The attack on Panama and the massive loss of life and destruction was a harbinger of the lawlessness and aggression that would characterise US policies in the unipolar world of the late 20th and early 21st century . When President Noriega failed to support US efforts to destabilise Nicaragua and had the audacity to publicly defy the US state with his defiant rhetoric, Bush had a perfect opportunity to establish the terms for what he referred to as a new world order of unchecked US power . Panama became a demonstration project to communicate to the nations of the global south that resistance to US hegemony would be met with ferocious violence . The fact that scores of black lives would be lost as part of the demonstration was of no consequence to the policymakers of hegemony . The structures and relations of repression are linked from the centre of the empire to its periphery states . US police forces train police departments throughout the world through programmes such as the International Taskforce Agent Training, (conducted by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations) including police officers that work in communities like El Chorrillo . The US police forces bring with them their military, interrogation, intimidation and racially biased tactics which involve use of excessive force on civilians . It is also internationally known that police are quicker to use force, shoot and kill black people, the same way that the US is quick to invade smaller countries with less power , because in the scope of the political reality, they matter less . Violence is integral to the project of western colonial capitalist domination from Palestine to Ferguson . \"On this 25th anniversary of the US invasion of Panama, we need to remember that the struggle for black liberation is ongoing. US authorities must be made to understand that the value of black life is not determined by the borders that those black bodies find themselves. The destruction in Panama is a reminder to my generation that our demand is not new,\" says Alicia Garza, National Domestic Workers Special Projects director and cofounder of #BlackLivesMatter . While we remember the victims of the US invasion of Panama, the families of the thousands of victims of US criminality in Panama are still demanding justice and accountability 25 years later . Like the families of Eric Garner and Mike Brown and the victims of police violence in the US, they are part of the long line of victims of US criminality globally . These crimes will continue until the people - black people in particular - are able to build the power necessary to ensure that black lives really matter in the US and across the globe .",

            "input": "The generational change in US-Cuba relations. The announcement of a new era of relations between the United States and Cuba came as a surprise to many who follow and study the relationship between the two rivals . The old guard of Cuban exiles, led by Senator Marco Rubio, predictably reacted with their usual anger . By contrast, many second generation Cuban Americans and advocates reacted differently - with optimism and hope for change . It is important to understand those reactions to the recent announcement as part of a broader evolution towards new relations between the US and Cuba over 20 years in the making, following fundamental security, economic, and political changes . The end of the Cold War in 1989 spelled change for Latin America, just as it did for the world . For Cuba, it meant the loss of its biggest sponsor , which plunged the island into a five-year economic tailspin, contracted its GDP by 30 to 45 percent, and precipitated a number of changes to Cuban policy and law . Those reforms have accelerated throughout the last decade, including an ongoing plan to unify the island's dual currency . Cuba has had no choice but to liberalise portions of its economy and European countries have been able to take advantage of those opportunities . In the last two decades, a Cuban economy starved for growth has looked overseas and seen the island more willing to come to agreement regarding foreign presence . The implications of the fall of the Soviet Union were not only economic in nature, but also resulted in a shift in US policy towards Latin America more broadly . In the 20-plus years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the US has tolerated, or even openly collaborated with, leftist regimes in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Honduras that in another era would have been deliberately undermined, or perhaps overthrown, as in the cases of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua . The strategic and military calculus of our relationship with Cuba has fundamentally changed . Presidents and Congress no longer have the blanket justification of Cuba as a military threat as they did during the Cold War . For Cuban exiles, 1989 was not so much a watershed moment as an opportunity to continue applying pressure to a failing regime . The Cuban-American lobby continued to promote isolationism , believing that this post-Soviet moment was finally the chance to see a democratic counterrevolution on the island . This belief that isolation would force the collapse of Castro regime restricted policy responses available to the US government and presidential administrations . Changes in the global economic and political relationship with Cuba did not affect US policy and Cuba, for the most part, was excluded from the more moderate and tolerant US foreign policy towards Latin America . Republican presidents and legislators proved to be more punitive towards the island - particularly given their reliance on the Cuban-American lobby for monetary and electoral support in south Florida . Despite a cooling in relations during the late 1990s, due to the shooting down of the two US planes flown by \"Brothers to the Rescue\", President Bill Clinton eased restrictions on humanitarian aid, broadened the ability to send remittances, increased allowable person-to-person interactions, and resumed direct flights between the countries . President Clinton's actions were part of a broader government strategy of \"constructive engagement\" , in which the US would actively engage with the Cuban people, but maintain pressure on the government . The new millennium did not bring significant changes in relations as, true to Republican form, President George W Bush maintained the status quo of \"constructive engagement\" . If anything , his administration took a harder line, at times including Cuba in the same paragraph as the \"Axis of Evil\" . However , even as President Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and conservative Cuban- American legislators continued to push a hard line on Cuba , the profile of the average Cuban American changed . The stereotypical conservative Cuban - still upset, and rightfully so, over the nationalisation of private property and human rights abuses during the revolution - still attempts to dominate political discourse . But a new face of the Cuban American has emerged - young, second-generation children have come of age with the desire to see for themselves the homeland that they have only heard about in stories ; and new, post-1989 migrants, who are economic rather than political refugees, have closer personal ties to the island . The election of President Obama and the nomination of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State signalled a new era with a renewed focus on diplomacy . Four months after taking office, the administration quietly continued to liberalise relations between the US and Cuba . However ,  Alan Gross' imprisonment in 2009 gave opportunity for the age-old arguments against Cuba to resurface , with the old guard claiming that nothing had changed and seeing it as the latest example of the long history of Cuban aggression . I do not dispute the fact that the Castro brothers have been harsh dictators and that their system of government has deeply damaged multiple generations of Cubans, nor do I dispute that regime change should still be a goal of US policy . However as my analysis has shown, the rest of the story has changed . Cuba's economy continues to search for growth , and the government is actively looking outside the country for investment . Long gone are the existential security threats that came from the island during the Cold War . Moreover ,  this reflects the changing opinions of Cuban Americans . The new modes of engagement announced by Obama on December 17 were not an acknowledgement of defeat, but an effort for a new way forward that reflects those changes .

            "input": "A Greek euro exit would hurt Europe - but not as much as it would hurt Greece. When the people of Greece go to the polls on 25 January, they will face some fairly fundamental choices . Contrary to what many politicians and commentators would have you believe, this election is not about whether Greeks want to stay in the euro - a majority clearly wants to . The real question is whether this latest turn in the drama will finally force Greek politicians to act in their country's long-term interest . Opinion polls suggest that Greek voters oscillate between anger and fear: anger about the enormous costs they have had to bear in the course of the adjustment programme; and fear of what would happen if Alexis Tsipras, head of the hard-left Syriza movement that still leads in the polls, tries to force through another cut in Greece's international debt . In the last debt restructuring in 2012, the creditors already promised to help Greece reduce its debt to more sustainable levels by 2020 - provided Athens continues to improve its budget . The Greeks have a democratic right to elect a leader who wants to tear up this agreement ; just as Germans, Dutch, Finns and others have a right to elect governments that insist on such deals being adhered to . Although Tsipras says he does not want to leave the euro , the resulting showdown could force Greece out of the single currency . Today, the spectre of \"Grexit\" is more threatening to the Greeks than to the rest of Europe . Reforms in Spain, Portugal and Ireland have made these countries more resilient . International rescue funds and the European Central Bank stand ready to help in case panic should nevertheless spread . Five out of Germany's eight leading economic research institutes think the eurozone could now cope with a Greek exit . This does not mean, however, that Germany or the other eurozone countries want Greece to leave . Even if contagion was limited, another worsening of the eurozone crisis would undermine confidence, stunt the region's fragile recovery and make Europe's leaders - many of whom have declared the crisis over- look inept . The political and economic consequences for other European countries would be severe . Therefore , even if the rest of Europe does not want to be blackmailed , it will likely be ready to talk . The new Greek government, whether it is led by the incumbent premier Antonis Samaras, Tsipras, or a new coalition, could reasonably demand a new grand bargain under which the ECB-IMF-EC troika of lenders agrees to revisit the debt issue while the Greek government promises to make the economy fit for the future . Economic reform, however, is hardly what Greek politicians are talking about in this election campaign . Greek voters face the unenviable choice between re- electing the mainstream politicians who landed Greece in its current mess in the first place, or voting for Tsipras or other populists who make unrealistic promises of higher wages and more security . The trouble is not that Tsipras is radical ; it is that he is not radical enough . By promising state handouts to voters and protection for vested interests, he is perpetuating the dysfunctional system that plunged Greece into crisis . Over the past few years, the ruling coalition between the two established parties has tried a tricky balancing act of preserving the system of bureaucratic cronyism that since the 1970s they have helped to build, and modernising Greece's state and economy , as promised to international lenders . The result was an often agonisingly slow process of to and fro, with troika officials regularly departing in frustration about Greek foot-dragging . It is not only the troika's emphasis on austerity that has caused the Greek people so much pain . As important was that huge adjustments were foisted upon an extraordinarily rigid economy . Despite much effort to open up mollycoddled sectors since 2010, Greece is still one of Europe's most overregulated economies . Sluggish bureaucracies and exaggerated form-filling are the main reason Greece's exports have not rebounded like those of Spain, Portugal and Ireland . The absence of a reliable land registry is holding back investment . An unreformed social security system still benefits better-off households more than the destitute . While the tax burden on ordinary people has risen , wealthy individuals and companies can still often evade their dues . And wages in the public sector have fallen - but nowhere near as fast as those in the private sector, despite starting from a much higher level . Greek politicians must get serious about removing the shackles from the economy . Economists think the benefits of structural reforms could materialise quickly in Greece's inefficient economy, and would be substantial . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that Greek businesses could save hundreds of millions of euros a year if the government scrapped burdensome regulations . The Greek thinktank IOBE calculates that improvements to the business and investment environment could lift GDP by more than 2% in just two years , while steps to increase competition in industries and services would have an even bigger impact . Greece has started building a sounder economy on the wreckage of a public sector bubble and a strangulated private sector . The costs have been exorbitant . It would be a real Greek tragedy if the country's next government squandered the potential gains and reversed the process .",

            "input": "The Guardian view on counter-terror cooperation: walking the line. Ten days after the Paris attacks, the security repercussions continue . Yesterday Sir John Sawers, recently retired as head of MI6, called for renewed cooperation between intelligence agencies and internet companies . Meanwhile, European foreign ministers met to strengthen anti-terrorism coordination within the EU, and called for a stronger alliance with Arab states in combating jihadi networks . The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said:\"The threat is not only the one we faced in Paris, but it is spreading in other parts of the world, starting from Muslim countries.\" Better coordination is undoubtedly needed to foil further attacks in Europe , where Islamist terrorists have struck in three capitals - Madrid, London and now Paris . Anti-terrorism raids in France and Belgium confirm that the threat continues . The Paris killers had links with networks across the Middle East, including in Yemen . So the need to share intelligence to counter groups that themselves operate and communicate easily across borders cannot be disputed . A further illustration of this came when an Algerian national appeared before a Greek prosecutor on Monday over a possible link to a foiled Islamist plot to attack police in Belgium . It is logical for Europe to reach out to Arab countries . The first victims of violent jihadism are, after all, to be found in the Arab world . In the Middle East and north Africa, terrorists have targeted Muslims first and foremost . It came as little surprise that the Arab League secretary general, Nabil el-Araby - who has recently met Ms Mogherini- immediately declared his organisation's readiness to help European partners in dealing with a danger that spans many regions . It is, nevertheless, vital that such cooperation avoids the mistakes of the past . This is not a war of civilisations . It is a fight against a violent sectarian ideology that finds breeding grounds in Europe's disenfranchised communities and in the killing fields of the Middle East . Ms Mogherini is correct to state that this is \"not an issue between Europe or the west and Islam\" . But this effort must give proper priority to precautions and standards that have, in the past, been all too often trampled upon . The global war on terror proclaimed in the aftermath of 9/11 involved measures that violated fundamental rights and international law . Western cooperation with repressive Arab states involved rendition flights and the outsourcing of torture . Many regimes used repressive methods and emergency legislation to crush dissent as much as to track terrorists . Last month this system of abuses was detailed in the damning US Senate report on the secret CIA programme that ran detention sites and organised the transfer of detainees with the cooperation of partner countries , some of which were in the Arab and Muslim world . Calling for an alliance between Europe and Arab countries in a renewed fight against terrorism is important . But it should not permit any amnesia about where this has led in the past decade . In the Middle East and north Africa, many regimes continue to show complete disregard for basic human rights and legal procedures - as the recent flogging of a Saudi blogger has illustrated . Only one country, Tunisia, can claim to have reached some form of stable democracy in the wake of the Arab spring . Others are run by despots or by military juntas, as in Egypt, or have been caught in a spiral of anarchy, as in Libya . Human rights activists and civil society struggle to do their work under immense pressure . There are few checks and balances . Nor is there sufficient oversight of security forces conducting anti-terrorism efforts . So , as Europeans reach out to these regimes , they must beware of the pitfalls . An alliance with authoritarian powers, made blindly or naively, can too easily involve the abandonment of values, a dangerous sense of impunity and even indifference towards the worst abuses . It can also backfire , because repression in some Arab states has provoked fresh discontent and radicalisation . All these things have happened in recent years . This time, therefore, Europe must rigorously uphold its standards as it embarks on this new era of cooperation . This time, the price of mutual assistance must not be a blind eye or a guilty silence about unacceptable abuses .",

            "input": "The Guardian view on talks between Angela Merkel and David Cameron. If politics were like boxing , meetings between national leaders would be arranged according to weight . In the asymmetrical world of international relations, however, disparity is the norm rather than the exception . So it is with Angela Merkel and David Cameron , who confer together in London on Wednesday . The chancellor is the heavyweight contender , while the prime minister would rate as middleweight at most . The difference, unfortunately, is not just a reflection of the strength and size of the two countries concerned . It is also a measure of the stature of these two politicians . Mrs Merkel's characteristics - her steadiness, her careful thinking through of problems, her solid control of her party, her reluctance to move until she is sure of the right course, her refusal to play to the gallery - enhance Germany's influence in Europe and the world . With Mr Cameron, the reverse is true . He has charm and a certain decency , but he is too easily blown off course by adverse winds arising within his own party and outside it . This has led him to take positions on Europe and immigration that could have been expressly designed to reduce our influence on our neighbours, ones that could lead to Britain departing the European Union . That would leave the United Kingdom in an isolation which it can be guessed Mr Cameron does not want but which he could nevertheless end up having brought about . So it is that , as our former Berlin correspondent argues, he looks to Germany for rescue, hoping that Mrs Merkel's government will help craft changes in European regulations that Mr Cameron will then be able to present to his own party and to voters attracted by Ukip's nostrums as helping Britain control the flow of immigrants . Whether such changes actually would have that effect in any longer term is another matter . Mr Cameron may not care too much about that, wanting only the appearance of concessions to help him out of the political corner into which he has painted himself . Contrast Mrs Merkel's forthright remarks on the anti-Islamic demonstrations with which Germany is currently coping, with Mr Cameron's skirting of the moral aspects of the immigration debate to see the difference . Mrs Merkel has to manage a crammed portfolio of European problems . Britain's difficulties are not at the top of the heap . The most important general issue she faces is whether to stick with an unalloyed austerity programme that is becoming more and more politically explosive in southern Europe . The most immediate specific question is how to cope with a possible change of government in Greece . A more fundamental problem, in terms of the dynamics of the union, is how to prop up the old partnership with France . And the most obvious external problem is how to manage Ukraine and Russia . Here, at least, Britain and Germany seem to be on the same page . Mrs Merkel is the strongest and most important leader in Europe . She is hardly beyond reproach . The contradiction in her position is that at home she essentially governs as a social democrat, yet she operates as a neoliberal hawk abroad . Her austerity drive can be said, at the very least, to be causing as many problems as it solves . Her insistence on reform in Greece is vague when it should be detailed, leading to the suspicion that the problem is that, in German eyes, Greece can do nothing right . Domestically, she often manages to \"solve\" political problems by simply sitting them out , while her parliamentarians squabble and everyone gets bored of the subject and moves on . That is how she dealt with the scandal of the NSA monitoring her mobile phone : she largely kept quiet when many were hoping that she would raise her voice more loudly . But in broader foreign policy matters, that is not a working strategy in the long run . Her dealings with Russia's President Vladimir Putin over the past year show signs of a learning curve : she has been not just quiet but quietly firm . The world is still waiting for her to show similar leadership in the eurozone crisis . But at least she is in a position to do so . Mr Cameron, however, has all but written himself out of the European script . He is not a problem-solver, as Mrs Merkel is or could be, but a problem in himself for Europe, and yet another cross for the chancellor to bear .",

            "input": "The hapless, harmless Palestinian leader? January 15 marks a decade since Mahmoud Abbas became the Palestinian president , during which time the goals he claims to espouse not only remain unrealised, but are more remote than ever . He is still in office despite his term ending six years ago; the democratic process that brought him to power no longer in existence . He speaks of his people's human rights while his Palestinian Authority actively curtails them . He claims to champion their national rights while collaborating unconditionally with the country that denies them . Abbas' image as a hapless, harmless figure deflects from the cunning and ruthlessness of someone whose primary concern, like the Middle East's other autocrats, seems to be his longevity . The fact that he plays ball with the West and Israel somehow makes this okay . Where other Arab strongmen nurture an image of power to maintain it , he relies on being seen as an underdog . But this illusion, which has traditionally served Abbas well, no longer extends to his people . Many think he and the PA serve their own interests and those of Israel, rather than those of the Palestinians . According to a poll last month, 55 percent believe that the PA has become \"a burden on the Palestinian people\" . Regarding the presidency, Abbas has consistently lagged in opinion polls behind his Fatah colleague, Marwan Barghouti . Since Israel's last Gaza invasion, he also runs behind Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh . Is it mere coincidence, then, that Abbas has been lacklustre in campaigning for Barghouti's release from Israeli jail; or in pursuing and implementing national unity deals with Hamas that call for elections? Since the signing of the latest reconciliation agreement in April, Abbas has at various times threatened to end it, and has been openly adversarial towards Hamas . Elections that were due within six months never happened , so he remains unchallenged - this has gone largely unnoticed . The PA - which is meant to safeguard Palestinian rights- serially abuses them . Human Rights Watch has documented \"police beatings and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators\", \"excessive force\", \"repressing critical news reporting and demonstrations\", \"suppressing dissenting views\", and \"serious rights abuses, including credible allegations of torture\" , for which \"no security officials were convicted\" . As such, the PA is not only failing to curb Israeli abuses, but is busy perpetrating its own, all under Abbas' watch . The PA has garnered a reputation among Palestinians for managing the occupation rather than striving to end it . One way it does this is \"security coordination\" with Israel , which Abbas described last year as \"sacred\" despite the vast majority of Palestinians opposing it . Such coordination serves Israel by enabling it to subcontract its occupation, and serves the PA by helping it suppress internal dissent . It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people . Abbas and his foreign minister have made grotesque assurances that as long as he is president, he will not allow an uprising against Israel . So the PA, which is supposed to be part of a national liberation struggle, is willing to put down an uprising by its own people against their subjugation . This is nothing short of betrayal . For more than 20 years, the PA has participated in a \"peace process\" that has greatly entrenched Israeli control . Abbas himself was an architect of the disastrous Oslo Accords . The occupied territories are now so colonised and fragmented that a viable Palestinian state is widely considered impossible . Yet ,  Abbas still wants to negotiate, despite Israel being clearly opposed to Palestinian self-determination . What, then, is the point of negotiating? Perhaps to preserve the privileged elites to which the PA and the \"peace process\" gave birth . After all ,  allegations of corruption and nepotism, including Abbas and his family, are nothing new . With the help of international aid, the PA is the largest employer of Palestinians, much like other autocracies that encourage public dependence on the state to avoid mass unrest . A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel . He opposes armed resistance, and has gone to great lengths to disarm militants in the West Bank . However ,  he also opposes peaceful forms of resistance, including the increasingly effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement . Furthermore ,  it took the PA more than two years since Palestine's upgraded UN status to apply to join the International Criminal Court, despite repeated threats to do so amid constant Israeli provocations . That Abbas finally relented may not only, or necessarily, be about losing patience with Israel, but about assuaging mounting Palestinian anger at his procrastination in applying to the ICC . Meanwhile, he says he will keep pushing for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a deadline to end Israel's occupation , despite the certainty of repeated failure by US veto . Abbas seems to be attempting a balancing act . He wants to prove to Israel, and his western and Arab backers, that he is their best Palestinian partner, safe in the knowledge that they will not accept Hamas rule, but mindful not to suffer the same fate as Yasser Arafat once he was no longer deemed useful or reliable . However ,  his recent, uncharacteristic defiance against Israel reflects a need to stop his flagging domestic popularity turning into an uprising against him and the PA . Abbas has nothing to show his people after 10 years as president, and at least another decade as part of the \"peace process\" . He remains in office because of, not despite, Israel's occupation and Palestinian disunity .",

A Massachusetts school that advertises itself as an \"inclusive community\" banned Santa Claus from its annual Christmas concert in the hometown of Harvard University after someone complained . \"I am writing to you today to inform you of a change in our concert series this winter,\" wrote Principal Jennifer Ford in a letter to parents of the Peabody School in Cambridge . \"Our first through fourth grade concert as well as our kindergarten concert will not include a visit from Santa Claus this year.\" The principal did not explain why Santa was banned from the December 12 concert . Could local environmentalists have taken issue with his carbon footprint? Did animal rights activists complain about the welfare of Prancer and Vixen? Did the milk and cookies violate the school's \"Let's Move\" food rules? It's hard to know for sure -- but I'm going to take a wild guess and say they probably thought Santa was the \"Reason for the Season.\" CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION . Moms and dads around Cambridge, Mass  say the principal's ban is naughty, not nice and some are ready to jingle somebody's bells . \"I come from a city that celebrates diversity and tolerance,\" parent Robert Thompson told Fox & Friends . \"At its base this decision reeks of intolerance.\" Instead ,  Jolly Old Saint Nick has been relegated to a family sing-along on the day before Christmas Eve . Thompson said as if they are saying Santa is not \"good enough for the main show.\" The school was afraid even that even the presence of Old St  Nick overly sensitive residents . \"I am sensitive to the fact that you may not want your child involved in this event,\" Ford wrote in a letter obtained by the Boston Globe . \"If you prefer that your child spend time with me that afternoon , please let me know . I will be in the library, playing games and reading books with the children.\" How's that for an unadulterated does of liberal lunacy? It's enough to curdle your egg nog . Jeffrey Young is the superintendent of this calamitous mess of public education . He told the Globe he doesn't understand why Santa needs to visit the Peabody School . \"There's no anti-Santa sentiment,\" he told the newspaper . \"It's just that there's no pro-Santa sentiment either... Santa's not on the top of my list\" . I'd be willing to bet a pound of fruitcake the superintendent is at the top of Santa's list . Mr  Thompson said the school celebrates all sorts of cultures - so why not his? \"They are telling me mine is not acceptable,\" he said . Of course ,  this is the hometown of Harvard University - so it's fair to say they have a disproportionate number of certifiable citizens . This is the same town that in 2007 stopped a Boy Scout troop from collecting care packages for American soldiers . They scouts were accused of making a political statement . And how can we forget about the city's war on carbonation? The mayor wanted to ban any bottled soft drinks larger than 16 ounces . They also wanted to decide how much popcorn citizens could pop and how many milkshakes citizens could slurp . And if you need further proof that Cambridge is to the left of Vladimir Putin , consider this item from the 2006 edition of The Harvard Crimson . A member of the Cambridge Public Schools Committee compared a law mandating the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to a \"post 9/11 ultra-patriotism push.\" School committee member Luc Schuster told the newspaper that \"pledging blind allegiance\" to the United States stifles the intellectual capacity of children.\" You just can't argue with that kind of ignorance, folks . Sounds to me like they've been smoking too much mistletoe . As they say back home in Tennessee- the cheese has done slid off the cracker . Ho, ho, ho, America!",

Hollywood loves Barack Obama and it has expressed this in every way it knows how, from celebrity endorsements and campaign appearances to huge donations . In the 2012 presidential race, show biz folks gave Obama more than six million dollars, five times as much as Romney got . It has even been announced that a biopic of Obama's first date with Michelle--dinner and a Spike Lee movie--is on the way . Without spoiling the plot I can reveal that it has a happy ending . So Hollywood loves Obama and , not surprisingly, Obama loves it right back . In fact ,  he is an admirer of its role in the world . \"Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy,\" Obama told an A-list gathering of movie stars and film executives at DreamWorks, in November 2013 . \"It is part of what makes us exceptional, part of what makes us such a world power . Hundreds of millions of people may never set foot in the United States, but thanks to you, they've experienced a small part of what makes our country special . They've learned something about our values . We have shaped a world culture through you...in a way that has made the world better.\" This is what is known as a matter of opinion . A dissenting view is held by hundreds of millions of Muslims who consider the incursions of the American cinema to be a dangerous and despicable form of Zionist-Crusader cultural imperialism . Obama's speech to Hollywood will not disabuse them of this belief . \".[Foreigners] might not know the Gettysburg Address,\" Obama said , \"but if they're watching some old movie, maybe \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" or \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" or \"Will and Grace\" and \"Modern Family,\" they've had a front-row seat to our march towards progress, even if their own nations haven't made that progress yet . And young people in countries all around the world suddenly make a connection and have an affinity to people who look don't like them and maybe originally they might have been fearful of, and now suddenly they say, oh, this person is like me -- which is one of the powers of art , but that's what you transmit.\" It would be comforting to think that the president was simply flattering his audience . If he actually believes this , his lack of sophistication about the Middle East makes George W  Bush look like Lawrence of Arabia . \"Mary Tyler Moore\"? Women aren't even allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia . They are forced to wear \"modest\" clothing down to their ankles in Iran . In most of the region, a woman who disobeys her husband or talks back to him faces a beating at best, usually with the hearty approval of the wife's family father and brothers . \"Will and Grace\"? Homosexuality is a capital crime throughout most of the Arab world because it is seen as an offense against Allah and the family . The only gay bars in the Arab world and Iran are on the windows of prison cells . \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\"? A Muslim girl crazy enough to bring home an infidel fiance is inviting a sequel: \"Guess Who's Having a Funeral\"? Parents, clergy and community elders in the Middle East are not entertained, let alone edified, by Hollywood values . They are horrified by what they see as a godless foreign assault on their children, their religion and their way of life . In most places even G-rated films are considered transgressive . They can be found mostly via under-the-counter bootleggers or downloaded in secret . And they are . Their impact on young people is not the liberation Obama imagines , however . Unmarried men do not have unfettered access to members of the opposite sex and many find explicit depictions to be frustrating and humiliating . In some, they even inspire a militant puritanical Islam that makes posthumous sex the ultimate reward for killing infidels . Unmarried young women, lacking even that outlet, need to be careful and obedient to the code of conduct . A girl caught trying to emulate the tamest teenage movie role model puts her life in danger . My point is not that Hollywood is wrong to make movies and television shows that reflect American social values and suit the American audience . And I certainly don't expect the president to inform his biggest boosters that their creations ignite resentment, hostility and holy war . I do hope, though, that the president and his advisers understand this:\"Will and Grace,\" \"Mary Tyler Moore\" and even the new Obama biopic may win Oscars and Emmys, but in a struggle for hearts and minds in a region where cutting- edge refers to swords, not cinema, Hollywood is not a strategic American asset .",

            "input": "The hostage rescue dilemma. Saturday's failed hostage rescue mission in Yemen was indeed tragic . While the official details as to exactly what happened have not yet been released , it appears Luke Somers, an American journalist, and Pierre Korkie, a South African teacher, were killed by their captors during a night-time rescue attempt carried out by US Navy SEALs . Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had been holding Somers and Korkie captive for over a year . It was the second such attempt to rescue Somers in two weeks . On November 25, a SEALs team hit what they thought was the compound holding Somers , who, as it turns out, had been moved from there just hours before . In Saturday's operation, the SEALs knew Somers' exact location . To maintain stealth, they landed by V-22 Osprey several kilometres away, and then made the trek overland to the compound where Somers and Korkie were being held captive . But something went terribly wrong in the final approach . Perhaps it was a barking dog or some other noise , but the SEALs came under fire as they approached the compound's main entrance . The element of surprise, which is so critical to rescue operations, was lost , and a fierce firefight ensued . Within 30 minutes, the SEALs had secured the compound and put Somers and Korkie, who were both still alive on a V-22 that had a surgical team standing by . Unfortunately, medics were unable to save them . Plainly necessary . For Somers, Saturday's rescue mission was as urgent as it was plainly necessary . Late last week AQAP released a video stating he would be killed in 72 hours unless unspecified demands were met . Those demands have not been made public, but likely involved payment of a ransom or release of AQAP captives, something the US is prohibited by law from doing . For Korkie, the sense of urgency in attempting the rescue operation is more controversial . According to the South African charity Gift of the Giving, a deal had been made with AQAP to release Korkie in just a matter of days, suggesting to many that it would have been better to wait . Maybe there was a deal that would have gone through in the end . Maybe there wasn't . But in rescue operations, hope is not figured into the equation , where planners and decision makers have to weigh the risks of action against the consequences of inaction . By their very nature, hostage rescue operations are among the most difficult and risky military missions to carry out . With little margin for error, either in intelligence or the operation itself, they demand highly trained and equipped special operations units that only a handful of countries have . Are they dangerous and uncertain? Absolutely . Are they impossible? No . In 2012, US Navy SEALs rescued Jessica Buchanan, an American aid worker, and Poul Hagen Thisted, a Danish aid worker , who had been held hostage by Somali pirates for 93 days . The pirates were demanding a $45m ransom for their release . In this particular case, precise intelligence as to their exact location, along with concerns about Buchanan's rapidly declining health, were major factors in moving forward with the rescue mission . Under the cover of darkness, the SEAL Team parachuted 19km from where they were being held, and then moved cross-country to conduct the rescue . Nine pirates were killed during the operation , and Buchanan and Thisted were unharmed . In 2009, US Navy SEAL snipers ended the hostage ordeal of American Richard Phillips, captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama , which had been hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean five days earlier . Talks with the pirates ended when they threw the phone used to communicate with negotiators into the ocean . When one of the pirates pointed his rifle at Captain Phillips' back , snipers shot and killed all three in near simultaneous fashion . Captain Phillips was unharmed . Heartbreaking failures . In 2005, US Delta Force operators rescued Roy Hallums, an American civilian contractor kidnapped by an al-Qaeda cell in Iraq, after 311 days in captivity . Again , the intelligence as to Hallums' location was exact - pull up the kitchen carpet and open the faux cement trap door leading into his one room cell . Hallums was unharmed in the operation . But , as was all too evident on Saturday, there are heartbreaking failures, too . This past July, US special operations forces attempted to rescue James Foley in Syria . Unfortunately, the intelligence as to where he was being held was incorrect . Foley was brutally murdered by ISIL just a few weeks later , the videotape of which was released on the internet for the world to see . In 2010, the US special operations team attempting to rescue her in Afghanistan accidentally killed Linda Norgrove, a British citizen . There are other failures, all tragic, as well . But there are also other successes , where hostages like Jessica Buchanan, Poul Thisted, Captain Phillips and Roy Hallums, all of whom faced indefinite captivity or even death, are home with their families because decisions were made to rescue them based on calculated risks . No guessing, no maybes, no \"let's keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best\" . Rescue missions are risky, both for the hostages and for the operators who carry them out . Lives are at stake , and it's never an easy choice to give the \"green light\" . But given the circumstances, particularly when dealing with terrorist organisations, leaders can't always sit back and wait to see what happens . Sometimes, it's less risky to act than not to . And in the case of a hostage rescue operation, I'd place my life in the hands of men dedicated to the task before taking my chances with the likes of a terrorist in the hope that maybe they'll let me go .",

            "input": "Fearmongering in Sydney. Australians turning on their televisions Monday morning to watch breakfast and cooking shows were instead greeted with news channels beaming minute-to-minute fearmongering of the ongoing siege at a chocolate shop in Sydney . When customers and employees were taken hostage by a lone gunman , and a flag with\"There is only one God\" inscription in Arabic was held in the window , it was enough to hold the rest of the country hostage to their fears and TV screens . Should it be that way and what should an appropriate response look like? First ,  consider what this violent thug had designed our reaction to be . The site of the siege was likely no afterthought - located in the heart of the Sydney CBD and directly opposite a major television station, the shop had made it ideal for the media to report on . Streets were cordoned off , public transport diverted , and a strong contingent of police sent to the Opera House . All made for good visuals of the incident and terror in an otherwise peaceful city . Even the most left-leaning and progressive members of parliament, like Greens MP Adam Bandt, who have repeatedly defended the Muslim community from unjust discrimination and generalisation, tweeted to their followers in the first hours of the siege that it was \"terrifying\" . Was it really? Was it at all terrifying for you personally, Adam? If it was , I'd hate to know what the hostages experienced, including the two who were murdered . A strike in the public's dark . For once, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a more mature response than his colleagues on the opposite side . Such a situation can \"scare people out of being themselves\", he said in his first press briefing, before urging all Australians to go about their business as usual . Although he told the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities , he said so with calm and caution . Vitally, he avoided using the t-word at this early stage, or any formulation thereof . No doubt we have since learnt a lot more about this deranged outsider and his motives , and it is clear he had terrorist intent . His website, which was shut down during the final hours of the siege, had a message dated December 14, which described why Muslims \"fight against the oppression and terrorism\" of the US and its allies, including the UK and Australia . The rampant speculation before this was unnecessary and unhelpful, however , and letting the siege sow fear, enough so to publicly describe it as \"terrifying\", was handing a victory to an extremist . With the hot Australian summer setting in, many people's minds turn to beer, barbeques, family, and Christmas presents, not the possibility of \"politically motivated violence\", as Abbott wisely phrased it . Intriguingly, Australians fear terrorism more than a foreign invasion, despite many believing we'd have no hope of fending off the latter and despite us never directly experiencing the former . Given the opportunity to attribute a complexly motivated act to terrorism , it's no wonder this all-too-easy escape mechanism which avoids rigorous thought or objective analysis was adopted en masse . The most noted incidents in Australia's experience of terrorism have been mostly foreign tragedies, like the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, or the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta . Although the September raids and arrests of suspected domestic terrorists in Sydney and Brisbane set a new landscape and brought the thought of an attack to our own shores , they merely raised the thought, not the authentic actuality . The raids sparked limited local backlash against peaceful Muslims at the time , and this was both unwarranted and unwanted . Though it only goes to further support my thesis ; Australians just aren't used to this sort of thing and thus are unpractised in their response . That said , it hasn't stopped thousands on social media to show solidarity with minorities through the #IllRideWithYou campaign . When the Abbott government raised the domestic terrorism threat level to high before the September raids , many local commentators criticised what they branded as political theatre (both before and after the arrests) . To consider this is to suggest an even baser type of political animal than is presently expected by even the most cynical of observers . Would any rational actor toy with people's lives for short-term political ends in what was an unimportant political week? What end does that even achieve? Plainly, none, and it is sensationally conspiratorialist to suggest otherwise . To protest against such raids and continue looking at them through a political lens was just as unwarranted and unwanted as the racial-profiling and racial- hatred which events like these have sparked . Terrorism isn't something that we should let foster, anywhere , and the public reactions to the raids were unjustifiably sceptical in comparison to the response to the Sydney siege . Even so ,  the authorities' heed for caution may have come too late for some . Slipshod media reports that the flag held in the shop window was an ISIL flag - when it was not- may have already fuelled the imaginations of too many . Whatever the outcome of the full investigation, one thing remains clear : This was a tragic learning experience for the Australian media, public, and politicians . Keep calm and carry on, though pay a thought or two to how we ought to respond to events like these in the future .",

In conjunction with the joint military action against Islamic State (Isis), Tony Abbott has pledged $5m in humanitarian aid for Iraq on his recent surprise visit to Baghdad . But don't be fooled by the government's apparent show of generosity - Australia isn't giving any more to foreign aid than it was before . In fact ,  it is giving significantly less . It is vitally important that we don't stop talking about recent cuts to foreign aid . The government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history . Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years . In addition to the $7.6bn already cut in May's federal budget, foreign aid has been cut by one quarter . If the government is serious about tackling terrorist threats and defending \"universal values\" , cutting off foreign aid to programmes that provide education, reduce poverty and improve gender equality is one of the worst ways to go about it . The Save Australian Aid campaign states that $11bn in foreign aid - the amount cut from the foreign aid budget in the past year - is the equivalent of 2 million children who may not be able to enrol in school, 1.4 million births without a birth attendant, 3.7 million children who may not receive vaccinations, 4.7 million people who will have reduced access to safe water, and almost 22 million people with reduced assistance in emergency situations . These cuts further perpetuate the idea that Australia is not a team player, a notion fuelled by our past behaviour towards our neighbours, and our recent denials of international obligations towards asylum seekers and climate change . In addition to the cuts in the Myefo, Australia backed out of commitments made to tax justice in the recent G20 summit . It is estimated that developing nations lose $160bn per year to corporate tax dodging; an amount that would end world hunger three times over . The G20 commitment, Abbott said, was \"about the countries of the world, the people of the world, receiving the tax benefits that are their due and it's needed so that governments can fund the infrastructure and the services that people expect and deserve.\" As the host of the G20, backing out of this commitment not only damages our international credibility, but also has a huge impact on the developing world . The foreign aid cuts are irresponsible, but not surprising . Cutting the aid budget sends a clear message to our developing neighbours that Australia won't lend a helping hand unless it's in our own best interest . However ,  our politicians seem to forget that there is something in it for us, and not only in Iraq . Aid is much more than a humanitarian gesture ; it's a tool for regional development, trust and cooperation . Foreign aid programmes promote stability through education and equality, in turn reducing conflict . As an added bonus, foreign aid and sustainable development programmes create stronger economies , which in turn create opportunities at home and abroad . Poverty breeds hopelessness and despair , which are both contributing factors to extremist behaviour . Foreign aid is not the only factor in answering this issue , but it's more than a step in the right direction . Higher levels of foreign aid have the potential not to only alleviate extreme poverty in our region, but to raise international opinion of Australia as a fair country . A recent study examining the effects of foreign aid on foreign public opinion found that US aid programmes targeting HIV/Aids have improved perceptions of the US among the public in recipient countries . Australia would reap these benefits as a side effect of foreign aid, saving the millions of dollars set aside to \"stop the boats\" and wage a \"war on terror\" . But our government has, predictably, made yet another irresponsible decision with untold repercussions . While two innocent people died in Martin Place on 16 December in what has been labelled an act of terror , a reduction of this size in the foreign aid budget will result in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds across the globe due to reduced access to vital services . The high priority the Abbott government has placed on security doesn't come cheap, with funds for anti-terrorism programmes costing billions of dollars . Wouldn't this money be better spent reducing inequality, poverty, and conflict? Shouldn't we be stopping the problem at the source, not trying to cure the symptoms?",

            "input": "If Greece turns left, will Europe follow? Greece is heading towards snap elections on January 25 after the conservative coalition government, currently in office, failed to reach a supermajority of 180 MPs in order to elect the new president of the republic as dictated by the Greek constitution . Stavros Demas, a former European Commissioner and candidate of choice of the two ruling parties, was never really proposed with the purpose to achieve and express the maximum consensus among the Greek population . Demas is coming from the heart of the ruling conservative New Democracy party and symbolises the party's loyalty to the current establishment in the EU . The main opposition party, SYRIZA, openly invested in the constitutional opportunity to overturn the government months ago claiming that its endurance in office for two more years would be abnormal as it would contradict the popular sentiment tracked in every opinion poll during the past year or so . By all odds , SYRIZA is leading the polls by 3 percent to 10 percent and is expected to form a government either based on a robust majority of the left in parliament, or, in coalition with minor parties who are willing to follow its agenda, renegotiate a bailout agreement that will not be catastrophic for Greek society and the Greek economy . Despite the fact that both the German and the Greek conservative governments present the current bailout programme as a \"success story\", most analysts around the globe agree that it has actually failed . Six years of continuing recession have resulted in a loss of 25 percent of GDP and a rise of unemployment to 27 percent . Greek debt is well over 170 percent of GDP now and according to Troika estimations it will be no less than 120 percent by 2020 . These facts translate to two things . Firstly , there can be no development under austerity policies for the majority of the population , even if the Eurozone fixes its competitiveness problem and exits deflation and the Greek economy starts developing at a growth rate of over 4 percent  - which is highly unlikely . Secondly, there can be no functioning democracy so long as Greece is not given choices other than poverty, degrowth and exclusion . Greece is in the state of protectorate at the moment, bound in a bailout agreement that strips its ability to produce and reject different solutions . But it's not just Greece . Spain follows the same path both in regards to the social crisis and the political management of that crisis . Poverty and unemployment figures look much like the Greek ones and the Spanish conservative government resorts to authoritarian measures in order to keep the Spanish society tight . For example ,  the public security law voted a few days ago is a clear attempt of the government to muzzle protests over its handling of the financial crisis . Deflation hits Europe and the prospects of its biggest economies like France's, Italy's and Germany's, are not looking good to pull the Eurozone back to the track of growth . As a result, political forces that question austerity are gaining momentum whether they are nationalist Euroskeptic and even fascist, or progressive, democratic and pro-European like the Spanish ally party of SYRIZA, Podemos . What is striking about SYRIZA is that its critique and analysis since 2009 have been proven to be correct despite the continuing fear campaign against him both inside and out of the country . Recently Prime Minister Antonis Samaras accused the party of the radical left that it will lead Greece to default and bankruptcy if it tries to negotiate lighter terms for the repayment of the Greek debt . Jean Claude Juncker's Commission has been issuing exhortations to the Greek electorate not to vote for SYRIZA and German finance minister is openly saying that there is no alternative for Greece, no matter which government comes in office . But economic analysts who have defended the reforms are starting to agree with SYRIZA on several issues, including the need to stop austerity and move faster to a process of debt forgiveness . FT's Wolfgang Munchau writes that \"the radical left is right about Europe's debt\" . Bloomberg argues that the end of austerity may boost the global economy and even Morgan Stanley asks bond holders not to be afraid of the coming elections . Despite the fear-mongering campaign, economic analysts reject now a possible \"grexit\" due to markets' belief that some kind of deal is preferable both for Greece and the EU . In this environment, a SYRIZA victory would mean two very important things; the return of the power to decide to a democratically elected government and the restoration of inclusiveness and national sovereignty and the opening of a new chapter in European politics , where the parties and the organisations who challenge austerity will have the momentum . The Greek people have patiently given the opportunity to the neoliberal technocrats of the IMF and the EU along with their local counterparts in the conservative coalition government to experiment and find a way out of the mess for more than five years only to receive back pain and failure . Now they're being given the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to choose which way the country will turn . SYRIZA is asking for debt forgiveness and a New Deal for Europe, both rather moderate demands coming from a radical left party . If SYRIZA actually wins the elections , the Greek people will be the first to send a clear message against austerity, one that can spark change, much needed on the continent right now . And if SYRIZA succeeds then Europe may start a new page in its economic and political history .",

            "input": "More immigration and population growth? London can take it. Listen to the doomsayers, the scaremongers and the Farage brigade, and you would be forgiven for thinking that London is full . Our capital, just like our country, they say, can't cope with any more people . Everything from traffic jams to NHS waiting times is blamed on immigrants . The only answer, they tell us, is to pull up the drawbridge and close our borders, turning our back on the globalised world that this country did so much to create . How, then, do they explain the fact that, according to forecasts, only today will London's population surpass that of 1939 - topping 8.6 million for the first time? It is a stark rebuttal of the frequently peddled myth that says London must stop growing . Instead of the huge influx of immigrants that headlines wrongly report, in reality the capital's population has only gradually been creeping back to the level of 75 years ago, before the blitz destroyed many parts of the city . Today, though, shows more than just the falsity of the immigration scare stories - it highlights the huge success of London as a city . Our capital continues to attract people from all over the country and all over the globe because of the opportunities it offers : to find work, set down roots, enjoy a world-class cultural scene and be accepted regardless of who you are and where you come from . That success should be a cause of great celebration, not something to curse and try to curtail . But no one should deny the pressures that come with a growing population - pressures that are particularly acute in the capital . London is in the midst of the deepest housing crisis in decades , as average house prices soar to 14 times the average salary and rents rise uncontrollably . The city's transport system is struggling to cope with demand, with commuters crammed into conditions in which it would be illegal to transport livestock, and fares rising year on year . The opportunities to get a decent job, buy a house, and enjoy all the city has to offer are becoming fewer . The reality is becoming detached from the dream . These problems arise not because of growing demand alone but because of the failure of political leaders to respond to it . Londoners have a right to expect more from their mayor than the 17,000 new homes that were built in the capital last year - less than a third of the 63,000 a year that are needed to solve the city's housing crisis . That Boris Johnson has missed his own affordable housing targets in every year of his mayoralty is an abject failure of political leadership . The government's unwillingness to commit to vital transport infrastructure, such as Crossrail 2 and new Thames bridges, is scarcely better . History shows us what can be achieved when politicians take population growth seriously and rise to the challenges it creates . In the midst of the second world war, even as bombs fell and the city burned, a plan was devised to respond to London's growth . The Abercrombie plan, officially called the Greater London plan, laid out an ambitious vision for a new postwar London: decent housing replacing slums, efficient transport, full employment, new parks and open spaces . It was a radical and comprehensive document that provided the detail for rebuilding London after the devastation of the war . New towns including Stevenage and Crawley were built in the south-east ; modern transport infrastructure, including the north and south circular roads, was planned to cope with the increasing number of cars . The requirements of a successful London were drawn up and implemented . A growing population and new pressures on services mean we need a new, equally ambitious plan today . Empty words about more homes and better jobs will not cut it ; they are no substitute for a serious and detailed proposal for building at least 63,000 homes a year and rebalancing the city's economy to create jobs and opportunities for Londoners while continuing to invest in the industries of tomorrow . The city's creaking transport system must be upgraded, with Crossrail 2 and other new infrastructure built . This must happen without the continuous and excessive raising of fares , which burns holes in Londoners' pockets . Keeping London affordable for ordinary people must be central to the plan, and improving the quality of life of Londoners a core theme . Given that London successfully adapted to growing demands in the middle of a world war, we can be optimistic about our chances of doing the same today . We should not let those with a political agenda use London's growing population to support their anti-immigration rhetoric , and we should challenge those who want to label London's global attraction a flaw rather than a strength . That our capital is back at its peak population is a sign of its success as a great global city . People from all corners of the globe still take great risks, at great expense, to become Londoners and to benefit from the city's opportunities . But this isn't a time for complacency . Whoever the next mayor is, they must focus their gaze on solving the problems that stem from growing demand on London's infrastructure . As population continues towards 10 million , we need a new plan to take London forward together according to the qualities of the city at its best : inclusive, diverse, ambitious, forward-looking and offering a wealth of opportunities to all who live here .",

            "input": "India's mass conversion problem. \"Homecoming\" in the Christmas season is supposed to be a joyous occasion, accompanied by camaraderie and cheer . Not so for the small community of Christians in Agra, a town in the northern Indian province of Uttar Pradesh . On Christmas Eve, the flock of believers were cowering in fear , because a couple of churches were burnt and there was the looming threat of more skirmishes with the belligerent among their Hindu brethren spiralling into serious communal clashes . More portentous was the grand ghar wapsi (homecoming, or mass-reconversion) programme announced by the Dharam Jagran Samiti (loosely translated into Hindi-Religious Awakening Front) in the neighbouring town of Aligarh , where Christmas was to be \"celebrated\" by bringing 4,000 Christians and 1,000 Muslims back into the folds of Hinduism . This Samiti, a not-so-small wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a militant Hindu organisation, contended that far from propagating religious intolerance, it was only righting historical wrongs and injustice perpetrated by Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics who, in order to bolster the numbers of their respective faiths, had lured and coerced Hindus to stray from their original religion . Attack on secularism . When these turn of events created a furore in parliament , the Narendra Modi- led central government instructed the local administration to thwart the Samiti's grandiose plans, and Christmas day went peacefully . But ,  the solution - a national legislation to ban and criminalise conversions - assertively advocated by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which commands an absolute majority in parliament, and despite repeated disavowals, remains rooted in essentially a chauvinistic, right-wing Hindu ideology, is far more disconcerting, and if implemented , would deal a grievous blow to the constitutional ideal of secularism . It would be downright specious, even dishonest, to claim that missionaries and proselytisers' activities in India had nothing but a salubrious effect . Historical records bear ample testimony to the rigorous implementation of St Caprion's axiom - \"extra ecclessium nulla salus\" (outside the Church, no salvation), even by the proverbial fire and sword, especially by explorer-cum- conquistadors like Vasco da Gama, the tales of whose brutalities in enforcing a harvest of faith in the erstwhile Portuguese-controlled state of Goa are legion . Active proselytisation was an integral part of the colonial project ; indeed , as historian Ranajit Guha states,\"the Bible and the toothbrush were one of the main instruments of the British colonialists\" . This reveals that the missionaries did bring \"material\" gifts to the native population - especially western medicine and hygiene . But these benefits aside, there was another more substantive reason why many Indians, especially the Dalits (Untouchables) and tribals embraced Christianity, and even Islam . Both these religions liberate them, or at least hold out the promise of unshackling them from the pernicious burden of the caste-system which is so deeply entrenched in Hinduism . Though ostensibly secular in objective, the anti-conversion laws in force in various states of India - Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh (all areas with a significantly high population of tribals, Dalits, the depressed castes, and reeling from poverty, illiteracy and abysmal healthcare) in effect gives the government a vast swathe of control over people's choices in matters of faith and religion . Going way beyond , they endow the government with surveillance powers over a constituency of people . Starting from the premise that the freedom of religion and religious chose of \"those who are converted\"(note; the laws never say \"those who convert\") need to be protected from incursions of proselytisers - the various anti-conversion legislations, ironically termed as \"freedom of religion\" laws - make it mandatory for the convertees to inform the head of the district administration . They will then give the go-ahead only once he is satisfied that one is not swapping religions for monetary benefits or other inducements, or by being taken in by fraud, or being swayed by either promises of salvation or threats of incurring divine displeasure, as the case may be . The laws of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh make it incumbent upon neighbours or villagers to inform the administration and the police of any activities of pastors, nuns and clergymen which could give rise to a suspicion of proselytising motives . Without defining what all would, and could, possibly count as \"inducement\" or \"fraud\", these laws impose stringent criminal sanctions on violators . Anyone found guilty is visited with imprisonment extending to three years, and with a financial penalty of 50,000 rupees (approximately $800) . Tellingly, the punishment is doubled if those who convert are women, or members of the lower castes and tribal communities . These laws are invoked and enforced only when a group of people, not individuals, seek to move out of Hinduism . One might well question - in face of such provisions, do the laws even need to use the modifiers \"forcible\" or \"fraudulent\"? Also ,  not a single legislation even addresses, let alone punish, \"reconversion\" which the many Hindu zealots are painstakingly claiming as totally voluntary and a righteous reply to the violation of rights by colonisers and their ilk . Indians look up to the judiciary to uphold the secular values of the republic , and the Supreme Court has, time and again, thwarted onslaughts on people's core fundamental right of religious freedom . But its record in adjudicating the evidently unsecular anti-conversion statutes is dubious . The last time it did was in 1977, in the Reverend Stanislaus case , wherein the Odisha and Madhya Pradesh statutes were upheld . Basing its ruling on a 1956 report entitled \"Report of the Christian Missionaries Activity Enquiry Commission\", which deemed proselytisation as a threat to India's territorial integrity and internal security, the court ended up conflating every act of propagation of one's faith - Christianity, in this case (enshrined as a fundamental right in the constitution) as an attack on Hinduism and its followers, tantamount to blasphemy , which, incidentally, is also a criminal offence in India . A national anti-conversion law, if enacted , would definitely be challenged in the Supreme Court . In that case, the judges could remedy the errors of 1977 by seeking inspiration from the European Court of Human Right's 1993 ruling in the Kokkinakis case , which struck the right balance between keeping out improper proselytism and Christians' right to practise, profess, and propagate their faith .",

The local communities are dependent on the forest for their livelihoods and it is also home to several rare and endangered species . But a portion of this reserve is earmarked for open cast coal mining by Essar, a British company registered in London . In order to mine for coal, they would need to cut down the forest and displace those who live there . Essar would destroy more than 1,000 hectares of pristine forests and the biodiversity that it supports, affecting 54 villages . It would also impact on the livelihoods of thousands more who depend on forest produce, and the wildlife, water and air in the region . For the last three years I have been helping villagers in Mahan to assert their rights, protect their forest, and prevent the open-cast coalmine development . Unfortunately, during this time, I have experienced a wide range of intimidation tactics . I have received anonymous phone calls threatening violence and been followed by a car without a number plate as I travelled to village meetings . Last year I discovered that a forged letter bearing my signature had been given to local media . It called on villagers to resort to violence while protesting against the mine . And Greenpeace India is currently appealing against a decision by the home ministry to freeze all its overseas funding, some 40% of its income . But Sunday marked a new low . I was due to travel to London to address British parliamentarians about my work with local Mahan communities , but I was not allowed to board my flight despite having valid travel documents . My passport was stamped with \"offloaded\" at the airport and I was asked to go home . The only explanation offered was that this was being done by the orders of the government of India . Since then, I have consulted lawyers and written to government agencies . I've had no official response , but some newspapers reported that I have been put on a \"blacklist\" or \"lookout list\" preventing me from leaving the country . Such lists are usually for those with criminal convictions and I don't have one . Refusing my travel to speak to British MPs with no legal reason to do so is an infringement on my fundamental rights, and a shocking blow to the strength and freedom of civil society in India . My travel was legitimate . Essar is based in London and I was invited by a British all-party parliamentary group to talk about my work and to present the social and environmental impacts of the project - otherwise known as freedom of speech . We are equally engaged with all major parties and relevant politicians and administrators in India on this issue . The fight in Mahan is about the rights of those people who live there and depend on the forest for their livelihoods . The local community is only asking that due process is followed : under Indian law there must be a local referendum and consent from the local community . But these laws have been bypassed , and now the government is reviewing major environmental laws, including the Forest Rights Act, that have been key in protecting forest dwellers . This is why a fight such as Mahan in India is critical . It's symptomatic of how India will act when it comes to making important decisions about forests, conservation, community rights and a sustainable way of development . The act of engaging all relevant stakeholders is part of my work as a Greenpeace member and indeed the responsibility of any vibrant civil society in any functional democracy . Travelling to London to meet British MPs was neither an attack on the Indian government, nor a violation of the laws of our country . Internationally, India is under a lot of pressure to make strong commitments to tackling climate change , yet it is drawn to the cheap and immediate gains of coal despite the high social and environmental cost . Groups such as Greenpeace are a vital check on the power of corporations and politicians . We fight for Indian values promoting empowered local communities and a clean environment for the next generation . And our campaigns, such as the push to get pesticides out of our tea, have been successful . That's why we're being attacked . In a week's time, Greenpeace India will find out if its appeal against the Indian government freezing its funding is successful . If not, other campaign groups will be next . Whatever the outcome, I will continue to support the rights of communities using all the democratic rights available to me . I will also continue to seek answers as to why I was blacklisted . One thing is clear ; without a legal basis to justify my detention, the government is on thin ice . As I write this, it is busy shifting blame from one department to another . As we say in Mahan, we will fight and we will win .",

            "input": "The internet is fertile ground for the mosaic of allegiances out of which teens build identity. Young people - at least weird young people, at very least weird young girls - are often eager to announce themselves . In lieu of a strong self-concept, the young build themselves out of a mosaic of allegiances . The online world is fertile ground for these . Tumblr, Twitter and 4chan, for example, are full of young people pledging fervent allegiance to a favorite fan culture, a political movement or a self-diagnosis, with all the rights, privileges, and rivalries that implies . Some of these will be important parts of a person's identity for life . Others will mortify them within a year . At that age, it can be very, very hard to tell which will be which . Building a self-concept means staking your claim for an audience, however small . I'm sure kids still write private stuff . But it's hard when you are young and lonely - no matter how many fandoms you join- to resist a readily- available audience that doubles as a support group . I wouldn't have been able to, I think : I wrote letters , but if there had been Tumblr back then , I would have been on it like scarves on Sherlock . The support of the invisible masses can be incredibly positive . For teens who are isolated physically or emotionally, the internet might provide the first glimmer of understanding that there's nothing actually wrong with them . It can be a way to connect with other people, to build support systems to which you don't have access in your offline life, a way to live and explore an identity that you might have to keep hidden or secret for your own protection . But there can also be pitfalls . Sometimes, when you're trying to figure out who you are and what you believe, you test out a lot of convictions . (I had an\"I hate feminists because they get mad when men hold doors for them\" phase, for example .) Once you've made those statements in public , it's harder to pull up, to nix one bit of the person you've created from scratch and go exploring down a different route . You've already told Tumblr that you are definitely, really a wolf with wings ; you've argued in favor of Otherkin rights and awareness ; you've become a leader of the Otherkin community . Or worse, you've helped your 4chan buddies dox a female game developer and your rape-threat tweets are screencapped and re-tweeted all over the internet . You've pledged allegiance , and everyone saw you do it . Now, when someone challenges you, you have to double down . The danger of overcommitting to passing thoughts by making them public isn't just a pitfall for teens . Adults do it all the time  - they make an offhanded comment and then make it worse with a defensive non-apology, or complain about an offhanded comment and set off the outrage machine . But the teen years are an identities factory, churning out new products right and left . You try out more opinions and self-concepts , and you're much more susceptible to peer pressure . It's perfect lab conditions for getting locked into an idea of yourself that would have otherwise been ephemeral . I'm not saying we should keep teenagers off the internet . Teens are the internet's beating heart , and they always have been ; an internet without teens doesn't bear thinking about . Besides ,  young people who are marginalized, or confused, or in any way lonely need to see that there is a whole world they can connect to- that there are people who share their problems, or maybe that their idiosyncrasies aren't problems at all . In an ideal world we'd keep adults off the internet instead, to preserve it as a space of identity experimentation for the people who really need that . Given that adults are unlikely to accept this idea , maybe we can all go back to using cute handles like LadyBloodrayne instead of our real names all the time . (I don't know, I was a goth .) If she embarrasses you , ditch her for TitaniaDarkwing! If she gets you in trouble , switch to EldritchAngel! Actually, don't : I like that one, and I'm keeping it . At any rate, I hope that young people - at least lonely, weird young people, at very least lonely weird young girls - occasionally resist some of their urges for public self-declaration . I hope they're writing emails to friends, even ones they've never met in person . In my ideal world they'd even take up writing letters again . Cobbling together an identity is a fraught, uncertain, often very retroactively embarrassing pursuit . I hope that the young weirdos of today can be kind enough to their future selves to draw a decorous veil over some of that floundering . At least until 20 years in the future, when it becomes funny again .",

            "input": "The Iranian opportunity. The instability and chaos sweeping across the Arab world today represents both a threat and an opportunity for Iran . Instability in Yemen, Libya, Syria and Iraq are case-in-point examples that Iran can realise its short and long-term objectives to become the region's main hegemon . Surrounded by countries with significant Shia minorities, Iran seeks to cultivate the image of \"protector state\" for these populations . And eventually, Iran could become the \"core country\" in this hotly contested region . Toward this end, Iran has stirred Shia-Sunni divisions, creating sectarian identities for the various clashing groups . In the case of Yemen, this was done within the borders of one country where Iran contrived to create a distinct Shia identity for the Houthis who ended up taking control over the course of the past few months . The Iranian strategy is focused on building a new political model in the region - one that relies on Iran's \"centrality\" through which it can exercise power and influence both on the regional and international levels . Especially after the election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Iran has been keen to develop working relations with the West and the US (particularly with regard to \"fighting terrorism\" - as it had done before in Afghanistan) . It is also eager to play a similar role in Iraq . This Iranian eagerness, however, cannot be isolated from the larger vision . This vision sees such cooperation as advancing the Iranian model of emphasising its geopolitical centrality for Shiism, as well as its hegemonic desires over the region, including the Arab Sunni states . To become the centre of gravity of the Middle East, Iran needs to amplify its role as both a protector and hegemon for its much weaker and unstable Arab neighbours . These neighbours would be relegated within the Iranian model to the status of periphery states . To do that, Iran uses its old revolutionary rhetoric and slogans to describe its brand of Islam as \"authentic and original\" while describing pro-West Sunni Arab states as having an \"American-Islam\" , which it presents as an illegitimate form of Islam . In his Washington Post op-ed last September, \"Time to Engage\", Rouhani outlined the Iranian objectives and the key areas in which Iran can cooperate with the US and the West . Although Rouhani laid out the Iranian strategic perspective and the parameters through which Iran can work and cooperate with the West , there was an important point, which he left unsaid . He was essentially saying that the US must recognise the failure of its old policies, especially in the region, and at the same time tacitly acknowledged that Iran had made mistakes in dealing with the US during the past eight years . Nevertheless ,  he opened the door for US-Iranian cooperation on combating terrorism and emphasised the Iranian role in solving the region's thorniest problems, such as the Palestinian cause and the conflict with Israel . View of superiority . Current Iranian discourse - political and cultural - revolves around advancing the view of superiority of the Iranian race, Shia Islam, and Iranian culture . Such discourse focuses on the uniqueness of the Iranian race as one that is steeped in civilisation, juxtaposed with the Arabs who represent, according to this view, the \"other\", i.e  less civilised . In realpolitik terms, amid the instability and chaos plaguing Arab states, Iran presents itself as the alternative power to fill the vacuum in the region . From the Iranian perspective, the US has failed to solve many of the international crises and in some cases, it has created them . Iran, in this respect, is positioning itself as a rising power that will replace the US as the dominant power in the region . Echoing such discourse, Kazem Sajjadpour, an advisor on Strategic Affairs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran said, in Persian, during his participation in the roundtable discussion on the website Shia News Association, that while the Arab world suffers from fragmentation and strategic paralysis - while under the influence of western powers- Iran enjoys territorial integrity and cohesiveness, and is endowed with strategic resources . All of these are factors that could make Iran the new rising power in the region . Indeed ,  Iran is making the case that the entire Arab world revolves around it - and cannot survive without it .",

            "input": "Iran: A not so unlikely ally. Following the reports of Iranian aircraft attacking ISIL targets last week, Iranian and US officials issued statements to emphasise that they are not coordinating their air strikes . Despite these denials, there is an ironic element to this strike that both sides cannot deny . The Islamic Republic of Iran used US-produced, Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom aircraft against a common foe, ISIL . Contextualising these Iranian air strikes within the greater history of how these planes ended up in the Iranian air force in the first place demonstrates a geostrategic reality for US foreign policy : Iran's geographical depth means the US has needed Iran during both the Cold War and post-Cold War era, regardless of the government in Tehran . The Islamic Republic's fleet of F-4s and F-14s were inherited from the Royal Iranian Air Force of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi . Iran under the shah was one of the few US allies that could purchase the advanced F-14 Tomcat interceptor of \"Top Gun\" fame, with one of the most sophisticated radars at the time . The shah's shopping list of US-supplied aircraft boosted the economy of the US defence industry, as well as served US geopolitical interests during the Cold War . Iran's advanced military allowed it to emerge as a regional hegemon . Since it shared a long border with the Soviet Union , the shah's armed forces served as a bulwark against Communist penetration in the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf region, and a deterrent against an anti-western Baathist Iraq . Iran's geostrategic location has not diminished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union . No US or NATO ally, including Israel, Turkey or Saudi Arabia can cover Iran's geographical depth . Iran's location means it can influence events from Iraq to the Gulf, from the Caucasus and adjoining Caspian and Black Seas to Central Asia, and from Afghanistan to South Asia . Video footage . The video footage released by Al Jazeera of Iranian F-4s attacking ISIL forces in Iraq's Diyala province is reminiscent of another attack when two of the same US-supplied Iranian aircraft bombed Iraq's nuclear facility in Tuwaitha in 1980, during the first year of the Iran-Iraq War . In this first air strike, the US and the Islamic Republic shared the same interests, albeit for different purposes . The Islamic Republic feared Iraq could develop a nuclear option as it fought a two-front war for its survival, including a domestic Iranian Kurdish uprising, and a potential pro-shah counterrevolution launched from within the Iranian air force - the same unit that was needed to target Iraq . The US, despite its tensions with Iran during the hostage crisis, did not want to see Iraq develop a nuclear capability that could threaten its ally Israel during the 1980s . Israel successfully followed up the attack against Iraq's nuclear facility in 1981 , and the US-led air strikes during the 1991 Gulf war were designed to destroy this nuclear infrastructure again , which had been rebuilt despite the Israeli air raid . Thus the air raid Iran conducted against ISIL was not the first time both Washington and the Islamic Republic might have both wished for a successful sortie of Iranian F-4 pilots . Despite this common interest during the Iran-Iraq War, the US titled towards Iraq and directly engaged Iranian naval forces in the Gulf to protect Kuwaiti oil vessels, downing an Iranian civilian aircraft in the process . Iran fought a proxy war against US forces in Iraq following the 2003 Iraq war by supporting Iraqi militias during the insurgency . Both the US and Iran will continue to clash over their respective relationships with Israel . Yet despite these differences both the US and Iran cooperated with each other to remove the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 . The joint cause against the Taliban in 2001, or ISIL in 2014, demonstrates that despite the decades-long mistrust and proxy conflicts between the two sides, geographical realpolitik can force both states to engage in alliances of convenience . In an AP interview, the new US ambassador in Baghdad, Stuart Jones said,\"Let's face it. Iran is an important neighbour to Iraq. There has to be cooperation between Iran and Iraq.\" Such a statement is significant . The Iranian government has been trying to force the US to concede this geographic fact since 2003 . Indirect evidence . This statement serves as indirect evidence that the US and Iran appear to have worked out a modus vivendi in dealing with ISIL in Iraq . Yet when Al Jazeera released the video of the air strike, the Iranian government initially denied the report, only to confirm it days later, adding the caveat that it was launched at the behest of the central government in Iraq . The initial denial raises the question as to whether Iran did not want to upset this alliance of convenience with US by launching its own air strikes . In this case, rather than upsetting the US, both the Iranian and Iraqi governments probably wanted to keep this air strike quiet for domestic Iraqi politics . The close cooperation between the post-2003 Iraqi government and Iran has been criticised by critics within Iraq over the last decade as a surrender of Baghdad to \"Safavis\", a reference to the 16th century Shia dynasty in Iran that tried to secure what is today Iraq from the Ottomans . This footage, along with pictures of Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Quds Force, training Iraqi forces on Iranian equipment used by both the Iraqi military and Shia militias, have only alienated Iraq's disenfranchised communities with whom Baghdad needs to ultimately reconcile . This modus vivendi over Iraq will hinge on the future of the ongoing nuclear negotiations and the Syrian civil war . But in both cases, there could be an endgame that resolves the mutual antagonisms between Iran and the US . Media coverage acknowledges that despite Iranian-US cooperation in Iraq, they still support rival sides in the Syrian civil war . However ,  even in that conflict, they do share a mutual desire for that conflict to end with a political solution . Such a solution will save Iran from the huge financial costs of subsidising the Syrian military and end a conflict that the US has been hesitant to engage in since its onset in the summer of 2011 . Al Jazeera's correspondent in Iraq, Imran Khan, in an article in November raised the question: Are the US and Iran on the same side in Iraq? The answer to this question is not only a \"yes\" in Iraq, but could also be a \"yes\" in terms of the long-term stability of Syria and Afghanistan . It is domestic politics in both the US and Iran that prevent any official from saying this publicly .",

            "input": "Iran Sanctions Fight: Three myths no lawmaker should believe. The expected congressional vote on a new sanctions bill against the Iranian regime has rekindled debate over Tehran's nuclear defiance and the best way to confront it . Congress has misgivings about a rogue regime intent on obtaining nuclear capability, and understandably wants to ensure that Washington does not strike a bad deal . Some argue that a decisive approach toward Tehran will be counterproductive . But their position ignores historical lessons and stands on a number of myths that need to be debunked . Myth #1 : More sanctions on Iran will prompt the regime to unilaterally walk away from the talks . Iran cannot afford to walk away because it is desperate and vulnerable . It has a genuine interest to secure the lifting of existing sanctions , which provided the initial impetus for the regime to talk . Then ,  too, cynics argued that sanctions would prompt Tehran to accelerate its nuclear activities . The regime is playing a game of attrition, aiming to weaken U.S  resolve, win more concessions, and maintain its nuclear infrastructure . The bipartisan sanctions bill will force Tehran to consider speedy compliance . This month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated,\"Breaking the anti- Iran sanctions is the only way to achieve national progress,\" acknowledging that Iran's devastated economy cannot endure the weight of further sanctions, especially after the recent decline in oil prices . The mullahs are paranoid of a disenchanted population already on edge . With rampant unemployment, inflation, and loss of oil revenues, walking away from the talks is not an option , especially if a sanctions-in-waiting bill is hovering over their head . Myth #2 : With more sanctions, Tehran will blame Washington for sabotaging diplomacy, and start on the path towards war . Even with slumping oil revenues - slashed by at least 45%- the official defense budget has jumped 30%, mostly allocated to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) . And , more money is being funneled into Syria and Iraq to execute Tehran's designs - a budget that is twice that of all the country's publically funded universities combined . If sanctions fail to force Tehran to abandon key parts of its nuclear program after over a year of negotiations , then continued talks with no additional leverage will fail as well . The IAEA still has no access to suspect nuclear sites and its questions remain unanswered . IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said in November 2014, \"Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures, nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency.\" Senior U.S  officials have repeatedly stated that even without additional sanctions the chances for reaching an agreement with Iran is less that 50 percent . So , as Iran tries to wear out western negotiators , clearly, additional leverage from Congress is necessary, not counterproductive . Myth #3 : New sanctions will strengthen \"hardliners\" in Iran who want to sabotage a prospective deal . This is perhaps the most enduring myth in Washington that has dangerously infected Iran policy . The idea that there are moderate elements in Iran's body politic, and the U.S  needs to reach out to them by making more concessions is ludicrous . The oft-cited dichotomy between \"hardliners\" and \"moderates\" in Iran badly misrepresents a system whose elements are united in their strategic objectives . Rouhani, himself a longtime confidant of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was instructed by the latter to sign onto the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013 . Foreign Minister Zarif told the Iranian Parliament earlier this month that he has the full trust of Khamenei to continue the negotiations . Experience has shown that diplomacy without leverage has never worked with dictators, especially in Tehran . This puts Congress on the right path . The sanctions bill can be a game- changer . It will strengthen Washington's hand while helping to peacefully arrest Tehran's advance towards the bomb . One thing is for certain : Tehran's nuclear objective is anything but a myth .",

            "input": "Iran talks: Moving beyond 'worn out' policies. The stakes are high in the latest round of nuclear talks starting today in Geneva between Iran and the P5+1 at the deputy foreign minister level . Over the past week, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Jawed Zarif have held long conversations in Geneva and Paris, lasting over seven hours . Both realise that more flexibility is required to avoid the break up of the talks . British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke on the subject with US President Barack Obama and the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the EU foreign policy chief all held talks separately with Zarif . Yet if both sides continue to stick to their strict red lines it is questionable whether this round of talks will be any better than the last . It may be time for more flexible red lines if failure is to be avoided . \"Chances are less than 50/50,\" admits Obama, in a joint press conference with the British Prime Minister David Cameron when both leaders spent well over half of their press conferences spelling out what was at stake if a deal with Iran was not finalised by the June deadline . Obama explained how\"the most successful, the most effective sanctions regime\" had eventually led Iran to the negotiating table . He said:\"If we can get a verifiable deal with the necessary assurances then that would be the best deal.\" Yet Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said sanctions are a \"worn out policy\" and asked the White House to adopt a \"logical approach\" . Iran would not accept a deal that constrains its enrichment programme without the West reducing sanctions . \"Now we have come to a stage in the talks that requires the other side to take its decision to enable us to move forward,\" said Zarif when arriving in Geneva . \"There needs to be some new and comprehensive proposals.\" The latest directive from Iran's leader, Ali Khamenei is that officials \"should take away the weapon of sanctions from the enemy\" . \"Even one step in retreat will lead to enemy's advance,\" he said . He is angered that \"Americans say flagrantly that even if Iran withdraws in the nuclear issue, the sanctions will not be lifted all together and at once\" . Khamenei is referring to the main point of contention; the issue of the period of curbing Iran's enrichment programme in exchange for the lifting of four sets of sanctions imposed on Iran by the UN, EU and the US . The US wants the curbing of sanctions to be in a period covering well over 10 years, closer to 20 or in \"double digits\" as US administration officials put it . This is to ensure Iran's breakout time is prolonged . Iran sees this as an attempt for forcing it to forego what it calls its peaceful enrichment programme . It does not accept this long period of curbing its enrichment programme without the reciprocal reduction in sanctions . It is believed that the Iranian leader could be persuaded with anything below 10 years or a timeframe in a \"single digit\" . \"Iran is deeply suspicious of the US and the West,\" said Obama . Mutual distrust is at the core of the failure of the unwillingness on both side to be flexible . Khamenei still refers to the US as\"enemy\" and the US continues to refuse to lift sanctions fearing Iran's return to enrichment . It is not clear if western trust has taken another blow from reports that Syria is still trying to make nuclear weapons and has been getting help from Iran and North Korea . The two sides would not be able to reach an agreement especially when the US Congress is pushing daily for imposing further sanctions in support of the Israeli lobby . Republican Senator Mark Kirk and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez are finalising a bill for tougher sanctions . Senator Bob Corker is also working on a bill to ensure the congress must approve any final deal with Iran . Iran hardliners answer sanctions with the threat of enrichment . \"Further sanctions will result in a vote in the Iranian parliament for continuing enrichment,\" said Ali Larijani, the head of Judiciary . \"The enemies wanted to deprive Iran from its right to the nuclear technology and even resorted to military threats to this end.\" Hardline members of parliament are proposing a bill to increase the uranium enrichment programme to 60 percent . \"I am not, repeat, not suggesting that we are in immediate war footing, should negotiations with Iran fail,\" said Obama . At the same time he made it clear he would veto any congressional attempts at new sanctions against Iran . \"Hold your fire,\" he told the congress . \"We must not jeopardise the chance\" to get a verifiable deal with Iran . Although Republicans now hold a 54-46 seat majority in the Senate , it is not clear whether there would manage to get the 67 votes required in the Senate to override an Obama veto of any Iran legislation . In intensive meetings with his European counterpart, Zarif has no doubt conveyed to them that if there is no easing of the sanctions there would be little he could do back home . He has asked for \"serious and brave decisions\" in order to move forward . The world has heard expressions of commitments and hope from Iran and the countries P5+1 for over a year now . Yet those brave words must be coupled either with more flexibility as recommended by experts or coupled alternatively with new ideas, new methods and possibly new redlines . There is still time and several avenues are still open . For example there could be more direct involvement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in the form of a representative, a high calibre UN negotiator , who could add momentum to the talks and create synergy . Otherwise it is difficult to see how the negotiators can come up with a solution if they have not managed it in the past 14 months .",

            "input": "Islamic civilisation is in Europe's DNA. The brutal and tragic murders of 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris - 10 staff members and two police officers - by masked gunmen has triggered an outpouring of shock and grief, not only in France but around the world . Large, spontaneous vigils filled the streets of many French cities , while social media was awash with solidarity and condemnation, including the hashtags #JeSuisCharlie and #NotInMyName, which was used by Muslims condemning the attacks . Police in France have identified and released the photographs of two brothers suspected to be involved in the attack while early speculation focused on the premise that Muslim extremists were behind the dreadful act, especially given the magazine's long history of satirising Islam and other religions . The two brothers have been identified as 32-year-old Said Kouachi and 34-year-old Cherif Kouachi . This theory has been reinforced by eyewitness accounts of the men shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" . The designer who was forced to let the assailants in says they told her they were with al-Qaeda , while , according to AFP, the police claim that one of the killers remarked:\"We have avenged the prophet.\" Why Prophet Muhammad would need anyone to \"avenge\" him is beyond me . The prophet endured far more mockery, humiliation, insult and rejection during his lifetime without needing or ordering hitmen to defend his honour than that meted out by a group of equal-opportunity French cartoonists who despise and satirise all forms of organised religion . Even if ,  like with Anders Breivik in Norway, the perpetrators turn out not to be linked to Islamist groups , the collateral damage to French and European Muslims has already been done, despite one of the fallen police officers being a Muslim . With the strength of the Front National in France, UKIP in Britain and other anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant currents across Europe, a popular or populist backlash is almost inevitable . In neighbouring Germany, the thousands of Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) who have turned out to rallies, though still small enough to be labelled a \"flop\", has set alarm bells ringing to the extent that strong counter protests have taken place . Like Muslims who fantasise about an ahistorical caliphate, conservative Europeans who dream of a bygone utopia of a Europe uncontaminated by Islam or immigration, miss the reality that the \"Islamisation of the West\" occurred centuries ago . Islamic civilisation is so hard-wired into Europe's cultural, social and intellectual DNA that it would be impossible to expunge its influence . The same applies in the other direction, in light of Christendom's and the West's powerful influence on Arab and Islamic society . In addition to the philosophy, science, literature and art of the Muslim world which profoundly shaped the European Renaissance, Islamic culture had some far more unexpected and surprising influences on western civilisation . One man in particular, for whom no statues or memorials stand anywhere in Europe and very few westerners have heard of, is possibly the most unsung cultural, style and musical icon in European history . In the ninth century, Ziryab, Cordoba's most sought-after hipster, brought into vogue the idea of seasonal fashions, steering history's catwalk towards the fashion slavery of the 21st century . This Sultan of Style also added a fifth pair of strings to the Arab \"oud\", paving the way to the European lute , which would become the modern guitar . He also introduced Europe to the idea of dining etiquette, from table cloths and crystal decanters to the three-course meal . Fashion, fine food and rhythm are not what Europeans tend to associate with Muslims or Islam today . Instead ,  they are haunted by images of fundamentalists, not fun-loving eccentrics, and fanatics, not fans of refined culture . As someone who is well aware of the destructive influence of violent Islamism in the Middle East , I can, at a certain level, sympathise with fears in the West over radicalisation . But Islamic extremism is mostly a threat to Muslim societies, not to Europe , as a minority has never, in history, imposed its will on a majority, except in the form of a military conqueror . This exaggerated sense of threat can be seen in the enormous hysteria in segments of the media and among some politicians regarding the small trickle of European jihadists who have gone to fight in Syria . Although one gets the impression that Europe has sent forth a veritable Islamic army to the Levant , the real number is around 3,000 from across the continent, including the dead and returned, according to an estimate by Gilles de Kerchove, the EU's anti- terrorism chief . While it is important to be vigilant and to find effective ways to deal with the threat posed by returning fighters , society must steer clear of stigmatising Europe's already marginalised and distrusted Muslim communities . This is because it is unfair to blame an entire group for the behaviour of a tiny minority and it is also counterproductive , as marginalisation is a significant, but not the only, factor in radicalisation . In addition ,  the demonisation of minorities is what nurtures the truly threatening radicals in Europe's midst; the far-right and neo-Nazis . Since the end of World War II, Western Europe has worked consciously to build and celebrate diversity . Despite its weaknesses and failings, Europe needs to cherish, build and strengthen its multicultural experiment .",

French Muslims trained by Al Qaeda and inspired by the Islamic Caliphate murder seventeen people in Paris . Their announced reason is revenge for the defamation of the Prophet Muhammad . Their battle cry is the Arabic declaration that 'Allah hu Akbar'(Allah is the greatest!) . In the aftermath, White House spokesman Josh Earnest briefs the media on how his boss, President Obama, sees the slaughter in Paris . His diagnosis: A deplorable case of \"terrorism.\" Reporters notice a missing adjective . Has Earnest forgotten to mention something about the identity of the killers? No, not at all, Earnest says . He is simply trying to be accurate . He explains(and I paraphrase) that the Paris assassins were just folks who happened to commit mass murder against some journalists(every spokesman's fantasy-- I speak from personal experience) and then ,  stuck for an explanation, invoked Islam . The proof that this had nothing to do with the Religion of Peace is that it was \"roundly condemned by (unnamed) Muslim spiritual leaders . Not since the hapless Ron Ziegler assured the press that his boss, Richard Nixon, was not a crook, has a White House spokesman been reduced to invoking the,\"who-are-you-going- to- believe, me-or-your-lying-eyes,\" defense in quite such a pitiful way . The name \"Josh Earnest\" may not go down in history , but it is destined to become a \"Jeopardy\" answer : What presidential spokesman denied the existence of Islamic terrorism? Of course Earnest did this in a good cause-- keeping his job . And to be charitable, his boss probably has virtuous reasons for his see-no-evil approach , For one thing, he doesn't want to insult American Muslims , who are his supporters . For another, he may imagine that he is protecting them from Tea Party pogroms, an abiding, if entirely imaginary, liberal concern . It is likely that Obama also thinks that his discreet silence about who did what to whom in Paris is a boon the American fight for hearts and minds in the Middle East . If so , he is mistaken . Muslims from Nigeria to Chechnya know perfectly well that he is dissembling . Islam is the world's leading exporter of political and religious violence . Some Muslims regret it ; others see it as the fulfillment of a Koranic duty . Either way, they don't expect the victims to pretend that the infidel bodies lying dead at their desks in Paris just happened to drop dead . Alibiing for Islam makes Obama come off like Freddo (\"Moe didn't mean nothin' by slapping me around, Mikey, he's a good guy. He's sorry, right Moe?\"). Corleone . Like Freddo, Obama can be bullied into silence and appeased by insincere apologies . Just how insincere was evident a few days after the Paris massacre when the editors of Charlie Hebdo, in an act of startling courage, put another \"offensive\" cartoon of Mohammed on the cover of their magazine . Suddenly, it was back to yesterday in the House of Islam . Churches were torched by the faithful in Mali . Wild anti-Western rallies took place from Chechnya to Nigeria . The free-speech loving Imams and Ayatollahs of Josh Earnest's imagination incited worshippers with cries of blasphemy and holy war . The New York Times, house organ of the Obama administration, responded by not publishing the caricature because \"some readers\" (unspecified) might be offended . Such weakness is entirely transparent to the Muslim world--not only to the jihadis themselves, whose ranks are swelling with every attack but to their countless millions of admirers, apologists and silent supporters . It is also completely clear to Israel . For two years, Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have relentlessly and futilely tried to convince Jerusalem to withdraw from the West Bank and agree to the creation of a Palestinian state . The plan has been on life support for months ; it died--at least for the duration of the Obama administration-- in the kosher supermarket where four Jews were shot dead by a gunman inspired by the (non-denominational!) Islamic Caliphate of Iraq and Syria . The killer dedicated the job to the Palestinian people . The victims were buried in Jerusalem partly because their families feared their graves would be desecrated in France . The funerals coincided with the start of the election season in Israel . Prime Minister Netanyahu, running for a fourth term, is implacably opposed to making concessions to the Palestinian Authority , one of whose components, Hamas, is a branch of the M-word Brotherhood . Obama has made it clear that he would like Netanyahu to lose . This is a good thing for the Prime Minister . Even the left understands that there can be no deal backed by an American Godfather who is who is scared of Moe Greene .",

I was too young to remember anything from the night of December 2, 1984 , but , throughout the years, I have heard many stories from the people who were there and saw it happen . My sister would sometimes tell me things about that night , though we generally avoided bringing it up , as we knew that it would only hurt us to talk about it . After the disaster, some of our relatives, who had heard about it on the radio, came and took us to Lucknow, around 600km from Bhopal . We stayed with them for a few months , but they started treating us badly , as if we were a burden to them and their families , so it was our brother Sunil, another survivor from our family of 10 - aged 13 at the time of the disaster - who decided to bring us back to Bhopal . Subsequently, we were sent to an orphanage in Bhopal, called The SOS Children's Village . Sunil refused to live with us in the orphanage, and got involved with the anti-Carbide campaign . He created an organisation called Children Against Carbide . Most of the members of this organisation were children from the community we were from - Jay Prakash Nagar (JP Nagar), right across the road from the main Bhopal plant . I was happy with my life at the orphanage in Bhopal , I had almost everything: cricket bats, skates, football, good education etc . But ,  at the same time, I did not know anything about our parents . In middle school, we would have parent-teacher meetings at school ; my classmates had their parents next to them for the meeting , but I had no one next to me . It was around that time that I started asking my sister about our parents . It was then that my sister first told me about the Bhopal gas disaster and what had happened that night . Until then, I never fully understood that I was growing up in an orphanage and didn't really know the meaning of the word \"orphanage\" . My sister Mamta told me that there were four brothers and four sisters in our family . Our father was a carpenter , and I was the youngest in the family . We lost three sisters and two brothers along with our parents that night . I then asked her,\"How did we survive?\" She told me that she wrapped me in a blanket, and ran away along with our brother Sunil . When they were running, Sunil had to go to the bathroom, and fainted . The streets were so crowded as people were running and shouting , my sister was forced by the crowd, and couldn't wait any longer for my brother Sunil to come back . He succeeded in 2006 when he hung himself . So, now it is just Mamta and I - the only survivors from a family of 10 . Mamta lives in Lucknow with her husband and two children , and I live here in Bhopal on my own . She would often complain about severe headaches and eye problems . It has been almost 30 years now , and Bhopalis are still fighting for their basic rights . The disaster took so many lives, and is still killing people, as the abandoned factory continues poisoning our soil, water, and air . I started learning more about the disaster when I saw people of different ages chanting slogans in the streets of Bhopal when I was a child . In 2004, Greenpeace flew me to Paris to participate in a demonstration outside Dow's shareholders meeting . I got involved with the campaign in 2004 partly because of my brother's participation in the campaign . It was better to die fighting for our rights than succumb to depression over what had happened . I had a stroke in 2005, and started taking an aspirin everyday . I also had a pulmonary embolism in the US last year . Now I no longer take an aspirin , because now I have to take 7.5mg of warfarin, a blood thinner , which is also used as rat poison . In 2008, I was one of a number of Bhopal survivors in New Delhi who fasted for 21 days, only having water . We were asking then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up an empowered commission to look into the issues related to Bhopal . We also wanted clean water to be supplied to the people who were living in the affected communities and were forced to drink contaminated water . Everyone on this earth should feel this anger and frustration . It has been 30 years and justice continues to elude the people of Bhopal . We, the people of Bhopal, believe that the whole world has transformed into a Bhopal in a way : If you look around , you see multinational corporations being allowed to do business without accountability, poisoning the world and placing profits over people . If justice comes to Bhopal , then it would be justice for the whole world . It would set a precedent and ensure that in the future, corporations committing such crimes are brought to justice .",

            "input": "Is it not time to dismantle the CIA? It's not as if we weren't warned about the CIA . Some 50 years before the Senate Intelligence Committee issued its 500-page report on torture, former President Harry Truman published an opinion piece in the Washington Post asserting that the CIA was out of control and calling for it to be broken up . Truman's column appeared on December 22, 1963, a month to the day following US President John F Kennedy's assassination and 11 years after he himself moved out of the White House . Truman argued, as the president who authorised its establishment in 1947, that the CIA had strayed from the mission he had intended for it . He had favoured creation of the CIA so that a president would have one agency providing him with objective foreign intelligence, rather than having to rely upon the often conflicting information being served up by the Departments of State, Defense, and others who \"slanted to conform to established positions of a given department\" . Viewing intelligence gathering as its sole mission, Truman was disturbed \"by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment . It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government.\" He said he had \"never had any thought\" that the CIA would involve itself in \"cloak and dagger operations\" . But it had which \"has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas\" . It is clearly of some significance that Truman published his piece just one month after Kennedy's assassination . Although there is no evidence that Truman was suggesting CIA involvement in the assassination , it is impossible to believe that the late president's difficulties with the CIA were far from Truman's mind . As a former president who the Kennedy White House regularly briefed on foreign policy issues and decisions, Truman knew how the CIA essentially steamrolled Kennedy into the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (and other anti- Castro actions), leading Kennedy to tell a friend that he wanted\"to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds\" . Kennedy never had the chance to follow up on that idea but it was essentially what Truman suggested a month after Kennedy's death . Obviously, Truman's recommendation had no effect . In fact ,  the Washington establishment apparently took action to see that Truman's piece disappeared almost without a trace (easier in those pre-internet days) . According to former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, the Washington Post only published the piece in its morning edition, pulling it from view after that (a peculiar way to treat an opinion piece by a former president, especially on such a weighty issue) . McGovern also reports that former CIA Director Allen Dulles, who Kennedy fired after the Bay of Pigs debacle, actually flew down to Truman's home in Independence, Missouri to get the former president to retract . Although Dulles reported back to his friends that Truman had indeed recanted , he clearly never did . In fact ,  six months after publishing the column in the Post, Truman wrote to the managing editor of Look Magazine that he intended the CIA as an intelligence gathering agency only and not a place where\"strange activities\" would be launched . No doubt, the Bay of Pigs and Cuba, in general, were not the only examples of CIA interventions that disturbed Truman . In the years between the end of Truman's administration and his Washington Post column, the CIA had orchestrated the overthrow of governments in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Congo (1960), Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964) . Within a year following Truman's death, the CIA successfully brought down the Allende government in Chile (1973) . As for its activities since, its intelligence activities have clearly continued to be a low priority (it has gotten Iraq wrong from the start, culminating most recently in its failure to predict the rise of ISIL) while , what Truman called its \"cloak and dagger\" operations, have proliferated . According to historian William Blum, writing in Foreign Policy Journal, in the last 69 years, the CIA has (often in conjunction with the military) \"(1) attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments, most of which were democratically-elected, (2) attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries, (3) grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries, (4) dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries, (5) attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders.\" And now there are the horrific reports of torture and, equally appalling, the defense of CIA torture by former CIA driectors, other top CIA officials and, most enthusiastically, former Vice President Dick Cheney who famously told NBC five days after 9/11 that it was now time for US intelligence agencies to operate on the \"dark side\" . That is the context of the torture debate . As Truman understood, the CIA was dangerous and should be broken up or, in Kennedy's words, \"splinter[ed] into a thousand pieces and scatter[ed] to the winds\" . That was 50 years and nine presidents ago and since John F Kennedy, no president has challenged the CIA . Perhaps each of them have understood there are battles that not even a president could win .",

Clint Eastwood's \"American Sniper\" has struck a chord with the American people, and did so by tapping into the deepest civic values we have as Americans - duty, honor, fidelity, courage, love for country...and a love for others . However , no war movie can live on the big screen without a spew of liberal backlash , and this film is no different . Criticism has come quickly from Michael Moore, Seth Rogen, former Vermont Gov  Howard Dean and other Hollywood leftists . Thankfully, some things speak louder than cowardly tweets -- like the more than $200 million in ticket sales the movie has raked in just one week . In fact ,  the new war film featuring Bradley Cooper as well-known Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle, is on pace to become the top-grossing war film of all time . As much as the left would like you to believe it , Chris Kyle was not a bloodthirsty warmonger ; he was a noble warrior who fought to defend his fellow troops, watched over the lives of his brothers, and advanced the cause of (eventual) peace . This is where the true success of \"American Sniper\" comes to light . The film is not a movie about the Iraq war, or whether we won or lost; or even whether our motivations were justified . Instead ,  it's a story about a man and the many trials of war, including coming home from it . In the words of my good friend and former Army Ranger, Sean Parnell,\"[American Sniper] isn't a pro-war film. It's a pro-warrior film.\" That's the key . The movie is a testament to the warrior - to the man in the arena . Everyone criticizing the film is on the sidelines hurling insults . Chris was in the arena, fighting for us in a dangerous and complicated war . Nonetheless ,  outspoken liberals will continue to cast judgment, saying that they support the warrior but not the war . But they contradict themselves even on that point . The left sees warriors--men like Chris Kyle--as bloodthirsty and ignorant Americans from fly-over country who cling to God and guns in blind support of our military . They dislike both the warandthe warrior . Nothing could be further from the truth . In reality, middle-America is full of hard working people of faith and fidelity who love their nation and believe in celebrating someone like Chris Kyle . These are people who feel like they're already taxed enough, that the government is over-bearing in their lives, that religion has been stripped from every aspect of civil society, and that the president is misguided in his gutting of their military . They are, in a word, patriots . Despite their frustrations with leftists, middle America is the beating heart of our nation and remains the first in line to selflessly strap on their boots and defend the very freedoms that people like Michael Moore use to criticize them . It's awfully easy for progressives to cast criticism down from their isolated ivory towers , but next time they consider demeaning the warriors protecting them afar, as Chris Kyle once did, they may want to consider who protects those towers and keeps them from tumbling . They're not only the folks who see this movie , but more often than not, they're the kind of people depicted in these movies . They're the kind of people who embody\"citizenship,\" and the very idea of living and fighting for something bigger than oneself . Chris Kyle understood that . Today's servicemen and women understand that . And that's why millions of people are seeing this movie . They want to celebrate and believe in America again, if only for two short hours in a crowded dark theater .",

You see it everywhere this time of year: \"Peace on Earth, Good Will to All People.\" Meanwhile, according to the British newspaper The Independent, only eleven countries on earth are free from violent conflict . There are more than twenty- five full-on wars happening right now and 169 violent militia and rebel conflicts . Peace on Earth -- when will it happen? It's time to adopt an Alcoholics Anonymous approach to world peace . According to scientists, for as long as there have been intoxicants, a portion of human beings has struggled with addiction . For millennia, various disciplines including medicine, psychiatry and religion attempted, unsuccessfully, to help people suffering from an addiction to booze . All of the approaches stemmed from the same common approach : Let's resolve your problems so you'll stop drinking . Alcoholics Anonymous reversed this . A.A  has succeeded because it was the first to say,\"Stop drinking FIRST and then we'll work on your problems.\" Thanks to this subtle shift, countless jobs, marriages, and even lives have been saved . Heretofore, humanity's approach to peace has been like outdated approaches to alcoholism . Attempts at peace have centered on,\"Let's resolve our differences so we can stop killing each other.\" This has only lead to the discovery of more differences and more killing . It's time we followed the example of recovery programs such as A.A  and resolve to, FIRST, stop killing each other and then we can work on our differences . War is used as a tool of international policy because people accept it . All we have to do is change our minds-- to cease to believe that war is an acceptable necessary evil and to begin to believe that no disagreement is worth killing each other's children . Countries have been trying to resolve their differences so that there will no longer be war . We need to declare peace first and then spend eternity working out our differences . The option of war is simply removed from the table . This is why I am declaring enduring world peace beginning September 21, 2056 . Seriously . September 21st is the United Nations World Day of Peace -- so there is already momentum there . We just need to turn those national celebrations into a countdown to world peace . 2056 is far enough in the future that it gives us time for enough people to make the requisite shift in belief such that peace will, indeed, reign on planet Earth . Who am I to make such a proclamation? I'm just a writer and an ordained minister and there are crazy preachers who, every decade or so, declare the end of the world is coming on this or that date . So why can't I say when world peace will begin? Incidentally, this is not a new idea . The Kellogg Briand Pact of 1927, sponsored by the United States and signed by 62 countries declared that war may not be used to resolve \"disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise.\" Every major religion shares a common belief in the sanctity of human life and yet war has endured . If enough people believe-- just believe , that as of September 21, 2056 war will end on planet earth-- it must happen! If eleven, only eleven out of 196 countries are at peace , it still means that right now, in at least eleven countries there is peace . We simply need to build on this over the next forty-two years . This year, when you say,\"Peace on Earth,\" give peace a beginning date .",

David Cameron, for example - I think he's his friend . He'd definitely say he was Michael Gove's friend but then , politicians being what they are, the fact that he'd say it doesn't enormously increase the statistical chances of its being true . Anyway , they're certainly political allies - or at least were, before Gove made his ill-judged remark about the \"preposterous\" number of the prime minister's coterie who went to Eton , which ironically led Cameron to lose faith in about the only one who didn't, Gove himself . \"That's what you get,\" the PM must have muttered to himself,\"for trusting oiks.\" Since then Gove's slide down the greasy pole could hardly have been less dignified if he'd been wearing nipple tassels . Which, for all we know, he was . Like a former deputy headmaster who's been busted down to head prefect , Gove not only has to remain loyal to a government that has scorned him but, as chief whip, he must also enforce loyalty in others . But I didn't feel sorry for him until last week when I read that his mobile phone had gone off during a cabinet meeting . This is obviously bad form : for security reasons, you're not even supposed to bring phones into those gatherings . To make matters worse his ringtone is, according to someone who was there:\"Jazz FM-style comedown music after a heavy night out\" . I'm not entirely sure what that means , but it's clearly some sort of tune . I'm going to imagine it as the theme from Bod . So in the middle of some serious conversation about the Charlie Hebdo shootings or the economy or the NHS, while Vince Cable is expressing some \"serious concerns\" and everyone else is trying to make drooping eyelids look like they're concentrating hard , suddenly it's \"Diddle-it-deduh-dede-duh-duh!\" and Gove is jumping and wriggling like George Osborne's Tasered him again . Gove's seated twist having gone on \"for quite a while\", the PM intervened with what one witness described as \"a public bollocking\" . Even if Cameron could summon no compassion for his friend , I can . I sympathise with Michael Gove here, as a point of principle . I also sympathise with those people in West End theatres who are hit by a volley of rage and sarcasm from some knight of the stage when Nokia Tune has crashed in on his soliloquy . I sympathise whenever it happens at meetings, weddings, carol services or when someone's tearfully coming out . I sympathise because one day it will happen to me . However careful I am with my phone- and, as a slightly obsessive person, I'm pretty careful- there are times when I take it out, utterly convinced that it's been switched off for hours, and find five bars beaming back from my hand, as incriminating as a gory dagger . Most of the time, I check it every 30 seconds . But sometimes I just don't . My fastidious self-image deceives me into carelessness . At some point, I'm going to come a cropper . And when that shaming moment comes , as I fumble in my trousers by the heat of a hundred stares , I want to be surrounded by people who accept that this could happen to anyone, and might believe that this is an issue about which I'm at least averagely diligent . That's not how it'll be, though . Our attitudes to accidental phone rings are stuck in the 80s . Even though the mobile has long since ceased to be a cutting-edge gadget possessed only by the high-earning early-adopting few , when one goes off inappropriately, we still visualise a shameless yuppie in red braces, Aston Martin double-parked outside, closing deals - an offensive symbol of profligate and faddish modernity . This is hopelessly out of step with what these machines now mean to us . Research just published by a team at the University of Missouri shows that, when a sample of 40 people were temporarily deprived of their iPhones, their heart rate and blood pressure rose, and their ability to perform tasks suffered . Our mobiles, the paper suggests, are now \"an extension of our physical selves, an umbilical cord, anchoring the information society's digital infrastructure to our very bodies\" . We hate to be parted from them and we don't much like turning them off . Many will lament this , but it's not altogether bad . Our phones reassure us because they make us feel connected  - because if your mobile is turned on, in range and not ringing , it probably means that no work crisis has developed and no disaster has befallen a close friend or loved one . It's a constant everyone-in-your-life-is-more-or-less-OK monitor . Maybe we should learn to live without such reassurance , but it doesn't reflect entirely badly on us that we're comforted by it . People often criticise one another for talking or texting on their phones in preference to live interaction . \"We met for a coffee but she spent the whole time on the phone!\" \"We were having lunch and his mobile rang- and he actually answered it!\" Such critics forget that, in the heyday of the landline, a ringing telephone - the phone in the hall - was always answered . The notion of call screening is entirely modern . It never used to be rude to answer - it was rude not to . The onus of politeness, in those days, was on the caller . Except in an emergency, you didn't telephone someone at a mealtime, during their favourite television programme or after 10 o'clock . When you thought someone might not want to be disturbed, you didn't disturb them unless you had to . It's the passing of that etiquette, rather than the prevalence of mobile phones, that I think is a shame . Of course ,  in the age of the mobile, it's impossible to know whether the person you're calling will find it convenient to chat . You can't know if they're eating or in the cinema or reading the traffic news . So how about this : only call a mobile if you really need to . If you just want a chat, call a landline , and not during meals . So that , if \"I Will Survive\" starts blaring from your Android during an aunt's funeral , it's not you who's been rude .

It wasn't that I hadn't learned my wrongs from rights, more that they didn't matter to the group of kids I then found myself around . Grades or sporting prowess accounted for nothing .

He was not just an incredibly violent man, but apparently belonged to a group of them . This made him even more attractive . Mal was a member of a then-notorious neo-Nazi organisation with a track record of serious criminal activity . He regularly turned up at whatever suburban park or abandoned house we found ourselves in as we sought to consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes . I didn't find it at all odd that a man pushing 30 was interested in hanging out with a bunch of delinquent teens . The more drunk we became, the more compelling his violent stories seemed . One night Mal invited me to tag along to one of the group's semi-regular gatherings . As I listened to one of the speakers rally his audience against the \"foreign invaders\" , I was immediately hooked . It was not I that had problems, I was told, it was people of another skin colour . The confusion that had been my constant companion, now viewed through this extremist lens, had suddenly become both figuratively and literally black and white . No longer was I to blame for anything . I didn't need to look at my part in my own downward spiral, as teachers, family members and police kept telling me . All life's troubles, it seemed, were the doing of non-whites . It was a relief to no longer feel responsible for my own - and others' - suffering, but better than that, I was now being called upon to be a vital part of \"the solution\" . It is, I imagine, the same sentiment a potential jihadist feels when he or she foolishly believes that they're being righteously called upon to fight for the creation of an Islamic state , as if that might fix what are largely personal troubles . I became part of a group that would drive around in the leader's ageing hatchback, plastering racist posters on walls and telegraph poles calling for action against the \"Asian invasion\" . Too dysfunctional to stage any coordinated sort of attack, our race war consisted of nothing more than starting fights with non-whites who were minding their own business . Since we were always heavily intoxicated, more often than not our victims survived the attacks in far better shape than we did . Unlike today , when a disenfranchised youth has a raft of violent ideologies to be swept up in , it was then my pure fortune that my only real option for extremist activity was this poorly led group . Ongoing action by Asio and the now-defunct special branch of the NSW police and, mostly, the self-implosion of key individuals in the group, meant that by the time I joined it was only a shadow of its former strength . Thanks to strong family support together with professional help, I was able to leave the group and its racist ideology well behind . I was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a case of long-term bullying at school . While that has helped me understand what drove me to this group , it is clear that all the factors that leave a young person susceptible to extremist ideology- poverty, lack of education, inadequate mental health support services and general social exclusion - still widely exist across western nations . I cringe when I hear our political leadership deliver yet another speech extolling a commitment to fighting extremism, yet in almost the time it takes to draw their next breath, go on to announce cuts to community services groups, the kind of organisations whose roles are vital in addressing the risk factors that leave one vulnerable to extremism . It's not that Orwell was completely off the mark when he said\"people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf\" . It is just that by the time the men with guns are needed, the radicalisation process has already happened . This is a process that cannot be stopped by sending troops to regions where most locals couldn't even spell \"Australia\", let alone have the capacity or even the desire to attack us . The clear and present danger today, as events from Oklahoma City through most recently to Paris have shown, is that the biggest threats are of the home-grown variety . The real frontline in the war on terror is to be found in our education and mental health services . Until such institutions are resourced as freely as our military is , then extremists will be here to stay .",

            "input": "If je ne suis pas Charlie, am I a bad person? Nuance gets lost in groupthink. In the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris last week, many people in France and elsewhere have declared, Je suis Charlie (\"I am Charlie\") after heavily armed gunmen broke into the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French magazine, and killed eight staff members, two police officers, a building maintenance worker and wounded several others . On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people including a number of world leaders such as Angela Merkel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and David Cameron gathered in Paris for a unity rally, to stand in mourning, in defiance . There were cries of Je suis Charlie, Je suis Ahmed(I am Ahmed, the Muslim police officer who lost his life in the attack), Je suis juif(I am a Jew) . These declarations were a display of solidarity with those who lost their lives and those who survived . They allowed people to try and place themselves in the lives of others by using the power of language . We have seen this kind of remembrance before in the face of tragedy : I am Troy Davis ; I am Mike Brown ; I am Eric Garner ; I am Renisha McBride . But we are none of these people . We can and do empathize with the plights of the dead, the survivors and their loved ones . We can and do empathize with how fragile we all are, and with how we cannot be ruled by terror, but why the rhetorical urge to take the place of the fallen? What does it bring them? I, too, have ached since hearing the news of what happened in Paris but je ne suis pas Charlie et je ne suis pas Ahmed et je ne suis pas juif . There are times when silence equals consent, but is the loss of someone else's life really such an instance? Is it reasonable to assume that if je ne suis pas Charlie, I tacitly endorse terrorism? I believe in the freedom of expression, unequivocally - though , as I have written before , I wish more people would understand that freedom of expression is not freedom from consequence . I find some of the work of Charlie Hebdo distasteful , because there is a preponderance of bigotry of all kinds in many of their cartoons' sentiments . Still ,  my distaste should not dictate the work the magazine produces or anything else . The cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo - and writers and artists everywhere - should be able to express themselves and challenge authority without being murdered . Murder is not an acceptable consequence for anything . Yet it is also an exercise of freedom of expression to express offense at the way satire like Charlie Hebdo's characterizes something you hold dear - like your faith, your personhood, your gender, your sexuality, your race or ethnicity . Demands for solidarity can quickly turn into demands for groupthink , making it difficult to express nuance . It puts the terms of our understanding of the situation in black and white - you are either with us or against us - instead of allowing people to mourn and be angry while also being sympathetic to complexities that are being overlooked . It has been disheartening to see calls for the Muslim community to denounce terrorism . It has been disheartening to see journalists highlighting the stories of \"good\" Muslims , as if goodness is the exception to the rule of an entire people . We will continue to see discussions of satire, the freedom of expression and its limits . We will see speculations as to how such a tragedy can be avoided because it is easier to speculate than it is to accept that we cannot prevent terrorism . We cannot sway extremists with rational thought or with our ideas of right and wrong . Life moves quickly but , sometimes, consideration does not . And yet ,  we insist that people provide an immediate response, or immediate agreement, a universal, immediate me-too  - as though we don't want people to pause at all, to consider what they are weighing in on . We don't want to complicate our sorrow or outrage when it is easier to experience these emotions in their simplest, purest states . The older(and hopefully wiser) I get, the more I want to pause . I want to take the time to think through how I feel and why I feel . I don't want to feign expertise on matters I know nothing about for the purpose of offering someone else my immediate reaction for their consumption . The demand for response from all of us through the means available to us, most often our social networks, rises in part because we can feel so impotent in our day-to-day lives . We are people with jobs and families and our quotidian concerns . It is easy to feel impotent in the face of terrorism in Paris or hundreds of girls being kidnapped in Nigeria or a bombing at an NAACP building in Colorado or an unarmed black man being killed by a police officer . Within our social networks, we can feel less alone . We can feel less impotent . We can make these gestures of solidarity . Je suis Charlie . We can change our avatars . We can share our anger, our fear, or devastation without having to face that we may not be able to do much more . But we still feel impotent and we still feel inadequate . When we see people not participating in our expressions of solidarity-- not showing their awareness of their own impotence-- we see something we can possibly change . That is why we demand allegiance .",

            "input": "Joan Didion as the new face of Celine? That's so smart. In dark days, the heart cleaves disproportionately to Lilliputian scraps of good news and so it was that as events played out in Paris last week, I kept thinking of the writer Joan Didion, the star of Celine's latest ad campaign, tiny in black, her porcelain face half obscured by sunglasses as big and as inky as the dinner plates in the kind of restaurants frequented by Patrick Bateman in American Psycho . Oh, the brilliance of Didion! I like to think of myself as wholly resistant to the wicked wiles of big fashion , but this campaign seemed somehow to have got through , and I was all aflutter . What, I wondered, was the provenance of the socking great pendant that hung about her neck in Juergen Teller's photograph? Was it by Celine or was it, as they say, model's own? Could I find something similar on eBay? All day long, between work and news bulletins, I restlessly Googled various combinations of the words \"buy\", \"vintage\", \"bronze\", \"large\" and \"locket\" . The coverage of the Paris fashion house's decision to make the author of Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album and The Year of Magical Thinking its new face has focused mostly on her age . Didion is 80 ; when she began her career as a writer at American Vogue in the late 50s, the personnel director of the magazine's owner, Conde Nast, would from time to time stop her in the hall and ask her when she had last called her mother . Apparently, we should celebrate Teller's photograph of her as a particularly exalted example of fashion's increased willingness to embrace models with wrinkles, liver spots and histories that trail all the way back to the days when women still wore white gloves and little hats to work . At last, the thinking goes, fashion has realised that beauty may also come with silver hair . What? You don't buy that? Well, then . Think of it this way . At least it seems finally to have grasped that women don't simply give up shopping the moment they turn 50 . But it's not Didion's age that interests me . It's her status as a writer and thinker . By choosing her- acclaimed and bestselling, but also trenchant, highly mannered and somewhat complicated - Celine's creative director, Phoebe Philo, is sending out quite a bracing message , even if the semaphore in which it's written will, alas, be largely illegible to those who know nothing of Didion . There' s something going on beyond the cunning commercial appeal to the kind of conflicted consumer who values the inner life as much as the outer  - I mean the kind of woman whose \"buttery\" leather tote must be big enough to contain at least one hardback if it is not to make her feel guilty for the rest of her life . Isn't this campaign also in the business of suggesting that to be clever and a touch difficult(Didion is nothing if not unpredictable) is to be timelessly beautiful? That this is, in fact, a state to which women might like to aspire? Oh, Phoebe! If only I could afford your gorgeous, minimalist gear , I would dash out and buy something right now just to say thank you . And yet how often have I chickened out? How often do I try, even now, to wear pretty clothes, fun clothes, to embrace colour and print and embroidery? To toddle along in shoes in which I cannot run or even, if I'm honest, walk? Like most professional women who are neither beautiful nor willing to play dumb all of the time, I fear being thought ugly or uncompromising or seeming as if I have not made an effort . I fear, if you will, being seen to be picking a fight, whether by the way I speak or the way I dress . I guess you could say that I wear the swishy frock and high heels the better that I might be allowed, sometimes, to speak my mind . I adore the way that Didion, half child and half sphinx, thinner than a cigarette, looks . But she is not, and never has been, classically beautiful . Nor is she willing to play the fool . She is discreet, but never decorous ; she is fierce, preternaturally observant and, sometimes, a little self-obsessed . And her clothes - unfussy, elegant, practical, a touch forbidding - reflect this . What Teller's photograph says to me is: approach with caution; subject may bite . I love the continuity in this, the wholeness, the confidence in the way that the clothes are an extension of the personality - and I salute Phoebe Philo for recognising it, for extolling it to the world as worthy of admiration, as a thing to be replicated by those women who have the pluck, if not exactly the hard cash .",

Sadly, there is little time for reflection or celebration . More pressing are the competing demands and challenges fuelled by an upsurge in conflict, disease and human suffering . These compel the international community to step up and provide the leadership needed to tackle them . Ebola continues to plague west Africa . For some of the affected countries, struggling to overcome the effects of bitter civil war, the outbreak has been a major setback for development . We are beginning to see some improvements . During my visit to the region in December, I was deeply moved by the efforts of local Ebola responders and health workers from across Africa and the world . But rebuilding shattered lives and economies will require significantly more resources and long-term commitment . As conflicts raged and extremism rose , 2014 pushed the UN's humanitarian, peacekeeping and diplomatic efforts to the limit . More than 100 million people needed assistance . An unprecedented number of UN troops and police are deployed in highly volatile security environments . The elimination of Syria's chemical weapons programme was a major achievement , but the conflict continues to inflict immense suffering and will soon enter its fifth year . As bitter winter conditions set in , millions of refugees are in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance . The presence of thousands of foreign terrorist fighters there and in Iraq has added a further volatile dimension . Groups responsible for atrocities have capitalised on a legacy of atrocious governance towards disenfranchised populations . Our response to brutality and extremism cannot be limited to military action, important as it is . We must address the conditions that give rise to such poison in the first place . In the same vein, those conducting military actions against terrorists must be sure that such efforts fully observe human rights . As we have seen time and again , failure to do so can end up serving as a recruiting agent for terrorists . Elsewhere, the recent appalling terrorist attacks in Paris show how vulnerable any society can be . Countries in Europe and elsewhere have witnessed a deeply worrying escalation of tensions between communities and within societies . Giving in to hatred and sowing division only guarantees a spiral of violence- precisely what terrorists seek . We must not fall into that trap . Addressing discord in a manner that solves, rather than multiplies, the problem may be the greatest test our human family faces in the 21st century . There is a long list of other hot-spots- stretching from Nigeria to Yemen, from the rise in fighting in Darfur to the transition in Afghanistan . Conflict in Ukraine has endangered security and stability in Europe, and reanimated the ghosts of the cold war . Israelis and Palestinians must ease the explosive situation in Gaza and the West Bank, and move away from confrontation and towards a negotiated settlement . But in a year marked by turmoil, UN member states have also proposed an initial draft set of sustainable development goals that will guide anti- poverty efforts for the next generation . Further negotiations will begin this month and culminate at a special summit in New York in September with the adoption of a development agenda that can help tackle inequality, empower women and girls, and promote shared prosperity . Climate action took on significant momentum with major announcements by the EU, the US and China, and a successful climate conference in Lima, Peru , that kept complex negotiations on track . We must aim high: for the adoption of an ambitious and universal agreement in Paris in December to keep the rise in global temperatures below the dangerous threshold of 2C . Ours is the first generation that can end poverty, and the last that can take steps to avoid the worst impacts of climate change . In this 70th anniversary year in which we renew our commitment to the goals and principles of the UN charter, the international community must rise to the moment .",

            "input": "Last minute Christmas shopping: Five things to avoid. This weekend millions of Americans will take to the mall to get last-minute gifts for their loved ones . They will pour through the already-picked-over selections to try and find \"the gift.\" For those of you who are forced into the mall this weekend : I'm sorry . Here are five things to avoid as we enter the final shopping days before Christmas . 1 \\. Believe the best bargains are found if you wait until the last minute . While it's true , retailers are starting their after-Christmas sales earlier than ever - just as the Christmas shopping season starts before you get to Thanksgiving dessert - seasoned shoppers know(1) value and(2) bargain do not mean the same thing . We all know just because something is cheap doesn't mean it's \"a bargain\" or a \"value.\" It's only a bargain if it is truly something you want or need, and are able to get it at a deep discount . Often last minute shoppers don't know what they want . For those shopping this weekend you will have to settle for what circumstances present , which in many cases will be cheap materials, but not a bargains . The value is the ratio of quality (or quantity) to price . Low quality at a low price is no value , especially when compared to high quality at a low price . Values tend go early in the holiday shopping season . Cheap stays on the shelf until it's all that's left . 2 . Believe there is still money to spend in your budget this month . Last minute shopping, particularly for December, means buying during the back half of the month . That's typically when most income for the month is already committed , and any incremental spending means \"borrowing against the future.\" It's better to buy early - and spread the purchasing over time - so you can more easily absorb the expense . Nobody likes that \"January surprise.\" And for new last- minute shoppers, that surprise can be surprisingly BIG! 3 . Believe you can still find \"just the right gift for Uncle George.\" Waiting until the last minute to shop means having to make compromises . Time and selection are your two greatest \"friends\" when you shop early . But for last minute shoppers they become your two greatest nightmares : you're pressed for time and all the best colors, sizes and values, are gone . Don't put yourself under a lot of pressure to find that perfect gift . At this stage in the game, a gift will do . 4 . Believe you still need \"just one more\" gift . We should all take a lesson out of Santa's playbook: 1. Make a list. 2. Check it twice . Too often last minute shopping isn't just an indication you've waited to the bitter end to buy those needed gifts . It also means you've waited too long to plan that shopping . And when that happens you're never quite sure if you have all the gifts you need (it seems keeping track of what you've bought is just as hard as planning what to buy in advance!) . So you keep buying just one more gift... just to make sure you've covered all your bases . By the way, that's when shoppers are especially susceptible to impulse buying . An attention-arresting display will attract last minute shoppers like honey attracts flies! 5 . Believe that the shopper has the advantage . While it is true that the Saturday before Christmas is still one of the busiest shopping days of the year , the advantage has swung back in favor of the retailer . With fewer hours to shop until Santa fills his sack, the retailer has the upper hand , especially if they've had a strong Q4 . For some, shopping the weekend before Christmas can bring the ultimate sense of that holiday experience . For those who enjoy shopping as a pastime, it's one of the best times to be in the mall , but for those folks who need to fulfill a shopping list, it can be one of the worst . The early bird still does get the worm . And the late bird gets ... the opportunity to pick over the dregs with a lot of other \"late birds.\" With the brief time remaining before Christmas, use it to \"shop for fun\" not for necessity . It will truly help keep you in the Christmas spirit .",

            "input": "Lebanon has just done the unthinkable. Lebanon has just done the apparently unthinkable and placed visa control on the entry of Syrians into the country . Before, the situation was effectively a free flow that had resulted in Syrians, mostly refugees, amounting today to 20 percent of the population on Lebanese soil . Imagine 12 million French in the UK today . The Lebanese government has assured international agencies that it will still permit and facilitate humanitarian cases , but the step is a telling one . The real story behind this is the annihilation of borders from Baghdad to Beirut . ISIL is one stark and ugly manifestation of that reality but so are the refugees, a tragic event that has also affected Turkey and Jordan . This zone that once facilitated trade is now closer to scenes from Road Warrior - or the sad march of the displaced . The disintegration of Sykes Picot has blurred nation-states as cross border allegiances fight it out on a series of fronts and through a myriad of forces from Jubhat al-Nusra, Shia militias, Peshmergas, to the Lebanese Armed forces to the now infamous ISIL . Borders don't seem to mean much in this Middle East , if they ever did . The refugees are the terrible consequence and victims of these conflicts that plague this area . The best response to them is not visas but a proper joint response by the Lebanese government assisted by international insititutions . The reality however is that the former is incapable , and the latter insufficiently funded to deal with such a massive influx . As a result, many refugees are living in terrible conditions . The other harsh reality is that the Lebanese government has said that this will not affect Syrian \"visitors\" to Lebanon . There are six classes of visitors in the new system and the Syrian middle class and rich are unlikley to be affected . Walid Jumblatt stated that his country should differentiate between \"refugees who are fleeing death and destruction in Syria after they lost their homes,\" and those who intend to be politically active , but the reality is that the poorest will be most affected . Indeed ,  it's a large question mark whether Lebanon has the capacity to even implement the measure it has just taken . The Syrian presence in Lebanon is so pervasive it may well be impossible to manage the situation, except to manage some future inflow . Furthermore ,  the idea of Lebanon, a country barely treading water, being able to manage such a problem is unrealistic . Only a regional and international effort of significance can manage such a scale , and regional powers are busy carving their fiefdoms and creating the very problem rather than solving it . The plight of the refugees is key but it is also important to perceive this event from the perspective of the host country; a small nation with very poor governance and infrastructure in the midst of regional turmoil . In a way, this is Lebanon's very small response to the erosion of Sykes Picot . Syrians are indeed everywhere in Lebanon . In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits . Flights from Beirut to Europe are one-third to half full of Syrians . Indeed ,  given this massive presence and Lebanon's already poor infrastructure and socio-economic state, it is an achievement that the Syrian crisis has not led to further deterioration in the country . The relations in Lebanon between the two peoples, despite some racism and ugly incidents, could have been far worse . Until now, Lebanese hosting of the refugees is characterised by neither generosity nor enmity, but by a passive acceptance of fate . This is partially driven by the fact that Syrians are culturally and linguistically akin , and some sectors of the Lebanese economy, e.g  construction, remain highly dependent on Syrian workers . How this will square with the new visa rules is unknown . More importantly, this step can be seen as part of a series of recent indirect actions that attempt to strengthen the Lebanese state, or at least make the pretense of doing so . Minister of Health Abu Faour has been on an intense and mediatic campaign to clean up the food industry in Lebanon, cracking down restaurants, slaughterhouses, and airport storage sites . Despite complaints, this clean up, if it lasts, is a welcome step for Lebanese ; it is national, potentially affects everyone positively, and is an act of government . Second ,  in an echo of the Nahr el-Bared campaign, the Lebanese army is taking responsibility in the Northern Bekaa and Hermel areas against the radical groups who are effectively fighting the Syrian war on Lebanese soil . Pride in the Lebanese army is rising . There are also rumours that the Lebanese government will also take on the murderous Indie-500 speeders on Lebanse highways in the spring . If this does occur in addition to bold step of visas for Syrians , a move that would have been unheard of when Lebanon was effectively a vassal state of Damascus, then indeed Lebanon could see the bare beginnings of emerging out of chaos through these small attempts . The political realities in Lebanon are of course more complicated and illusory than this . Many only see in all of the above feeble attempts to deflect from the reality of a total political vaccuum . Indeed , the Lebanese visa step is obviously not humanitarian , it is a self- interested attempt to stem the tide, put a thumb in the dyke, and avoid the emergent chaos in the Middle East . It would be better if the Lebanese had the magnamity, or much more importantly, the capacity , to continue simply receiving all Syrians , but they are barely running their own country . Compassion requires an orderly method and capacities in order to be effectively pursued , i.e the Lebanese need a functioning state of their own to handle such a crisis properly . Indeed ,  Lebanon has mostly escaped the wars next door not out of wisdom or discipline, or any energetic international diplomacy, but because the memories of that conflict are still vivid in the minds of Lebanese adults . No one will go to war because they remember what war costs , and because they know how little they derived from the devastation . The result of 15 years of fighting was that the state was further weakened in favour of sectarianism, cronyism and corruption , while the Lebanese kept on doing what they do best, make money and enjoy life, living for today and certainly not tomorrow . Meanwhile, social and environmental erosion make the country less and less livable by the day . The recent steps however, triggered by political challenges and health risks, signal some early and feeble attempts at a return of the state, or at the very least preserving the semblance of the old order, the shadow of a nation-state, amidst the dark fluidity and chaos surging from there to Kurdistan . It took the Lebanese 40 years and external pressures to begin to think about getting their house in order , if that is indeed what is happening today . Hopefully, it won't take their neighbours that long to start to address the necessary basics of life .",

            "input": "Can you stop using these three labels in 2015: 'Poor people,' 'date rape' and 'victim'. Can you banish the labels \"date rape,\" \"victims\" and \"poor people\" from your vocabulary in 2015? Labels can diminish and demean or to uplift and affirm people . 2015 will be a year of hope and dignity by redefining or banishing these toxic and harmful labels . In their place a more generous, positive and compassionate country will emerge . Here's why a deeper look at these three labels :. Date Rape . This is the most commonly talked about fear on college campuses across the country . 2014 was filled with stories of sexual abuse from the ranks of the NFL and their spouses to the iconic Bill Cosby . On college campuses date rape involves issues of consent and sobriety; of women who feel that they don't have the ability to consent or not; of alcohol and drugs like \"roofies\" used as excuses and no specific profile of the typical rapist . The words date and rape should never be accepted as co-joined words . My friend Tony Porter of A Call to Men says that gender based violence will only end when men address it and reassess what it means to be a man . He is correct . To be on a date is to enter into an exploration of romance, companionship and possibly love . It is about exploring the possibilities of human togetherness and relationship . Rape is a criminal and violent exercise of abuse and power . To disassociate these two words - rape and date - is to redefine the expectation of healthy and also criminal behavior . You can redefine the term date rape by celebrating the possibilities of healthy dating and mincing no words about the criminality of rape . Engaging young men in the cause of stopping gender based violence will bring with it lasting impact on healthy relationships . Victims . The accusers of sexual violence are commonly called victims . They are typically the victims of aggressive non-consensual sex . But to call them victims is to deny their courage and strength . The supermodel Janice Dickinson recently said that she is not an accuser . She explained this by saying that she is speaking her truth about what Bill Cosby did to her decades ago . How strong do you have to be to speak out against those who are iconic figures or heroes- whether clergy, Cosby or NFL players? To speak your truth against power typically results from years if not decades of inner work along with courage that reveals you have come to love yourself enough to not be intimidated by the powerful iconic figures who have committed sexual abuse . People like Dickinson are empowered, courageous victims . They give hope to others including the many men who feel that their manhood will be compromised if they speak out against their male sexual abusers . Empowered victims like Dickinson move us quickly from just feeling sorry to feeling admiration for their courageous empowerment . What happened to them is criminal and to label them as just victims demeans their courage . Empowered victims elevate their status and shine a bright spotlight on their heinous sexual aggressor . Poor People . A pervasive new classism in the United States has emerged according to columnist David Brooks of the New York Times . He posits that the meritocratic class view themselves as the respectable ones who have the ability to choose their own destiny . They view the poor as lazy, disorganized, violent and scary . In this view the poor are not proper human beings . It's a dangerous construct that dehumanizes vast segments of our community . I've spent a lifetime working with and knowing people who are poor . Most work hard and often at several jobs ; like other human beings they yearn for the best for their children and families and have aspirations to live beyond poverty . If the organization of the lives of those who are poor is different from that of the meritocratic class it is because of genetic roulette and the systems that often work to trap people in the mire of less opportunity . Brooks suggests that those who label the poor in this way live in a world that keeps them from knowing poor people . The label begins to be redefined when you take time to know those who are different from you . It is up to you to make change in the New Year by not accepting these labels and then redefining them . You will be part of creating a more compassionate, generous and positive landscape .",

            "input": "Let the Iraqi Army have its day. On January 6, Iraq will hold its annual Army Day parade in Baghdad . The ceremony evokes mixed feelings amongst Iraqis : after all ,  the parade marches under massive crossed swords wielded by giant bronze hands modelled on those of Saddam Hussein himself . For the Kurds it is an ominous ritual, a leftover from an era when Baghdad's military power far outstripped that of the Kurds and when Iraqi state power was used ruthlessly against northern rebellions . The stronger the Iraqi army gets, the Kurds reckon, the more chance it will be used against Kurdistan again . Iraq's Sunnis were the leading force within the Iraqi army since its foundation on January 6, 1921 . In general ,  the Sunnis fondly remember the pre-2003 army as a national institution of unrivalled prestige but view today's Iraqi army as a weak shadow of its former self, dominated by Shia officers . The views of Iraq's Shia community may be more complex . Before 2003, the Iraqi military was regularly used as a tool of oppression against the Iraqi Shia , yet many older Shia also remember the army as a symbol of modernity and Arab nationalist pride . With a Shia-led government in Baghdad, young Shia were beginning to recognise the army as a friendly institution . The collapse of Iraqi army divisions in northern and western Iraq in June 2014 dented the army's reputation, with recent victories being credited to the predominately-Shia popular mobilisation militias (al-Hashd al-Shaabi) or else the tiny cadre of special forces - the so-called Golden Division . This is a critical year for the Iraqi army , which is in danger of losing its status as the nation's premier armed force . In 2009, when the US-led\"train and equip\" effort reached its zenith, the Iraqi army fielded 55 combat brigades with approximately 210,000 troops . The Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MoI) fielded around 30 smaller brigades, totaling around 120,000 troops . Today the Iraqi army fields 40 weak brigades with a total combat strength of around 48,000 troops . In contrast ,  the MoI survived the summer comparatively well and now fields 24 brigades, totaling around 36,000 troops . The gap has narrowed between the two security ministries . In addition to the army and MoI, there are two other security forces that are on the rise . One is the Popular Mobilisation forces , which seem to field approximately 100,000 troops, including a well-trained offensive cadre of around 20,000 fighters . The final potential force is the National Guard that is being considered as an option by Iraqi politicians . This force would, in theory, be trained, equipped and paid by the federal government, whilst being recruited and operated by the provincial councils . In a step towards this concept, a 5,000-strong US-equipped Tribal Security Force brigade has been provided with $13.5 million worth of US weapons and training in the new US Department of Defense budget . It is now up to Iraq's government whether the country will pay these troops as part of the first National Guard units in the forthcoming 2015 budget . It is also unclear exactly which ministry would administer the training, equipping and paying of National Guard troops: the US-backed Ministry of Defense (MoD) under Minister Khalid al-Ubeidi, a Sunni from Mosul, or the MoI, led by Badr leader Mohammed Ghabban, a close lieutenant of Badr leader Hadi al-Amiri . The scheme could become a way of permanently employing the Popular Mobilisation forces in the National Guard units of the predominately-Shia southern provinces . With the Kurdish Peshmerga representing another large force of around 54 brigades with 113,000 troops, the Iraqi army is thus on-track to become one of the smaller security forces in Iraq . In 2015, the army's performance and the international support provided to Iraq's MoD will be critical factors in determining the future of this proud institution . In the background, the slow process of rebuilding the army has already begun . New half-manned brigades are popping up at training bases in Nasiriya, Kirkush and at the collection points for the shattered army divisions across north- central Iraq . More units will follow in the coming months . Meanwhile a US-funded $1.6 billion train and equip programme will aim to produce a further nine full-strength Iraqi army brigades in 2015, adding a further 45,000 troops to the army and nearly doubling its frontline combat strength . (Three Peshmerga brigades or 15,000 troops will also be re-equipped under the programme) . The first of 250 US-provided Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles have arrived in Iraq, sent directly by the United States at no cost from Afghanistan . Another 3,496 tactical vehicles (Hummers, trucks, fuel tankers and engineering vehicles) will also be provided to the Iraqi army cost-free by the US military , and Iraq will probably buy a further 1,000 newly-built M1151A1 up-armoured Hummers in 2015 . If the US follows through on its pledges of training and equipment , the Iraqi army could survive its disastrous year in 2014 and play a key role in the struggle to evict Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces from cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah . The Iraqi army can draw on some illustrious history . In 1973, it deployed 18,000 troops with 300 tanks to save Damascus during the \"October War\" : this feat, mustering and moving an army 1,200km in just six days, remains deeply impressive . Iraq's five lightning offensives in April, May and June of 1988 shattered the Iranian army and were textbook examples of planning and execution . If the Iraqi army can be rebuilt with Shia, Sunni Arab and Kurdish political support , and if the well-led Ministry of Defense can guide the National Guard initiative , the coming year could witness new Iraqi army victories at Mosul . Successful operations undertaken by this national institution, with deep roots in the Iraq's history, will be far more beneficial to the country than victories scored solely by Shia militias or local Sunni uprisings, either of which could further fracture Iraq .",

            "input": "Let's see Turkey for what it really is. How times have changed . In the 18th century, Russian meddling in Crimea and Syria would have likely led to war with Turkey . Today, Russia's actions in the former Ottoman world mean a state visit for Russian President Vladimir Putin, discounted natural gas, and lucrative trade deals . Turkey's recent coziness with Russia, and its reluctance to take on the ISIL, have left many politicians in the West confused and frustrated . However , to understand Turkish foreign policy one must first look at US and European foreign policy . The lack of any coherent US-Middle East policy has made Turkey reluctant to respond to ISIL in any meaningful way . US President Barack Obama's disinterest in the region began with his hell-bent desire to remove all US forces from Iraq, no matter what the security situation was like . As far as Ankara was concerned, the US left behind unfinished business in Iraq . Next came the US response to the so-called Arab Spring , which amounted to telling regional autocrats that they had to go , and when they did not leave, the US failed to do anything about it . Perhaps the biggest failure of Obama's Middle East policy was drawing a \"red line\", and then failing to enforce it when Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own people . Pushing Turkey away . Since Turkey does not believe the US will see through to the completion of its mission to take on ISIL and force Assad out of power , understandably, Ankara has been reluctant to come on board . As far as Ankara is concerned, US creditability in the Middle East is bankrupt . It is not just US foreign policy pushing Turkey away from the West . This week, the EU's new foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, visited Ankara and told a group of journalists that the EU's \"top priority will be Turkey's EU accession process\" . After years of delays by Brussels, it is not likely anyone in Turkey will believe these words - nor should they . Europe's empty promises of EU membership, and its weak response over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has forced Turkey to hedge its bets that closer ties with Moscow are preferable to those with Brussels . Making a bad situation worse is the degree of European xenophobia lurking inside the debate around Turkish membership of the EU . Make no mistake ; Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not been the easiest leader for the West to work with . Apart from some of his more ridiculous, but harmless statements -\"Muslim sailors reached the American continent 314 years before Columbus, in 1178\" - many in the West have been put off by his crackdown on political dissent, limitations on press freedom, and his drive to bring a more conservative brand of Islam into what is still a largely secular society . Leaders in the West would be wise not to dismiss Turkey altogether because of Erdogan's ironfisted leadership style . Turkey is a parliamentary democracy , but as the president, Erdogan derives his extensive powers because his Justice and Development Party (AKP) currently controls parliament . Without an AKP majority in parliament, the centre of power in Turkish politics is likely to shift back to the prime minister's office . In June, Turkey will hold its next parliamentary elections - and if the elections are anything like Turkey's 2014 presidential elections , the race will be close . If the AKP does not get a majority, or if they have to form a coalition , Erdogan's power and influence will be significantly curtailed . Turkey is situated in a dangerous neighbourhood . It has land borders with Syria, Iraq, and Iran . Its border with Armenia is closed . A recent investigation uncovered a terror organisation operating inside Turkey with links to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps . ISIL controls huge swaths of land along the Turkish border with Syria and Iran . The threat from Assad is so great that NATO currently provides air defence units to protect Turkish airspace . It is clear that foreign policy decisions taken by the US and Europe have left Turkey feeling exposed . Short-sighted leaders in the West need to open their eyes and see Turkey for what it really is: a valued NATO partner, a secular state (at least for now) bridging Europe and the Islamic world, a developing economy and a major player in the energy market . What a tragedy it would be if broken promises from Europe, combined with a lack of US leadership and strategy in the Middle East, results in a Turkey that becomes more fundamentalist, anti-western, and pro- Russian .",

Particularly when said storms feature figures who like to think of themselves as controversial and as deliberately baiting us : Rihanna posing in a clingy burqa at a mosque, Mario Balotelli posting a racist image , and now Madonna doctoring pictures of African and African-American leaders to promote her new album . Really, the only dignified thing to do is to not dignify it with a response, and move on . Who cares if Madonna straps black ropes on the images of dead black rights icons? As Peter Robinson wrote in the Guardian:\"It's slightly heartbreaking that Madonna, an artist who made her name through an intuitive grasp of almost every major trend and zeitgeist fluctuation, is so crap at social media.\" But sometimes a solely jaded response betrays our own complacency, like resigning yourself to the fact that there will always be people who think of racist slurs as banter , or those who think it is just fine to appropriate the symbols of others to give their own tepid existence some edge , or people who still wear bootcut jeans . It's not OK, no matter how persistent and ever- present it is . Even though Madonna has always been controversial , it also seems that as the world around her has got sharper, she has got duller and more derivative . The appropriation that she and others have carried out is nothing new ; we're just noticing it more . That's because those who are piggybacking on others' journeys do not only have more channels to flaunt their cluelessness and sense of entitlement (Iggy Azalea, walk away from Twitter) but they are also being called out on it more . Whether it is usurping religion - crucifixes and nun habits are passe now; it's niqabs on naked bodies  - keep up - homosexuality or now minority rights , Madonna is a manifestation of how privilege feeds off the authenticity of \"struggle\" . This is a double plundering that leads to further marginalisation : the dominant narrative will oppress you, then co-opt you, and then weave you into your own tiny little section of the tapestry . Some would argue that slavery and segregation ended long ago (well, segregation in the US in the 60s and apartheid in South African in the 90s, so not that long ago) . But that doesn't mean white people can now happily vandalise the cultural and historical totems of a minority's struggle as part of some universal poster for the white western narrative of overcoming and learning from our mistakes . Imagine a pop artist using the recent CIA torture as part of their campaign - perhaps showing dead Arab personalities being waterboarded . No? Too soon? Well , when it comes to certain issues , it will always too soon . Of course ,  the charitable position is that Madonna, or to a different extent, Iggy Azalea, are not doing this with any high degree of self-awareness or design - they might see all contemporary culture as equal-access human heritage that they can dip into and sample as a vehicle for their talent . They would be right to some extent , but the sad fact is that these modern iterations of minority culture that they are sampling all arose from suffering and oppression rather than from a series of tortured geniuses in drawing rooms across Europe . Yes, there are spaces where our common mix of religious, sexual and racial legacies intermingle - gloriously, sometimes . But that is usually an uncurated, spontaneous thing, not a cynical shopping list . To put it simply , edginess comes from just that : being on the edge . Ironically, all Madonna and her ilk's desperate antics to appear so only confirm that they are, in fact, utterly comfortable and mainstream . Cultural appropriation is now the standard default of the unoriginal . It is a common and predictable template , where one becomes a cliche in trying to avoid being a cliche because you have nothing new to offer - something Madonna would surely be mortified by .",

Even political obsessives quail at the thought . So I plead guilty to bringing a little genuine political debate into the process so early on in the process . The issue is the new Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, and his vainglorious boast that he is going to use mansion tax money from London and the south-east to pay for 1,000 new nurses in Scotland . Let me stress that I support the mansion tax in principle . It is a redistributive tax , which is important , and taxes on assets are always worth considering . The complication is that it is, in effect, a tax on London, 80% of which will be paid by people in London and the south -east . And the distorted nature of London's housing market could mean a tax with wildly distorted effects . No one really knows how much it will raise . It seems likely that the people everyone agrees should pay it- the international super-wealthy - will use their expensive lawyers and accountants to evade it . But it will hit older Londoners, often public sector workers who bought houses in what were then unfashionable parts of London , as in my constituency, Hackney North and Stoke Newington . Now they are living in houses worth ? 1m and rising . They are often asset rich but cash poor . Having seen London house prices spiral in value , they are not reassured by the idea that the mansion tax kicks in only at? 2m . At the very least, a lot of work needs to be put in to reassure those voters, and to fashion a tax that will not hit those people unfairly . Fortunately the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has an open mind on the subject . That is why it is surprising that Murphy has jumped in feet first, boasting about how he will spend money from a tax when there is no agreement on exactly how it will be levied . I am a unionist , and I understand that the Labour party has a big electoral challenge in Scotland . But I cannot believe that Scottish voters will be taken in by a crude attempt to buy their votes with money expropriated from London . If Murphy is really interested in redistributing wealth , why isn't he talking about council tax revaluation or levels of income tax in Scotland? Instead he seeks cheap applause by telling the Scots how he will extract money from England . Recently there has been a series of reports, including from the London Finance Commission and the Royal Society of Arts City Growth Commission, calling for the devolution of powers to our great cities . In particular ,  experts are saying that big cities should be allowed to keep their property taxes - I believe that this process should start with the mansion tax . Devolution cannot be for Scotland alone ; there should also be devolution of powers to the cities and regions . Murphy cannot bully the rest of the UK about a considered devolution of fiscal powers to all our cities with a pre-emptive strike on the mansion tax . It is too easy to conflate London with bankers and the international glitterati . But London is more unequal than any other part of Britain . Child poverty is a third higher in London than the rest of England as a whole . So, general election campaign or not, we need a proper debate on devolution of powers to our great cities . It is part of the battle against the poverty that still exists in the shadow of the glittering towers of the City of London . And some people need to be prepared to stand up for London in this important debate .",

How precious in the sight of progressives was one of their saints, Mario Cuomo, the three-term governor of New York who died last week at age 82 . He was a model of progressivism and a gifted rhetorician . In most media accounts, references were made to two speeches Cuomo delivered in 1984, one at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco where Walter Mondale was nominated for president, and the other at the University of Notre Dame where Cuomo spoke about abortion and the \"proper\" role of religion in politics . The thing about progressivism is that it resembles floor wax -- all shine and no depth . In his Democratic convention speech, Cuomo referenced Ronald Reagan's line about America being a \"shining city on a hill.\" Cuomo responded,\"A shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House or the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well . But there's another city; there' s another part to the shining city.... In this part of the city, there are more poor than ever . More families in trouble . More and more people who need help but can't find it . ... There are people who sleep in the city streets, in the gutter where the glitter doesn't show.\" This is boilerplate Democratic rhetoric we've heard since the days of Franklin Roosevelt . After Democrats Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama, are fewer families in trouble? Are there fewer poor people, especially since Johnson's \"War on Poverty\" promised to end it? Statistics reveal there are not , so why do so many embrace progressive ideas? If something isn't working , why repeat the errors? As Reagan noted, government too often adds to problems ; it doesn' t solve them . Government doesn't create jobs ; a thriving private economy does . Government welfare mostly doesn't incentivize people to escape poverty, but too often sustains them in poverty and addicts them to government handouts . On the issue of church and state, Cuomo bisected the subjects in his Notre Dame speech . While he said he accepted Catholic teaching against capital punishment , he rejected its opposition to abortion . In this, the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin expressed opposition to both issues while eloquently arguing that the Catholic Church believes that each is part of a \"seamless garment\" of life and that all life matters and should not be taken by individuals, or the state . This is another flaw of progressivism . Progressives are happy to embrace church teachings when it favors their political agenda, but reject them when those teachings don't conform to their politics . My one encounter with Cuomo came after a column I wrote following his 2007 debate with former Speaker Newt Gingrich at Cooper Union in New York, the site of a famous speech by Abraham Lincoln . I said that Gingrich clearly won the debate and made a mockery of Cuomo's liberalism . Cuomo called me and after identifying himself launched into a tirade that lasted about 90 seconds . He then hung up giving me no opportunity to say much more than \"hello, nice to hear from you.\" Vanity . Vanity . Most obituaries and news reports called Cuomo \"inspiring.\" A New York Times editorial correctly noted:\"For all his idealism, Mr  Cuomo's years as governor were dogged by economic recession that blunted his hopes to leave great programs and innovation as his legacy . He had to cut services and scratch for scarce revenue.\" Inspiration is good if it motivates people to do for themselves and improve their lives . Otherwise ,  it's nothing more than floor wax . May Gov  Cuomo rest in peace .",

The Marshall Islands - a country of about 70,000 people located in the Pacific Ocean - is taking the world's nine nuclear powers to court for allegedly violating international obligations to work towards nuclear disarmament . The list of accused is as follows: the United States, Russia, Britain, China, France, India, North Korea, Pakistan, and Israel . Israel has made the cut despite fervently denying possession of a nuclear arsenal . The spectacle is unfolding at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the main judicial organ of the United Nations . A recent New York Times article on the Marshall Islands' \"near-Quixotic venture\" quotes Phon van den Biesen, head of the country's legal team, on the ultimate aim of the effort: \"All the nuclear weapons states are modernising their arsenals instead of negotiating[to disarm], and we want the court to rule on this.\" A continuing history . The Islands' move might come off as more than a bit incongruous given its established existence as a pillar of the US-Israeli axis in UN forums . Glance at any review of General Assembly votes on Israel/Palestine issues and you'll find the Marshall Islands regularly represented in the exclusive anti- Palestine camp, along with a smattering of other obscure Pacific atolls . The fact that justice in Palestine continues to be as elusive as ever, despite nominal support from an overwhelming majority of countries, underscores both the general futility of taking on the powers that be as well as the frequent toothlessness of rulings emanating from UN institutions . The Marshall Islands presumably has some inkling of the force it's now up against . To be sure, Marshall Islanders are well acquainted with the horrors of the nuclear arms industry . The diminutive nation happens to be the site of no fewer than 67 US nuclear bomb tests in the 1940s and 50s, during an almost 40-year period in which the US administered the Islands under a UN trusteeship . As Greenpeace notes, one of these tests involved a bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 . Such machinations have predictably resulted in thorough environmental contamination and continuing health complications for the local population, ranging from radiogenic cancers to babies born without bones . As Marshallese nuclear survivor Lemeyo Abon told the UN Human Rights Council in 2012:\"After the [US] testing programme we've had to create new words to describe the creatures we give birth to.\" Lexical fallout aside, other US contributions to Marshallese culture include the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll , which continues to generate revenue for US corporations . The widespread territorial displacement necessitated by the previous era of fanatical nuclear testing meanwhile highlights the irony of Marshallese government support for the US-funded entity that displaces and otherwise oppresses Palestinians . Of course , human beings are contradictory creatures , and nations composed of lots of human beings are thus inevitably also contradictory . But in assessing the prospects for the Islands' foray into the International Court of Justice, it's worth taking the contradictions into account . Connecting the dots . The New York Times points out that the court case \"comes as nuclear arms are increasingly being linked to other pressing international issues\" such as climate change  - which produces rising sea levels that incidentally also pose an existential threat to the Marshall Islands . The Times quotes Marshallese Foreign Minister Tony de Brum on the seemingly parallel threats to survival:\"What would it gain mankind to reach a peaceful resolution of the climate change threat, only to be wiped out by a nuclear misunderstanding?\" There are certainly common denominators between climate change and nukes - not least that both are filed away in many of our brains under the category of things that we know can swiftly destroy us but would prefer not to think about . However ,  there appears to be a missing link in de Brum's analysis , because you can't resolve the climate change threat without resolving the business of imperial militarism, in both its nuclear and non-nuclear varieties . The connection between the military-industrial complex and environmental catastrophe is fairly clearly spelled out in Project Censored's annual report from 2010 , which confirms the US Department of Defense as the worst polluter on the planet . This is not to imply, obviously, that the US constitutes the one and only problem for the earth ; it's simply to draw attention to the superior egregiousness of American earthly violations . Had there been an Ayatollah Khomeini Ballistic Missile Test Site in the mix somewhere, folks might be more willing to connect the dots . While it may not be very coherent of the Marshall Islands to assist the empire in some destructive endeavours and take it to task for others , its nuclear lawsuit should nonetheless be encouraged  - if for no other reason than the possibly vain hope that awareness can help combat inertia . And another vain hope: that with attention will come context .",

Max Factor has appointed Marilyn Monroe as its new \"global ambassador\", leaving some people bemused at the idea of selecting an ambassador who has been dead since 1962 . They seem to suspect this might limit her diplomatic utility . But Monroe represents just what Max Factor wants to resuscitate: the glamour for which the company was once a byword . In the era of classic Hollywood (about 1920-1965), Max Factor ran the only cosmetic game in town , pioneering the use of makeup for cinema, and then, with his sons, adapting and selling those products commercially . Monroe remains one of the most iconic Hollywood movie stars , and Max Factor's spokeswoman said they chose her because she epitomises their history . \"Marilyn made the sultry red lip, creamy skin and dramatically lined eyes the most famous beauty look of the 1940s, and it's a look that continues to dominate the beauty and fashion industry. It is the ultimate look that defines glamour - nothing else compares,\" the spokeswoman said . The campaign will emphasise Monroe's metamorphosis, it was reported this week, from \"mousey\" Norma Jeane Mortenson to glamorous Marilyn Monroe, a decision that seems, at face value, rather canny . Certainly it has stirred up a bit of welcome publicity around the campaign , which claims in particular that it was Max Factor Jr's idea to bleach the star's naturally chestnut hair to that famous platinum blonde . The ad campaign reads: \"From Norma Jeane to Marilyn Monroe. Created By Max Factor.\" Hang on, boys . Created by whom? If Max Factor wants to emphasise history it should start by paying a little more attention to it . Monroe had her first - tiny - film role in 1947 ; she did not have her first starring role until 1952 . Throughout the 1940s, she was still \"mousey\" Norma Jeane . For my book on Monroe, I read every major biography then published, as well as many ancillary accounts - about 300 books in all . Not one reported that Max Factor suggested the aspiring starlet should bleach her hair . I don't think any of them mentioned Max Factor at all . Instead ,  nearly all credit a woman named Emmeline Snively, the head of Monroe's first modelling agency, with whom she signed in 1945 . Snively gave Marilyn lessons in fashion, lighting and grooming, and, most biographers report, recommended that she lighten her hair , \"because a blonde could be photographed in any wardrobe and in any light\" . By 1946 the model Norma Jeane had appeared on 33 magazine covers - quite a feat for a \"mousey\" young woman waiting to be created by Max Factor . Marilyn Monroe was not created by Max Factor - or by her studio head, Darryl F Zanuck(who hated her); or by her agent, Johnny Hyde, who paid for her to have minor plastic surgery (to the tip of her nose and her jawline) and got her first big roles; or by any of her directors, or husbands, or any other of a legion of men, and a handful of women , who have tried to claim the credit, now including Max Factor's heirs . She was not created by makeup, in any sense : cosmetics were not sufficient to create Marilyn Monroe , and neither were other people . Emmeline Snively herself said that what distinguished the girl she knew was how hard she worked : \"She wanted to learn, wanted to be somebody, more than anybody I ever saw before in my life.\" Everyone from Elton John to Joyce Carol Oates(who should know better) has trotted out this tenacious, tiresome story : \"ordinary\" Norma Jeane was changed by someone else into the glamorous movie star Marilyn Monroe . But Norma Jeane Baker, as she was known in childhood(Mortenson was the name on her birth certificate, but she never knew her father), was always an extremely beautiful girl . An army photographer discovered her when she was 19, working at a munitions factory . She went on to be a popular model on the cover of dozens of magazines before she bleached her hair or focused her look . There was never anything \"mousey\" about this woman , and when she changed her hair, her makeup, and her name , she didn't become a different person . She created an iconic style , which she developed in collaboration with her personal makeup artist for many years, Whitey Snyder . No doubt Marilyn attended the Max Factor beauty salon near Hollywood Boulevard in the 1940s, along with hundreds of other young starlets . I have no reason to disbelieve that she may have worked with Max Factor Jr himself in the 1950s, once she was famous . But no one except Marilyn Monroe created Marilyn Monroe , and in 2015 it's past time for us to give credit to the woman who earned it .",

            "input": "Muslims in the news only when they're behind the gun. Ahmed Merabat was the first of the 12 innocents killed in Wednesday's targeted attack on the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo . The 42-year-old French Muslim policeman was executed on the sidewalk of Paris' 11th borough - the enclave where Charlie Hebdo's headquarters is located . Merabat was shot, point-blank, by one of the three assassins, minutes before they broke into Charlie Hebdo's offices, and slaughtered the magazine's top editor and celebrated cartoonists . The coverage of the \"Paris shootings\" centred almost exclusively on Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut and Bernard Verlhac - the prominent and unyieldingly provocative minds behind Charlie Hebdo . The first victim, Ahmed Merabat, was purged from the headlines . The political and representational ramifications that come with highlighting Merabat's victimhood cannot be ignored . First ,  it complicates the broader narrative that rigidly caricatures Muslims as terrorists, outsiders and marginals . And second, refutes the state-sponsored indictment of Muslims in France as perpetrators of subversion, instead of law-abiding citizens . Muslim and French . Apart from the obvious tragedy, the Charlie Hebdo killings manifest the baseline that Muslim identity is only relevant - and indeed newsworthy - when the subject is standing behind the gun. Not in front of it . In most everywhere in the world, but especially France - the architect of modern Islamophobia . Muslims comprise a considerable percentage of the French polity . Islam is the nation's second biggest religion , and figures place the Muslim population at 5 percent to 10 percent of France's 66 million citizens . Islam's size, and demographical rise, has spurred some of the most draconian policies against Muslims in modern times . The headscarf ban in 2004, followed by illegalisation of the niqab, or face covering, in 2010, codified core Islamophobic ideas . This legislation also functioned as a firm and fervent declaration by the state that Muslim and French identities were at odds and irreconcilable . The French laicite model provided the structural underpinnings to carry forward Islamophobic legislation . But more nefariously, guise it under the banner of state-sponsored secularism . Expectedly, the religious expression bans disparately impacted French Muslims . In addition ,  they chilled bodily and verbal expressions of Muslim identity . The state aim of compelling secularisation upon its Muslim citizenry was based upon the civilisational binary, and ultimatum, to choose between \"Islam and the West\", \"Muslim lands or France\" . Despite this ultimatum handed down from the state, the overwhelming majority of French Muslims exercised their faith amid pervasive bigotry . And simultaneously, embraced their national identities as Frenchmen and women . Extreme voices from within the state, and French civil society, looked to the three terrorists as representatives of the nation's 3 to 6 million Frenchmen and women . Collateral indictment of French Muslims, by politicians and media alike, infused with an already fervent culture of Islamophobia on the ground, will surely incite violent backlash against Muslims and Muslim communities in the country . Although unimaginable before Wednesday, French Islamophobia stands to become far more severe and strident . The conflation of the terrorist's acts with France's Muslim population, from the perspective of hatemongers, holds the latter vicariously liable . This connection, that links three deviant actors with an entire faith and millions of disconnected citizens, will fuel rabid backlash against Muslims in France, and more than likely, claim additional victims . Centring Muslim victims, instead of villains, would mitigate the backlash considerably . In addition , focusing on the heroics of Merabat, instead of the evil of the three terrorists, asserts - and inserts - a competing narrative that France's Muslims are everyday citizens : Citizens with jobs, families, and interpretations of Islam that condemn violence, and contradict the malignant caricature of the faith constructed by the state . Ahmed Merabat was more than a victim . He was far more than merely a Muslim . He, in both life and especially in death, stands as an archetype for the overwhelming majority of French Muslims . A law-abiding citizen, Merabat harmonised his religious identity with the responsibilities of being a Frenchman . He was both French and Muslim , an existential integration eviscerated by the longstanding Islamophobic discourse in France, and ignored by the media firestorm following the attack . Although the first victim of the attack, Ahmed Merabat's story was shot down from the news headlines . And his name and face absent from the ongoing stream of reports and narratives emanating from Paris on Wednesday . Inserting him into the story, and countering the barrage of vile Muslim representations with a rebuttal of victimhood and valour, will likely save lives in France . Most importantly, retelling the story from the perspective of Ahmed Merabat will not only reveal that Muslim and French identity are reconcilable, but also resilient .",

            "input": "My brain tumour will be removed this week, and I can be thankful. On the morning of my diagnosis I rush to get ready for work . It's 6am and I make a cup of black tea . As I carry it across the room , even though I'm being careful, I spill most of the boiling liquid, burning my hand . What's wrong with me, I think . By 10.30am my GP will telephone me at work with the results of a brain scan I had a couple of days before: an acoustic neuroma, sitting behind my right ear, 42mm in size - a brain tumour . The GP says that, so as not to delay things, he's faxing the referral to neurosurgery right away for urgent attention . Faxing? \"Any change,\" he says,\"go to A&E  ;\". \"Change? What does that mean?\" I ask , becoming more alarmed with every word he says . \"Have you been sick?\" he asks . \"No.\" \"That's good.\" I feel sick . Diagnosis is a long, arduous path that is difficult to navigate . People get sick of you being sick and stop listening . To the untrained eye I look fine . But look closer and you'll see that I can't close my right eye , so it doesn't blink . My face is sagging on the right side , I get sores on the right-hand corner of my mouth due to the drool that manages to escape because of facial weakness on that side . Less obvious are the hidden symptoms . Right-sided facial numbness; overwhelming fatigue; tinnitus and reduced hearing in my right ear; a lack of co-ordination leading to an overpowering unsteadiness . All because I have this 42mm tumour that is taking up space in my head, slowly strangling the nerves relating to hearing, balance and facial sensation . I feel stupid for not noticing and not pursuing some of the symptoms when I first experienced them years ago . I listened to others too much when they told me it was normal and didn't listen to myself when I knew it was not . There is a certain amount of relief when you finally get a diagnosis, especially one so definitive . At the end of November, the moment I found out, work sent me home and there I have been ever since . Later that week I get a call from my bank . \"Sorry for not calling,\" I say,\"I've had a pretty rough week.\" I nearly tell them I've just found out I've got a brain tumour , but I catch myself . I realise how powerful that news is . It can get you out of almost anything . I've felt the power every time I've said it , but I still don't believe it's happening to me . My sister had breast cancer three years ago and it's taken all this time to stop the illness dominating her life . She has stopped obsessively searching for lumps, and says:\"It's history, old news, like it happened to someone else.\" Will I ever acknowledge the reality of what's happening to me? I'm a 41-year- old woman, married, with no kids by choice . Children would mess up the vice- like grip my husband and I like to have on our lives . My morning commute takes an hour and a half so I read prolifically . I manage a small IT team at a prominent university . Apart from reading I love to cook . That's who I am: work, reading and cooking . Sounds boring, but I loved it . I haven't finished a book since being sent home from work . And don't ask me what's for dinner . I'll become dithery and confused, and eventually settle on cheese and crackers . After the relief of diagnosis, fear sets in . I know the snail's pace at which the NHS usually moves , so watching it jump into action induces panic in me . Within a couple of days, the hotshot neurosurgeon calls . He tells me it is a slow-growing tumour that I have probably had for years and that a few more weeks while they plan my operation won't make any difference . He tells me that as acoustic neuromas go, this one's big , but the good news is it's benign, it's not cancer , though it must come out and soon . Then the bad news- I will lose all hearing in that ear and one side of my face may be permanently paralysed from the operation . The news that I didn't have cancer didn't register ; I was too busy counting my losses . A few days later I went to a support group for people with brain tumours , where I met people with brain cancer . Their lumps were in places like the memory, speech or personality part of their brains , and for some the prognosis wasn't good . The phone call they got from their doctors was much worse than mine . I came away feeling grateful, devastatingly so . It sounds vain , but facial paralysis bothers me more than deafness . People will be able to see there is something wrong . I worry that they'll stop seeing me and see only a problem with my face . Not satisfied with taking half my hearing, the surgeon may take away my smile, my frown and that weird raised eyebrow look I've inherited from my dad . Not being able to express myself in full feels like I'm losing a big part of who I am . Admittedly, that is a woman who has worked in London for more than 20 years, trained in the art of remaining expressionless and speaking to no one . Now I smile or speak to strangers, luxuriating in my facial movements . I find much more to smile about nowadays . The internet tells me these types of tumours grow at a rate of about 1mm a year . If they have a spurt they might make it to 2mm a year . Has the tumour been growing all of my life? I think back to key moments : did I miss out on promotions due to the fatigue of a growing tumour? I did a degree part-time a few years ago and got a 2:1 . I now think my certificate should say 2:1 (with a brain tumour) . The morning after my diagnosis I was woken up by The Voice . Wake up, it said, there' s lots to do . It has been telling me what to do ever since , and so far it has never been wrong . We all have that voice , but the busyness of our lives causes it to fade into the background . Never has mine been so loud . Do yoga , it will improve your balance . Call your brother who you haven't spoken to in two years . Write a thank-you letter to the doctor who diagnosed you . Tell them you're scared before you have that brain scan . Write a will . My operation, a craniotomy, is planned for this coming Thursday . I have two main worries . The first is the horror of surrendering myself to it . I have to turn up at the hospital at 7.30am . They are trusting me to have eaten or drunk nothing for at least six hours . Like an inmate at a prison, I will have my possessions checked in . They will give me a gown to wear that is not my own . Then I will say goodbye to my husband, not knowing when I will see him again . Depending on the hotshot neurosurgeon's schedule I may have to wait a number of hours, empty-bellied and frightened . Eventually I will have one side of my head shaved before they put me to sleep . Don't make me do this voluntarily . Treat me like a wild animal running through the woods, take me out with a sedative dart when I am cooking or doing my favourite yoga pose . Then let me wake up when it is all over . Don't tell me I am brave . The people who choose to get involved with me are the brave ones . My husband, for picking me up every time I fall over when I lose my balance physically - and metaphorically . My mother, for clearing her schedule for as long as it takes to get me better . People like my yoga teacher , who didn't run a mile when I approached her for help, but instead restored some of my balance and made me feel strong . My second worry is something I've never been good at in my life . Now I must face it head-on - the unknown . The doctors can't tell me how long my hospital stay will be . Will they need to open me up again because my brain is bleeding? Will I have to have a shunt fitted because fluid isn't draining from my head? Will the surgeon sneeze and nick my facial nerve? Most suffering is in the worry . It means I have to live in the lacuna of uncertainty, embracing not knowing and carrying on , a new skill I practise daily . I know that if you take my life as a whole this is an interruption . This will end . I refuse to make it who I am, my identity . Rather ,  it is an experience, one that leaves its imprint on my body . It has brought my life into sharp focus and revealed what I have to be thankful for: people, strangers and intimates for their kindness and well wishing; my tenacity and determination for carrying me through; and as much as I'm trying to shake it off, my plan for creating a freezer-full of food to be eaten post-op . I am ready .",

            "input": "Inside the National Gallery, a portrait of modern inequality. The National Gallery's colonnaded splendour radiates across Trafalgar Square a sense of the importance of art in Britain's national life . But the reality inside is far less glorious . The 400 gallery assistants are about to be outsourced to a private company against their will, to squeeze pay and conditions . A ballot by their union, PCS, closes this week, calling for a five-day strike in protest . All day they guard the nation's treasures: not automata, but well-informed, if untrained, guides who like to be asked questions, know where paintings are, are glad to advise nervous visitors unsure what to look at . Some have worked there for 40 years , some are younger, many former art students . Ben, who has been there for over a decade since art school, is an artist when not at work stopping people poking the paintings . His favourite beat is the impressionists and Van Gogh , where he sends the ditherers : all assistants have their preferences, he says (Poussin and the French classicists being the least popular) . A letter to staff from the director, Nicholas Penny, says all gallery services go out to tender in April, something no other national gallery or museum has done . That includes visitor services, school bookings, public information and even complaints . As Tupe - Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) - regulations require, staff will transfer to a private company on the same terms , but that's weak protection : they can be sent to work anywhere in that company . As one fearful gallery assistant says:\"I came to work at the National Gallery, but I could be transferred to a supermarket car park.\" This is the only national museum in London not paying the living wage . A tangle of pay rates means that older staff (predominantly male) are paid more than newer (predominantly female) . But even if men and women's pay were equalised , many of the older staff would still lose out . The gallery's grant is being cut , so it needs to make more money with extra paid evening events . Staff are willing - but expect extra pay . Management says negotiations went nowhere , so they have to go nuclear: let a private company get tough with them . Some would leave : they note that the security firm CIS, brought in to staff the recent Rembrandt exhibition, took away the chairs used by the gallery's own guards . That's how private companies profit from these contracts : as old staff leave, new staff can be hired at any pay rate . One gallery trustee I spoke to admitted that CIS had been brought in to run the Sainsbury wing to give the gallery staff a fright . CIS, if you look at its website , mostly provides heavies to guard empty buildings, not talk to the public . Most trustees, I'm told, would like to keep the staff in-house . What happens in hard times is always the same : spreadsheets show the most crushable item is staff . Numbers are cut and squeezed hard for longer hours . Vital breaks in a long day are eliminated . Changing into your uniform or taking your tea break has to happen on unpaid time . It's easier to let ruthless companies to do the dirty work , so squeamish managers can wash their hands of consequences . Both sides will now go to Acas : there is still time to pull back from this privatisation too far . This shedding of long-term employees is emblematic of low-pay Britain , where a million public jobs are being lost . Public servants are more unionised than other workforces, and so irksome to managers who eye a commercial world of 19th century employment practices - lump labour on zero hours, temp agencies, free interns, the bogus self-employed free of national insurance . The public servants' ethos, their attachment to the civic realm, has been systematically trashed as mere unionised self-interest . What's afoot at the gallery explains why pay is falling as a share of GDP . Galloping inequality is the result of a million such decisions employers think prudent , mainly because everyone is doing it . The derelict Low Pay Commission has let the minimum wage itself fall? 1,000 in real value since 2008 . The Tory call last week for higher wages was breathtaking dishonesty , echoing the TUC's \"Britain Needs a Pay Rise\" campaign . The government has huge sway over pay . If it demanded the living wage not just for its employees, but also from every contractor and supplier , then national pay norms would rise instantly . If the Low Pay Commission set higher minimums appropriate to each sector , like the old wages councils, larger companies could pay decent salaries according to profitability . The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's latest report finds 40% of families with children living below a minimum threshold of decency . Most are in work- but earning too little to buy what a majority of the public in focus groups consider essentials for participation in society: no drink or cigarettes,? 5 a fortnight for eating out, ? 40 for Christmas food, one week's UK holiday . That takes an income of ? 20,400 a year for a couple with two children  - which is almost? 3,000 more than National Gallery assistants earn . GDP growth is near invisible to the 8 million squeezed hardest, by this government's deliberate choice : average income loss since 2010 is? 33 a week . Now the government promises full employment - but what kind? Most new jobs are low paid, precarious and part time . For all George Osborne's hi-vis posturing about his sham \"northern powerhouse\", the latest figures from the Centre for Cities show how far the gap between the south and the rest has widened . At Davos this week, central bankers will echo the fashionable view that accelerating inequality is the real economic risk, a danger to capitalism itself . Oxfam tells them 1% of the population will by next year own more of the world's wealth than the other 99% : in Britain, the top 1% has soared away , and the bottom 10% has done worst while paying the highest proportion of its income in taxes: 47% . But no sign yet that the Davos set is worrying unduly: by Epiphany- 6 January - FTSE 100 chief executives had already earned more than a year of the average wage . How do you wrest back wealth from them? Restoring power to unions would help , ensuring every workplace is offered union membership . Instead ,  Cameron's manifesto will make strikes near-impossible, with a 40% ballot threshold unknown anywhere in the democratic west . That's a reason to hope the ever- patient attendants at the National Gallery resist being cast out to G4S, Serco and the rest- and remain as treasured employees of us all . o This article was amended on 20 January 2015 . An earlier version said:\"Oxfam tells them 1% of the population will next year own 99% of the world's wealth\" . This has been corrected to:\"Oxfam tells them 1% of the population will by next year own more of the world's wealth than the other 99%\" .",

            "input": "NATO's nuclear relapse. Moscow's latest tests of intercontinental missiles and its parading of nuclear capable strategic bombers have rightly prompted international concern . In December 2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov implied that Russia might be moving nuclear weapons to Crimea . From violations of airspace to near mid-air collisions, the number of incidents between Russia and NATO has soared dramatically , increasing the danger of an unintended escalation . Yet ,  it is rarely mentioned that NATO, too, is back in the game of nuclear deterrence . Washington has recently sent its nuclear capable B-2 and B-52 to Europe for training missions with its NATO partners . It also continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles . Most problematically, the western military alliance is currently modernising the air-launched nuclear gravity bombs that fall under NATO's nuclear sharing initiative . It is a warm afternoon and thick clouds hang over the houses and farmyards of Buchel, a small village in western Germany and home to 20 of NATO's remaining thermonuclear bombs on European soil . Or so we can only speculate, for the exact location of these approximately 180 air-launched B61 weapons is of course secret . The local baker smiles uneasily when I ask her about the base and is quick to assure me that there is nothing to see . After a 20-minute walk through muddy fields, I can glimpse a large barbed wire fence on the horizon and what seems to be a succession of bunkeresque fortifications . A biting smell of kerosene creeps up my nose . A sign warns me that soldiers may make use of their weapons if I enter . As I walk back across the fields, I frighten a herd of deer that scramble into the bushes . Suddenly, a jet plane soars into the sky with a deafening thunder . In the event of a nuclear war, it would most likely be heading East from here . Designed in the 1960s for use by high-speed aircraft, the thermonuclear B61 is a versatile weapon that comes both as an intermediate range strategic and a short-range tactical weapon with a wide variety of yields . A relic of the early Cold War, it is not just a US but a \"NATO weapon\" in that its stationing and delivery also involves non-nuclear member states, such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey . Tactical nukes are particularly problematic because their short range provides the missing link between a localised conventional war and a highly improbable global exchange of strategic nuclear missiles between Moscow and Washington . Tactical nuclear weapons are no status quo weapons . Their battlefield purpose increases the chance of a nuclear escalation , which is why the superpowers removed most of them from Central Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s . If everything goes to plan , the controversial B61 weapons will be modernised by around 2020 . This \"life extension programme\" is not simply an initiative to replace rusty old nukes with shiny new ones, but an attempt to increase their accuracy, to replace free fall with precision guided bombs . Ultimately, this will transform the B61 into a new kind of weapon and undermine any pretence that the West is still in the game of denuclearisation . Interestingly, plans to modernise the B61 were initiated in April 2010, only shortly after NATO decided to scrap its nuclear missile shield in Eastern Europe and in the same month that the two largest nuclear powers signed a new Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty . How does NATO explain this nuclear relapse precisely at a time when the alliance had just \"reset\" its relations with Russia? And what role does the B61 play in the Ukrainian proxy war? Jamie Shea is famous in Brussels for his rhetorical skill, expressive body language and London twang . \"He could sell you a landmine if he wanted to\", an activist once told me about the man who spun NATO's war against Serbia to a lethargic European public 15 years ago . The alliance's Deputy Assistant Secretary General has come to University College London to talk to students about the Ukrainian crisis and Europe's new security architecture . Charming his audience with jokes and anecdotes , Shea tells the story of an underfunded alliance that urgently needs to up its military game if it wants to stand up to Putin's Russia . He is excited about NATO's new \"very high readiness joint task force\" and about new and larger planned NATO manoeuvrrs in Eastern Europe . One topic he has precious little to say about is the alliance's nuclear policy . When I prompt him , Shea explains that while the life extension programme was originally meant to provide NATO with a bargaining chip for future nuclear disarmament talks with the Kremlin, Russia's involvement in Eastern Ukraine fundamentally altered the strategic context, rendering the B61 \"once again a part of NATO's deterrence posture\" . \"I'm not nostalgic for the Cold War\", he laughs,\"but you have to prepare for Cold War mark two even if you don't want it\" . In this, Shea is on the same page as US Secretary of State John Kerry who recently claimed that the crisis in Ukraine was calling NATO\"back to the role that this alliance was originally created to perform\" . Why this relapse to what Shea calls\"the nuclear game\"? The first part of the answer lies in NATO's recent failures . Clearly, the stand off with Russia is a welcome distraction from its fiasco in Afghanistan and the alliance's lack of a purpose in the absence of Milosevic or Gaddafi . Yet ,  there is more to this than just an identity crisis . NATO, as Trine Flockhardt so aptly puts it, is something of a \"nuclear addict\" - it hangs on to its nuclear weapons despite frequently declaring its desire to abandon them . Both US President Obama and NATO's new General Secretary Stoltenberg are known advocates of nuclear disarmament - but in 2014 their alliance is stepping up its nuclear deterrence and the US administration is pouring $1trn into the future of its nuclear weapons systems . There are obvious pressures behind this nuclear habit, from the nuclear arms industry via hawkish politicians and generals to certain Eastern European NATO members - but the real issue is a lack of public scrutiny . In the UK, the debate about nuclear weapons tends to concentrate on Britain's nuclear submarines and what would happen to them if Scotland declared independence . The US is currently preoccupied with the safety of its nuclear silos . These issues are of course important , but they should not cause us to overlook NATO's nuclear relapse . People like Shea publicly admit their relief that the public has kept so quiet about nuclear weapons since the end of the Cold War . Indeed ,  governments remember all too well their predecessors' struggles with the peace and anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s . This is why today's NATO does\"not want to wake up a sleeping dog\", he explains . In 2014, the spotlight briefly returned to that one-time symbol of division in Europe, the Berlin wall . Even Mikhail Gorbachev attended the festivities on November 9, a spectacle of lights, balloons and emotions . Twenty-five years after its fall, the Berlin wall is one of the world's most heavily memorialised sites, a tourist attraction like few other 20th century structures . But while the wall remains the symbol of the Cold War in schoolbooks, op-eds and emotive speeches , it is also a highly problematic one . Rather than representing the threat of mutual nuclear annihilation, it always stood for a much simpler lesson - that of the West's moral victory over the \"prison\" of real existing socialism . If we want to understand the Cold War in all its self-destructiveness , we need to look elsewhere . A visitor to villages that lie near nuclear weapons storage sites in Europe might be surprised to be greeted by American flags in shop windows and front gardens . This form of identification with US nuclear weapons is puzzling given that these sites would be primary targets in the event of a nuclear war with Moscow . The West is currently too preoccupied with Russia's new nuclear militarism to notice the way that its own military alliance functions as an agent of regional insecurity . Lest we forget , NATO never abandoned its \"first use\" doctrine . It does not rule out the possibility of being first to go nuclear in an armed conflict with another nuclear power . Some will argue that \"now is not the time\" to start a public debate on NATO's tactical nukes , but even these critics would have to concede that the modernisation of the B61 further compromises the West's position in the 2015 revision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . If a new arms race is to be prevented in its infancy , the sleeping dog might have to learn to bark and bite again .",

            "input": "New Congress: My fellow Republicans, here's your chance to prove you can lead. This week marks a new era in American government . For the first time in the six years of the Obama administration, Republicans took the reins of power in both houses of Congress, bringing divided government to our nation's capital . With this new power comes not only responsibility, but also real challenges and opportunities . Yes, the newly empowered Republicans in the Senate have the ability to control the floor and try to break through some of the gridlock and dysfunction associated with the failed tenure of now Minority Leader Harry Reid . Instead of bottling up all the legislation that's been passed by the GOP House without ever letting it see the light of day, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can start moving things forward with up or down votes and a full, fair and thorough amendment process . He has pledged to get back to regular order and help re-establish trust between the American people and Congress . But even more importantly, the Senate can get to work on the issues of real importance to the people who elected them . Instead of pushing petty, politically motivated bills, or not voting just to protect one of the Democratic members from taking a tough vote, the Senate can focus on things that will have a direct impact on the American people . I am encouraged to see that the Keystone XL Pipeline is on the top of the docket . This common-sense, environmentally sound project will not only create good-paying jobs for both unions and non-union members, it will also increase our domestic supply of oil, helping to keep prices low and more money in people's pockets , and it will help to reduce the influence of foreign governments . It's unfortunate that President Obama continues to impede progress on Keystone and is standing with the radical fringe of his party rather than the overwhelming majority of the country . Likewise , now that the elections for leadership are over, House Speaker John Boehner needs to move immediately to unite his caucus and focus on the overwhelming areas of agreement within the GOP . Given that Republicans now boast their largest House majority since the late 1920s, it's not surprising that there have been, and will be, minor areas of difference within the caucus . But the things that unite us are so much more plentiful , and it's now the job of Speaker Boehner to focus on these issues . I was heartened to see the House Republicans roll out a series of bipartisan jobs bills this week, including legislation called the \"Hire More Heroes Act.\" This bill would exempt veterans already enrolled in health care plans from the VA or Department of Defense from counting toward the employer mandate under ObamaCare . This is a win-win for both veterans and small businesses . Many businesses are not hiring because of ObamaCare's many mandates and new regulations , and this measure would be a good first step to help alleviate that problem . Above all ,  Republicans in Congress have to prove to the American people that they are responsible leaders who will put our country's interests first by being able to lead and get real results . They need to show that they have learned from the mistakes of the past and will stop lurching from cliff to cliff and forcing self-imposed government shutdowns that only tarnish the GOP brand and make it harder to win future elections . The new Republican Congress needs to make it impossible for the Democrats to falsely portray the Grand Old Party as a group of fire-breathing extremists focused on divisive social issues . History tells us that when we focus on the issues that really matter-- such as low taxes, getting our debt and deficit under control, limited government, returning power to the states and a strong and muscular national defense-- the American people are with us , and we win elections as a result . The simple reality is that even with a GOP Senate, there is only so much of President Obama's destructive agenda that we can work on repealing these next two years . Getting rid of ObamaCare and rolling back his overreaching executive orders and memos-- that's not going to happen if a Democratic president succeeds the current occupant in January 2017 . We Republicans have a slew of talented candidates who, over the next few months, will throw their hats into the ring and begin the process of running for the White House . The new GOP Congress needs to make sure it provides critical support and issue-oriented ammunition for our nominees -- not become unwelcome distractions that will hurt the brand and increase the Democrats' chances of retaining the White House . Let's make these next two years count, so that in January of 2017 a newly elected Republican president can take power with robust GOP majorities in Congress and really get this country back on the right path .",

The now-consumed 2014 has been perfectly described by some commentators as the year when facts died . Politicians, mobs in the streets and their willing accomplices in the media swamped us with lies, obfuscations or riots manifest because, as author Thomas Sowell has noted,\"What matters today is how well you can concoct a story that fits people's preconceptions and arouses their emotions. Politicians like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, professional demagogues like Al Sharpton and innumerable irresponsible people in the media have shown that they have great talent in promoting a lynch mob.\" None of this is unique to 2014, however, nor is the aptitude to stir up a lynch mob the exclusive purview of politicians . It has been both the vocation and avocation of liberal media darlings for a very long time . In 2014, with almost perfect timing and illustrating the farce of the left, a liberal favorite -- New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd -- was exposed by the Sony email hack for just how much hypocrisy and contrivance rules her world . An Internet search of Ms  Dowd brings up a whole host of approving profiles and interviews over the years, with a particular column considered by her sycophants as one of her greatest accomplishments: the \"takedown\" of former New York Times investigative reporter Judith Miller . Ms  Dowd provided what many thought was the coup de grace against Ms  Miller when she wrote that column about her then-colleague at The New York Times, excoriating Ms  Miller for her coverage of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction WMD) leading up to the Iraq war . Ms  Miller, you see, had done the unthinkable . She reported what her investigation found on the issue , which also happened to be what the Bush administration and scores of other governments had also determined : Saddam was pursuing a WMD program and an untold number of those weapons were developed and undeclared . As her fellow liberal colleagues piled on Ms  Miller , Ms  Dowd's column, dripping in ridicule and moral authority, condemned the reporter for being a \"stenographer\" for the Bush administration . Ms  Dowd complained Ms  Miller's work\"fit too perfectly\" with what the White House had been asserting about WMD . In other words ,  Ms  Dowd accused Ms  Miller of being too close to her subject , essentially of colluding with others, of selling out to make someone happy or to further a shared agenda . It was absurd and petty . But what we didn't know at the time was that it was also a perfect case of projection . In emails revealed late last year by the Sony Pictures hack, Ms  Dowd, The New York Times' supposed paragon of journalistic ethics, was discovered to have assured a Sony executive that she would be sure to make her \"look great\" in a column, and appeared to promise to show the column to the executive's husband, a former Times reporter, beforehand . After the column ran, more emails were exchanged, with Ms  Dowd telling the executive,\"I hope you're happy... let's do another.\" After her subject declared the columnist her \"favorite person,\" Ms  Dowd gushed,\"You're mine! You're amazing.\" Ms  Dowd has since denied that she provided the column in advance . That's possible . So was it a draft that was provided? And by someone other than herself? For those who might suggest this mistake of Ms Dowd's was a one-off, issues of character inform everything we do . Hypocrisy doesn't sneak up on you once . It's part of how you relate to the world . Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times from 2003 to 2011, confirmed to the left-wing blog Media Matters in 2011 that the newspaper's treatment of Ms  Miller was due to politics and to assuage the leftist critics . Mr  Keller confessed,\"I let a year go by when a lot of people, particularly people on the left, became disenchanted with the Times because they saw it as having been cheerleaders for the war. I think I could have saved the paper a lot of trouble and some damage by dealing with [Ms  Miller's reporting] much sooner.\" Facts do tend to be pesky things, as Ms  Dowd and the rest of The New York Times crew found in 2014 . After years of morally superior, self-righteous preening, they had a problem : Judith Miller was proven right about WMD in Iraq . Revealed in a 2010 Wikileaks document dump, The New York Times finally wrote a 10,000 word story on \"abandoned chemical weapons\" in Iraq as it became evident our troops continued to be injured by them and their existence could no longer be denied . The New York Sun suggested the Times' story be viewed as \"journalism's longest correction,\" and was \"designed to try to extricate the Gray Lady from all these charges about how President George W  Bush and his camarilla lied about the danger of Saddam's chemical arsenal . It turns out that Iraq was littered with thousands of shells containing poison gas, like Sarin.\" In that 2005 column attacking Ms  Miller, Ms  Dowd dramatically warned her readers if Ms  Miller remained a reporter at The New York Times, the newspaper itself would be at risk . Ten years later, now with the Times on the verge of collapse, forced retirements, layoffs and plunging ad revenue, the facts are teaching a lesson in irony and hypocrisy to Ms  Dowd and everyone else at the Times who jettisoned the truth to soothe jealousies and pander to politics .",

            "input": "NFL 2015: Why I hope Ray Rice gets back into the game. Last year NFL star Ray Rice committed a single act of unforgettable and inexcusable violence against then fiancee Janay Palmer . This year he and his now wife Janay hope he will be back in the NFL, a platform he has used to aggressively combat adolescent bullying in the past . As the founder of an anti-bullying organization, I hope he gets a second chance and continues his anti-bullying crusade this year, and for many years to come . The couple is infamous for what went down in a New Jersey casino elevator , where Ray knocked Janay out with one left-handed strike, leading to his arrest on assault charges . Rice was later cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended by the NFL . He won his appeal and is now clear to play , if a team will have him . The couple's botched press conference in May, where he failed to publicly apologize to Janay, led many to condemn him further . Fox Sports wrote,\"Most of what(Ray Rice) said left the public and media shaking their heads.\" I met with Ray the day before that botched press conference while working at the Raven's training camp to help rookies and free agents better handle experiences with high school and college bullying . I encouraged him, when the time was right, to continue his anti-bullying crusade . His eyes watered because he deeply wants to be a hero to children again . Why would an anti-bullying advocate want Rice to have a second chance and to stay in the anti-bullying game under the right circumstances? Because Ray's deplorable but isolated act does not come close to the damage caused by bullying , and it doesn't make him a bully . We need more people like him who, once amends are made, to combat what is now the #1 form of child abuse in America . Rice is even willing to get political to fight bullying . He supported \"Grace's Law,\" a landmark, anti-cyberbullying law passed in Maryland . \"I truly hope that he continues his anti-bullying work,\" says Christine McComas, mother of the late Grace McComas, 15 , whose suicide is attributed to cyberbullying . \"His help was probably the single biggest factor that led to the new anti-cyberbullying law named after our daughter, which has already saved lives. His empathy and support of our family in our worst hour will never be forgotten. I have four daughters, so I'm sensitive to domestic violence. I have no reason to believe he is a serial abuser, and think he should be given the chance to redeem himself. Maryland owes a lot to that man.\" Also, people within the Ravens organization who knew Ray well told me that what happened in that elevator was inexcusable, yet also did not define Ray's real character . Matt Lauer of the TODAY Show, while interviewing Janay, said he received numerous phone calls from people who know Ray personally . They also said that what happened in that elevator was an aberration from his usually strong character . Rice is guilty of a single act of inexcusable violence ; an act Janay says didn't happen before and hasn't happened since that fateful day . By contrast, most acts of bullying are premeditated, and don't stem from flashes of anger but rather contempt and disdain toward a target . Bullies, including domestic abusers, wed power to fear as part of a psychological campaign of cruelty in order to dominate, control, intimidate and isolate another . Yet Janay says Ray's behavior before or after this one event includes none of this . In nearly a year since the punch felt around the NFL, not one woman has come forward to accuse Rice of similar abuse . This supports Janay's statement that what happened was an isolated incident , something Janay said during her TODAY Show interview with Matt Lauer . According to Janay, good may come from this single and deplorable act . She told Lauer that though the claims of serial abuse are false,\"God chose us for a reason.\" The couple also says that this incident, which pushed Ray into mandatory and intense counseling, made them better people, including how it compelled them to rededicate themselves to their Christian faith . If we can't give the Rice family the benefit of the doubt , then let's give them the benefit of time this new year , which will tell us whether he has truly seen the light . I believe that time will do more than tell . I believe it's on his side in 2015 . Paul Coughlin is an expert witness regarding bullying and the law, a former newspaper editor and is the author of numerous books, including Raising Bully- Proof Kids . He is the Founder of The Protectors: Freedom From Bullying--Courage, Character & Leadership for Life , which provides a comprehensive and community-wide solution to adolescent bullying in schools, summer camps, faith-based organizations, and other places where bullying can be prevalent .",

            "input": "Nigeria's old impeachment games. Recently the former president labelled many Nigerian federal legislators as thieves and looters . According to him, they indulge in extorting money from departments, contractors and ministries . \"When the guard is the thief,\" Obasanjo lamented,\" only God can keep the house safe and secure.\" With what is presently playing out at the National Assembly of Nigeria, Obasanjo may be right after all . Currently, some lawmakers are purportedly plotting to remove President Goodluck Jonathan from office . About 65 out of 109 Senators are reportedly involved in the plot . These anti-Jonathan lawmakers have told whoever cared to listen that they would table the president's sins on December 16, 2014 when they reconvene from their current recess . Chief among the president's reported sins are failure to contain the raging insurgency in the north; refusal to sign some bills; and alleged unauthorised expenditure of 1.7 trillion Naira (about $9.5bn) on the oil subsidy fund in 2011 . True, the security situation in the country is not palatable , but it has always been so since 2009 when Boko Haram started its violent uprising . No doubt, the president needs to demonstrate that he is capable of putting the terrorists to rout . But then , why are the senators just waking up to the existential realities in Nigeria? Why are they just discovering that the president spent more than what was approved for the oil subsidy fund in 2011? The point is, the lawmakers desperately need financial and political support to pursue their campaigns for the general elections coming up in February 2015 . And the best way to get this, I suspect, is to blackmail the president with impeachment or removal . In a bid to retain his seat, the president is supposed to calm them down by greasing their palms and supporting their bids for re-election . For many Nigerians, the legislators are actually acting true to type . In August 2002, when the nation was preparing for the 2003 general elections, the National Assembly waved the impeachment flag against the then President Obasanjo . The lower chamber, the House of Representatives, gave the him an ultimatum to resign within two weeks or be removed . They accused Obasanjo of incompetence and abuse of office . At the end of the day, the so-called impeachment turned out to be a storm in a teacup . It has become a tradition that whenever the lawmakers want anything done in their favour, they arm-twist the executive with threats of probes or impeachment . But most of the probes end up an exercise in futility . Nobody is punished . No credible result is released . In 2009, the then Special Adviser on Petroleum to the president, Dr Emmanuel Egbogah, alleged that oil companies took some senators to Ghana to feed and bribe them to oppose the oil and gas reforms being initiated by the federal government . Naturally, the senators were angry . They called for a probe of the allegations . Senate President David Mark thundered then,\"There is going to be a serious public hearing... because when people begin to beckon at their whims and caprices to label us in the way they want, we should take it seriously.\" Nothing concrete came out of this . There was also a probe of the power sector reforms undertaken by the then President Olusegun Obasanjo . The Ndudi Elumelu-led committee of the House of Representatives that probed the rot in the power sector spent millions of Naira in the course of conducting their investigations . They turned in many volumes of the report on the probe . At the end, the House set up an ad hoc committee to review the report . Of course ,  the review committee dropped the probe report . It reportedly accused the Elumelu panel of lacking understanding of the nature of power sector contracts . Hence ,  it exonerated the Obasanjo-led government of mismanaging funds for power projects . The rot in this power sector is still haunting Nigerians up until today . Undoubtedly, our lawmakers are incurable lawbreakers . Sometimes, they engage in physical combat in the chambers . Sometimes, their unruly behaviour leaves even children wondering why such supposedly mature individuals have become soup-guzzling elders . They collect jumbo pay only to pass a few bills and devote most of their time in shadow-boxing . A good number of these legislators, for instance, never sponsored any bill since they were elected . Some care less about the interest of their constituents and don't report back to them . They have also failed in their oversight of ministries and government agencies . The House has committees in charge of different government ministries . But what some members of these committees do, sometimes, is to demand monetary inducement to pass the budget of these ministries . In fact ,  money is the name of the game . Last year, The Economist of London reported that Nigerian legislators were about the highest paid in the world . According to the newspaper, with the basic salary of $189,500 per annum, the Nigerian legislator earns 116 times the country's Gross Domestic Product per capita of $1,600 . Still ,  many of the legislators frequently agitate for increase in their already bloated salaries and allowances . For instance ,  in 2010, some members of the House of Representatives, not satisfied with their personal quarterly allocation of 27.2 million Naira ($153,000), wanted their quarterly allocation increased to 42 million Naira ($234,000) for each of them . The budget of the House could not accommodate it then . Hence ,  the lawmakers reportedly suggested collapsing the capital budget of the House to take care of their request . It would serve the Nigerian nation better if the job of the lawmakers is on a part-time basis and their salaries are drastically cut . That way, many of them will not find it attractive to contest the position for the sake of the lucrative pay, not to mention thinking of issuing threats they will never carry through .",

            "input": "North Korea: An 'act of war' over a movie? At his press conference on Friday, President Barack Obama said that Sony \"made a mistake\" by not releasing its film \"The Interview\" on schedule . He said:\"We cannot have a society in which some dictator some place can start imposing censorship here in the United States.\" The dictator in question is North Korea's Kim Jung-un . Sony acted following both a major hack of its computer files and, more ominously, a threat that any US showing of the comedy film that culminates in the assassination of Kim, could produce another 9/11 type attack . The threat was issued on December 16 by an outfit calling itself, the \"Guardians of Peace\" , which also claims to have been behind the hack attack on Sony . It promised a \"Christmas gift\" for the American people . Within 48 hours of the threat, and following pleas by companies owning most of the cinemas in the US, as well as by the shopping centres in which the cinemas are situated, Sony pulled the film , which is quite a coup for whoever orchestrated the assault on the company . The original hack cost Sony an estimated $170m while withdrawing the film will cost the company another $45m it cost to make plus whatever the film would have taken in at theatres and from home release . This is a big deal . It is worth noting that it is not 100 percent positive that Pyongyang is behind the Sony hack or the 9/11 warning . Yes, the FBI asserts (with its customary assurance) that North Korea is guilty on both counts but leading cyber security experts say (with equal certitude) that the evidence of North Korean responsibility is sketchy at best . As for the North Korean regime itself, it flatly denies any involvement while at the same time issuing threats against the US that are even more blood curdling than the one issued by the \"Guardians of Peace\" (who may or may not be the North Koreans themselves) . Whoever the culprits are, they did not inflict major damage on the US . Contrary to those who are screaming that by pulling the film, the US surrendered the concept of freedom of speech , it is not the US government that pulled the film . In fact ,  Obama said that if Sony had talked to him first, he would have told the company to show the film as planned . But Sony did not talk to Obama because its decision to withdraw the film had nothing to do with the US or its national interests but with the financial interests of the multinational corporation itself . Multinationals do not, for reasons implied in the very term multinational, act with an eye on any flag . These are businesses and profit, not patriotism, is their guide . It is, therefore, ridiculous to accuse the US of yielding to the threat of a foreign dictator . It didn't . Sony did and , from the point of view of its shareholders, it probably did the right thing . Losing $45m in production costs for \"The Interview\" is nothing compared to Sony's potential liability if some catastrophe occurred at a showing of the film in Los Angeles or Washington, DC . This is not to say that there are no foreign policy implications of this debacle . Sony's decision to make a comedy about the assassination of the North Korean head of state was a terrible idea that has only worsened the US' already terrible relations with this very unstable nuclear-armed nation . If reports that a State Department official read the script and approved of the assassination scenario are true , that is troubling . Driving an already unbalanced head of state off the deep end is clearly not something diplomats should sign off on . Of course ,  certain elements in the US government want to see an increase in tensions with North Korea, and maybe even an attempt at \"regime change\" . Although Obama was careful to say that North Korea's purported actions constituted \"cyber vandalism\" but \"not an act of war\" , Senator John McCain, who becomes chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee next month, said on Friday that it is indeed an act of war to which the US must respond . Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich agrees , as do eager warriors in both political parties, those who promoted war with Iraq and now oppose a nuclear deal with Iran . Those two countries are, of course, charter members of former President George W Bush's original \"Axis of Evil\" regimes that he and his allies wanted eliminated . The third member was North Korea .",

The holiday headlines blared without a hint of distrust:\"End of War\" and \"Mission Ends\" and \"U.S  formally ends the war in Afghanistan\", as the US government and Nato celebrated the alleged end of the longest war in American history . Great news! Except, that is, when you read past the first paragraph : \"the fighting is as intense as it has ever been since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001,\" according to the Wall Street Journal . And about 10,000 troops will remain there for the foreseeable future (more than we had a year after the Afghan war started) . Oh, and they'll continue to engage in combat regularly . But other than that, yeah, the war is definitely over . This is the new reality of war : As long as the White House doesn't admit the United States is at war , we're all supposed to pretend as if that's true . This ruse is not just the work of the president . Members of Congress, who return to work this week, are just as guilty as Barack Obama in letting the public think we're Definitely Not at War, from Afghanistan and Somalia to the new war with Isis in Iraq and Syria and beyond . Thirteen years on, the near limitless war authorization Congress passed for the Afghanistan war remains in place, with no sign that Congress wants to even debate revoking it . This is what will allow US troops to continue fighting, despite the mission supposedly being \"formally\" over . Just a month before Obama made his farcical announcement last week , he signed a secret order to ensure US troops continue to engage in combat missions against various \"militant groups\" in Afghanistan for all of 2015 . The war in Afghanistan is over, the President says . The sky is green, the President says . The sun rises in the West, the President says . Another place the United States is Definitely Not at War? Pakistan, where, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the US conducted multiple drone strikes between Christmas and New Year's Eve, killing at least nine people . We don't know who died , but the Associated Press assured us they were \"militants\", despite the US government's definition of \"militant\" having been manipulated beyond comprehension . The US Congress, of course, has steadfastly refused to attempt to place any real legislative limits on drone strikes, even those that have killed American citizens - which, as various scholars have been screaming for years, represent an unconstitutional violation of the Fifth Amendment . Meanwhile, the Defense Department quietly announced a few days before Christmas that, later this month, another 1,300 troops will deploy to Iraq in its ever-expanding undeclared war on Isis . A Pentagon spokesperson emphasized these are Definitely Not Combat Troops, despite the US government's current definition of \"combat\" being so narrow that it's \"rejected by virtually every military expert\"  - not to mention that the troops already in Iraq are already under \"regular\" fire, according to CNN . The US continues to launch airstrikes against Isis and various other groups in Syria as well . As the new Congress opens in Washington on Tuesday, it once again has the opportunity to formally debate and actually vote on the war against Isis, a constitutional obligation from which America's politicians shamefully slunk away , preferring instead to campaign for re-election - free of difficult decision-making . Now , almost five months in to a war the administration freely admits will last for years if not decades, hardly anyone seems to care what legal experts across the political spectrum believe : this war is without precedent - and it's illegal without Congressional approval . Now ,  the US Congress is not exactly a body known for its nuance and restraint , and there are many reasons why war against Isis remains a terrible idea , but if either the Republican-controlled House and Senate want to make an actual case for war , then that is their prerogative . But vote on it . Because the Obama administration has already gone down a dangerous path wherein the executive branch can unilaterally carry out virtually any war it wants without any official input from Congress . Given the GOP's newfound hatred of executive power, which the party seem to have conveniently forgotten was pioneered during every Republican administration since Nixon , you'd think Washington's new majority might want to take this tiny step of debating and voting on the Isis war , as is their own constitutional duty . Republicans would do well to use the president's own words against him . As Barack Obama himself told the Boston Globe back in 2007 :. The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation . Since virtually the entire US intelligence community agrees that Isis, no matter how awful and heinous the group may be, does not imminently threaten the mainland United States , maybe Congress can start off the new year by doing its job and actually voting on something required of them months ago .",

Health care -- done . Amnesty for illegal immigrants  -- done . Cuba -- next . This last one also has the added bonus point that it puts him right with the international left , which lionizes Castro . And the president will go on picking off the next items on the bucket list for the next two years of his term unless Congress decides to stop him . Should they work up the gumption , lawmakers will find they can do many things to stand up for the prerogatives of the legislative branch . Obviously, the release of the 65-year-old American hostage Alan Gross should be welcome . His \"crime\" was to bring computers to Jews on the island . For the last five years, he has been a victim of Cuba's state terrorism , just as 11 million Cubans have been held hostage by their government for the past five decades . Exchanging three hardened Cuban spies for Gross, however ,  establishes an insulting moral and legal equivalency . The spies actions led to the death of an American in the 1990s , and they were duly convicted . Their release in exchange for Gross creates an incentive for rogue regimes and individual actors to kidnap Americans all over the world . Not only does President Obama's action fail to advance freedom in Cuba , it throws a lifeline to Cuba's dictators , whose current supplier of funds, Venezuela, is on the ropes because of plunging oil prices . It surrenders to the demands for normalization that the Castros have been making for decades . So what can Congress do? Right off the bat, Congress must make it crystal clear to President Obama that he lacks the authority to lift the embargo on Cuba, allow trade to take place between the two nations, let tourists to go to Cuba to bail out the regime or give Cuba have access to capital markets . U.S  law--the Helms-Burton Act of 1996--gives the Congress power to override any action taken by the executive to lift the embargo . In order to lift the embargo, the Cuban government would have to give the Cuban people a number of rights--of association, speech, political activity, etc  -- that President Obama obviously failed to secure in his 45-minute conversation with Cuban dictator Raul Castro Tuesday . Congress can also make clear to the president that there are statutory criteria that must be met before his administration can take Cuba off the State Department list of terrorism sponsors . The president must inform Congress that there has been a change of leadership and policies of the Cuban government and that Castro has given assurances that it will no longer support terrorist acts . Can President Obama do any of that? Senators should also make clear that they will put a hold on any ambassador that Mr  Obama nominates to serve in Cuba unless he can guarantee that the Cuban government is no longer a threat to the United States and has decided to grant freedom to people in Cuba . Sen  Marco Rubio, R-Fla , has already said he plans to do that . Additionally ,  Congress can look into the possibility of using policy riders in the upcoming DHS appropriations debate in February and the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations process to deny the president funds for setting up relations . Congress must act because President Obama has been completely feckless in his entire approach to Cuba . He received nothing in exchange for many substantial concessions made to the Communist regime . After five years of \"negotiations\" President Obama ended exactly where Raul Castro's demands began five years ago . As Senator Marco Rubio said, President \"Obama is the worst negotiator since Carter.\" Mr  Obama's statement was filled with Havana's communist talking points, such as affirming that Cubans are poor and unfree because of the embargo, or that Cuba was a U.S  colony . None of that is true , and yet Mr  Obama said it . Congress must act to limit the damage inherent in this Havana Giveaway . Left unchecked , Obama will simply move on to the next misguided item on his bucket list .",

U.S  President Barack Obama departs at the conclusion of his end of the year press conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington, December 19, 2014 . Obama and his family plan to depart Washington later in the day to spend the holidays in Hawaii . REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR4IQRC . U.S  President Barack Obama speaks on the phone with Jordan's King Abdullah at the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, August 8, 2014 . REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR41Q8N . Editor's note: The following article originally appeared in The Hill and on TheHill.com website . Dan Pfeiffer's office is next to the Oval Office . The cheek-by-jowl location reflects the importance of his job as senior adviser guiding President Obama's image and message going into his final two years in the White House . At the moment, the president and Pfeiffer are on a hot streak . Polls show Obama's approval numbers climbing . \"It's an 18-point gap [better than] Bush and the same as Reagan's,\" Pfeiffer said, comparing Obama's current approval rating to that of President George W  Bush and President Reagan at the equivalent point in their second terms . Strong public support is central to the president's strategy of keeping the loyalty of Senate Democrats . If large numbers of Democrats in Congress run away from a president with bad poll numbers , Republicans can put the president on the defensive for the remainder of his time in office . Major defections by Senate Democrats will also allow the Republican majority in the Senate to stop filibusters and potentially override Obama's vetoes . The issues at stake range from construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to efforts to change and repeal Obamacare, as well as undo immigration reform, financial regulation, the opening of new relations with Cuba and new limits on greenhouse gases . Pfeiffer does not see any issue where Republicans can expect to undo a presidential veto: \"Not one,\" he emphasized . The Keystone XL pipeline is the one instance in which Pfeiffer acknowledges that veto may have to be used in the first place . But he does not expect such a move to hurt the president's revival in the polls . It is an issue, Pfeiffer argued, often cited by Republicans who don't like the president anyway . But most \"people don't have super-strong feelings about it,\" he said . \"They are not energized about it, especially at a time of low gas prices.[Polls show] people generally prefer it but this is not a huge issue in their lives.\" Pfeiffer also expects constant fights with Republicans on Capitol Hill over the Environmental Protection Agency's use of the Clean Air Act to better regulate greenhouse gas emissions . \"The Republican policy is wrong,\" he said.\"I feel good about our chances [because] people feel strongly about clean air and clean water.\" With his current good poll numbers, the president is able to go on a political offensive despite taking a beating in last fall's midterms and ceding control of the Senate, as well as the House, to Republicans . Pfeiffer ties the president's rising popularity to the success of his economic policies but also to the Republican Party's difficulties with any voter not in the Koch brothers' tax bracket . \"The GOP has huge trouble on cultural affinity,\" said Pfeiffer . \"Republican tax policies, opposition to regulating pollution, their effort to repeal Dodd- Frank - it all favors the rich... We need to engage them on all that.\" \"Engage them\" is the idea at the heart of the president's plan for his last two years . The GOP is on defense as it responds to proposals increasing access to community college as well as increased tax breaks for families in need of childcare and with two working spouses . Pfeiffer starts looking around his office for a card recently given to senior staff that reminds them they are in \"the Fourth Quarter.\" The quote comes from Obama . Pfeiffer tells the story of the president looking at Green Bay Packers' player Randall Cobb during a rally in Wisconsin and making the case that fourth quarter football is\"when big things happen.\" In a moment of off-script pique during last week's State of the Union address, the president reminded Republicans he cannot run for election again because he already beat them in two presidential elections . That confidence leads him to conclude that losing control of the Senate in the midterms is only a momentary set back in the big picture -- the total game and the legacy of the Obama presidency . As Pfeiffer told the New York Times in advance of the State of the Union speech, the nation's economic resurgence under President Obama creates \"a Chicken Little problem [for Republicans]-- all the doom and gloom they predicted did not come to pass.\" The president crowed about \"good news, people\" in the State of the Union speech : He listed 11 million jobs created by American business in the last five years; more people with health insurance; cuts in the deficit; record stock prices; higher high school graduation rates and lower gas prices, as evidence of his success . \"At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits,\" the president said . \".... So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works... and these polices will continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way.\" Pfeiffer and other top administration officials think they can further improve their poll numbers by getting Republicans to debate the president's new proposals for increasing wages for working Americans . Good news in foreign policy is also possible but , unlike most second-term presidents, Obama is not abandoning the domestic agenda . Obama's poll numbers will not decide the 2016 race for the White House, Pfeiffer said, because the \"biggest factor is the popularity of the nominee.\" But good polls will prevent Democrats from\"distancing\" themselves from Hillary Clinton, Sen  Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) or another other nominee, and lead to better turnout . That is also part of the Obama team's fourth quarter plan to end the game as winners .",

            "input": "Obama's big government policies don't create enough decent jobs. Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report the economy added about 230,000 jobs in November , and the White House will tout the economic recovery has created jobs for a record 57 months in a row . Voters rejected that message by ousting Democrats in the mid-term elections , quite simply because the President's recovery has simply not delivered enough good paying, full time jobs . In the wake of the financial crisis, unemployment peaked at 10 percent , but the five year recovery has scored only 2.3 percent annual growth and added only about 10 million jobs--a mere 7 percent increase from the recession low of 129 million . President Reagan also inherited a mess--high oil prices, double digit interest rates and unemployment peaking at 10.8 percent . His recovery, over the period comparable to the Obama expansion, registered 4.8 percent annual GDP growth and created 14.3 million jobs--a 16 percent increase from a recession low of 89 million . The difference was governing philosophy . Obama put billions into cumbersome, economically questionable government programs like solar energy, expanded federal entitlements, imposed higher taxes on small entrepreneurs, and burdened businesses and banks with costly and ineffective regulations . Manufacturing and construction--hamstrung by onerous new restrictions on factories and bank lending--have not adequately recovered . Today, both industries employ about 1.6 million fewer workers than before the recession . Lost are many jobs paying more than $25 per hour that once helped undergird the middle class . Democrats, such as Senator Charles Schumer blame new technologies and advocate yet more big government , but innovation that raises labor productivity has been a dominant force since the first axle and wheel , and Obama's failures indicate paucity of Schumer's prescription . More striking has been the failure of U.S  manufacturers to apply home-grown technologies to more effectively boost domestic manufacturing, increase exports and compete with imports . During the 2008 campaign, Obama promised to improve U.S  competitive performance by addressing China's undervalued currency , which artificially disadvantages U.S.-based factories, but hasn't . Since the Obama recovery began , the trade deficit with China has increased $190 billion, destroying 1.6 million American jobs . In addition to the Keystone pipeline, the Administration continues to block petroleum development off the Atlantic, Pacific and Eastern Gulf Coasts . The United States needlessly imports about 5.5 million barrels of petroleum each day at an annual cost of $120 billion a year . That kills another 1 million jobs a year in construction, petroleum refining, manufacturing, and professional services . Health benefits costs are about 50 percent higher for U.S  manufacturers than for competitors in Japan and Germany . Obama promised to do something about that too , but the Affordable Care Act mostly subsidizes health coverage for previously uninsured and lower income Americans . Premiums paid by businesses keep rising faster than inflation, further burdening U.S  competitiveness in international markets . High health care costs, coupled with slack in the jobs market, encourage employers to split full time positions into part-time jobs to avoid paying for health insurance and other benefits . Seven million Americans, who want full time employment, are consigned to part- time work--often in retailing and other lower paying service activities , where jobs are more easily divided among several workers . Workers in finance, technology and other high skilled professions are getting good raises , while wages for lower-skilled workers--especially those stuck in part-time positions--lag inflation . Combined with the shortage of mid-skilled jobs in construction and manufacturing, those forces have driven down median family income to $52,120 from about $56,436 prior to the recession . Families near the top have registered significant gains , while the majority of families have permanently lost much more buying power than those averages indicate . Getting America working and incomes rising again requires better managing globalization, freeing up U.S  energy production and smarter, lower-cost business regulations . Without pro-growth policies, the monthly jobs report will continue to bring depressing news to America's working families and lots of deceptive media hype from White House .",

Tuesday at President Obama's penultimate State of the Union address , when Obama points for effect at someone sitting with the First Lady as her guest , every single guest around her should be a family member of someone killed by a police officer . I want to see Michelle Obama sandwiched between Erica Garner - whose father, Eric Garner, was killed by an NYPD officer using an illegal chokehold- and Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister , who was tackled and shackled by police when trying to help her dying 12-year-old brother . I want to see Leslie McSpadden, Michael Brown's mother there tonight, and a relative of Tasha Thomas, John Crawford's now-deceased girlfriend , who was interrogated by the same police department who'd just killed the father of her children for shopping at Wal Mart . Let America look upon the elder Michael Brown, Kadiatou Diallo (Amadou Diallo's mother), Constance Malcolm (Ramarley Graham's mother), Sylvia Palmer (Akai Gurley's mother) or any of the thousands of relatives of the 1,100 or so Americans killed by police in 2014 . This of course will never happen , but it's what I want . President Obama should use the political theatre of his \"Skutniks\"- the humans used to give a face to presidential pet problems since Ronald Reagan invited Lenny Skutnik to the State of the Union in 1982 - to focus American's attention squarely on the loss of human life when cops kill black civilians . If President Obama wants us to believe that he thinks black life matters , it's not enough for him to form a task force on 21 century policing : task forces and commissions are where serious reforms go to be forgotten . One police shooting victim's family member up in his box with a nice cop like Richmond, California Police Chief Chris Magnus(who famously held up a #BlackLivesMatters sign) is not enough . We don't need a black kid-white cop hug moment . When the President paired up a black victim of racism with kindly white folks at his \"beer summit\" in 2009 it was a disaster - at best a distraction, and at worst a prevarication that racism is anecdotal and not systematic . If President Obama is serious about showing black and brown life matters in this country - he's made some progress showing this overseas by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, though not so much by employing drone warfare in Pakistan - he needs to go big at the State of the Union . He's taken on black lives falling victim to gun violence at his annual address before by inviting the parents of Hidaya Pendleton, a black Chicago teenager who was killed in 2013 shortly after performing at Obama's second inaugural . But as Commander in Chief, with all those black folks at his side, Obama could challenge the mortal violence the state itself wages against its citizens through the local police and say to them: Enough . Ronald Reagan, whom Barack Obama uses as an example for how to sell himself as president, used Lenny Skutnik as an example of how\"we saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest,\" after Skutnik jumped into icy water of the Potomac River to help the drowning after a plane crash . But are not the kin of those killed by police violence also displaying \"American heroism at its finest\" in helping those who can't breathe? It is women like Tawanda Jones who are creating a more perfect union when she boldly speaks out about her brother being killed by police - even when dissent is under attack and Fox News broadcasts lies about her . When Erica Garner visits the site where two NYPD cops were killed to offer her condolences, she is saving the union . Every time a woman like Michael Brown's mother calls for non-violence - when she could instead, understandably, lash out with a fraction of the hatred which killed her son- she is keeping the nation from ripping itself apart and acting with the kind of American heroism that presidents should applaud loudly and publicly . Skutnik helped save one woman . The black women who bury their sons and husbands and seek to change the systems that caused their deaths may save countless of lives - and maybe even the soul of the nation . The Black Lives Matters movement is a testament that, once again, black Americans are being called upon to force all Americans to examine our addiction to the violence and militarism that oppresses everyone in different ways . Our first black president, riding an 18 month approval rating high, could choose to do some of that himself tonight, by acknowledging those left behind when black lives are ended by the state and who still choose to use their grief to effect positive change .",

            "input": "Obama's State of the Union fantasy world: We need a real national security strategy, VA reform. Here's a prediction: expect a narrative to emerge in certain media outlets in the coming days that Tuesday night's State of the Union speech was a grand return to form for President Obama . The elite, east-coast intelligencia line will be that the beleaguered lame duck president--facing a hostile, conservative Congress--regained his momentum with renewed energy and purpose . How Obama Got His Groove Back , Washington- style . Groove aside , the fact remains that Obama's next-to-last State of the Union address did not substantially address two of the most pressing issues currently facing our nation and that matter most to its military veterans: the lack of a clear United States national security strategy-- to include the crisis facing our military-- and the inability of the VA bureaucracy care to deliver timely health care to millions of our veterans . But you wouldn't know it by listening to Tuesday night's State of the Union address . President Obama is living in a fantasy world . The president says that we're \"stopping ISIL's advance.\" But in reality, his campaign of airstrikes have not been successful , and ISIS controls more territory in Iraq and Syria today than ever before . He also boldly claimed that \"we're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need,\" but this statement too just doesn't match up with reality . Today, nearly 250,000 veterans are still stuck in the VA claims backlog and another 290,000 languish in the appeals process . Is that still \"too many,\" Mr  President? Unfortunate events will likely force the president's attention to these issues in 2015 -- just like ISIS did in Iraq and Phoenix did for the VA in 2014 . However ,  President Obama could be proactive and get ahead of these issues by pursuing the following four agenda items :. 1 \\. Articulate a real national security strategy . The president's plan for\"leading from behind\"-- and that national security and foreign policy boils down to \"don't do stupid stuff\"-- is no substitute for a real strategy, as deteriorating situations in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere prove . Likewise, denying the nature of the enemy we face(\"ISIS is not Islamic\") only muddies the water further , emboldening our enemies and confusing our allies . President Obama also touted ending the 14 year-long war in Afghanistan , but \"ending\" is different than\"winning.\" His telegraphed withdrawals have pulled us out of conflicts before they're resolved , creating power vacuums in Iraq- and soon in Afghanistan- that leave America more vulnerable . And incredibly, for the first time since 9/11, the president failed to even mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda  - both of which are far from \"on the run\" as he proclaimed in 2012 and are advancing and actively challenging the West . 2 \\. Get serious about fixing defense spending . Instead of cutting fat, the president's ill-conceived defense budget sequester has slashed into the muscle of our military force . The administration should strive to replace defense sequestration, by implementing serious and commensurate acquisitions and compensation reforms . Reforming these areas will reduce Pentagon budgetary pressures caused by massive weapons system cost-overruns and exploding personnel costs, allowing for a more strategic allocation of war-fighting resources . In order to live within a fiscally responsible reality, and most importantly maintain the world's most capable military, the administration and Congress must get serious about real DoD spending reform . His address last night didn't even mention sequestration . 3 \\. Develop and implement a plan to tackle the national debt . Respected military leaders like Marine General James Mattis, Admiral Mike Mullen, and many others recognize that the biggest long-term threat to our national security is our massive national debt . At more than $18 trillion and growing, the debt is on track to double under President Obama . It is absolutely vital to the fiscal, economic, and military strength of our country that we have a serious plan to get our debt under control through reductions in spending and significant reforms across the government . 4 \\. Implement more accountability and choice at the VA . The VA reforms passed by Congress last year were a good first step, but will not address the deeper, systemic culture problems at VA . In the next Congress, the president should champion even deeper reforms at VA to bring accountability for poor performing employees throughout the department and to expand health care options for veterans outside the VA system . These basic principles would not only address a campaign promise the president has failed to deliver on(\"fixing the VA\") but would show that he is finally serious about improving veterans' access to the quality health care they earned . What the president misses, and even defies, in his latest list of proposals is that Americans don't think government isn't doing enough . They think government does too much, that most of what it does, it does poorly , and that it doesn't attend to the issues that matter to them . Focusing on the four agenda items above would send a message that the president is finally serious about governing in his last two years in office . It's probably too much to ask for Obama to change his approach at this stage in his presidency -- but it's essential if he wants to avoid a legacy of division, defiance and neglect . And if the president continues on his current course? Well, the items listed above will become part of a compelling agenda for his potential successors as they take to the campaign trail for 2016 .",

            "input": "The Observer view on the Paris attacks. Last week's attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris and the subsequent, linked hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket were appalling acts of inhumanity that should be universally condemned . Despite the killers' grandiose claim to be \"defenders of the prophet\", their actions amounted to cold-blooded murder of defenceless people . Their pre-planned purpose was to terrorise, divide and dismay . Their aim was cowardly, contemptible and cruel . The perpetrators deserve only ignominy and the bitter scorn of the world . The attacks should be understood, more broadly, as a crude attempt to stifle a publication and its journalists who exercised, in vivid, unapologetic terms, the fundamental, priceless right to freedom of speech and expression . This right, though never absolute, was established through centuries of struggle and is still far from fully accepted around the world . There are many others - governments, dictators, religious fanatics - who would also like to shoot it down . That the killers' made Jews their additional, parallel target lends a woefully familiar, disgustingly antisemitic twist to a three-day trail of carnage and grief . By so doing, they hoped yet another community would be left in fear . This attack was thus also an attack on the French nation as a whole, on the values and beliefs that have sustained it, and on the message of liberty, equality and fraternity it has unevenly but persistently propagated . And while its principal victims were irreverent secularists , it was also an attack on faith - an offence against moral as well as human law . It was an attack on the life spiritual itself, whether conducted through church, mosque, synagogue or personal observance. It was an act of utter godlessness . By attempting to murder love with fear, to kill laughter with hatred, to substitute inflexible dogmas for shared truths, the masked gunmen attacked us all , European, American and Arab, Muslim, Christian and Jew, black, brown and white alike . In doing so, they posed a vital question . How, in the face of this assault on our common home, our common humanity, do we respond? Do we meet terror with a greater terror of our own or do we seek another way? Shall we unite together or shall we give in to division, discrimination and distrust? In Paris, and in other cities around the world, a spontaneous reply has already been given . The marchers, demonstrators, office workers, journalists, bloggers, politicians and governments who declared, with one voice:\"Je suis Charlie\", sent an immediate, welcome message of solidarity and defiance . Today, this roar of courage and belief will reach ear-splitting levels when people from every background join a march in Paris for unity, freedom and democracy . Out of blood and horror a unique moment has arisen, for France and all Europe . The choice is stark and unavoidable . It is between the ongoing struggle for enlightenment - Europe's gift to the world - and a gathering, hate-filled darkness . The evident danger is that this spirit of unity may not endure . French Muslim leaders have roundly condemned the attackers . \"These men are criminals... For me, they are not Muslims,\" said the imam of Drancy . But at less emotional moments, French Muslims also speak of routine, entrenched discrimination, of insensitive restrictions such as curbs on women wearing the veil, and of a French policy of assimilation and integration, the flipside of Britain's let- it-all-hang-out multiculturalism , which has failed to achieve equal rights and equal treatment . It is this same embattled Muslim community, fractured, underprivileged, marginalised and disrespected which produced the killers . It is clear, conversely, that many French people have a problem with Islam . According to an Ipsos survey last year, 63% of French voters said Islam was not compatible with French values . Almost three-quarters said Muslims wanted to impose their values on others . Surveys also suggest seven out of 10 voters believe sections of the immigrant community have failed to integrate over the past 30 years . Some 65% say immigration levels are out of control . Anti-Muslim and anti-immigration movements are growing in strength in Germany, Britain and across Europe . But France's already powerful far-right Front National is certain to use the Charlie Hebdo affair to exploit these fears and prejudices . The urgent, daunting challenge for President Francois Hollande's ruling socialists, and the centre-right of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, is to plot a different, more conciliatory path . Their task: to tap into this spirit of unity, forging a new reality for both majority and minority communities . Muslim world leaders can help halt the cycles of violence and confrontation , if they wish . But this common challenge will not be assisted by wrong-headed, kneejerk reactions by western security services . In France, there is justified criticism that the Kouachi brothers were not under close watch, given their past record of extremism . Yet it would be wrong to massively increase monitoring of the Muslim community , thereby exacerbating existing tensions . Much better to use any additional resources to engage, rather than confront , while focusing more exactly on identifying truly hardline fanatics . Similarly ,  calls for more cash to counter a mounting but undefined terrorist menace to Britain should be treated with both respect and circumspection . Andrew Parker, head of MI5, warned last week of the \"growing gap between the increasingly challenging threat and the decreasing availability of capabilities to address it\" . But extended, intrusive internet surveillance does not necessarily bring increased security . What it does do is potentially deal a further blow to personal liberty, including the ability to speak and communicate freely and openly . The response to the Charlie Hebdo killings, in the longer term, should also include wider acceptance of the proper limits to individual and social freedoms, including free speech . It is not acceptable, for example, to use racist terms to describe a different ethnic group . It is not acceptable to resort to stereotypes to vilify minorities or ,  say, members of the opposite sex . And it is sometimes not appropriate, nor particularly funny, to deliberately provoke Muslims by publishing cartoons of the prophet that they view as blasphemous, offensive and insulting . Having said that, individuals or groups should not seek to prevent or ban published material just because they do not like it, do not agree or do not get the joke . Even more so, the ridiculing of Islam, however much resented, cannot be used to justify or explain gross acts of violence . The freedom to speak, write, draw and laugh fearlessly, without censorship and unreasonable restraint, lies at the very heart of a tolerant, democratic and inclusive society .",

            "input": "The Observer view on our health and the sugar-peddling food industry. The London Eye, a landmark since the Millennium, welcomed the first day of a new sponsor yesterday . Coca-Cola plans to play \"an even greater part in future moments of happiness and celebration in the capital\", according to Jon Woods, general manager of Coca-Cola UK and Ireland . It's ironic that the arrival of the red and white trademark colours of a global drink renowned, in its original form, for providing a shocking nine spoonfuls of sugar per 330ml can, comes at the end of a week in which, as in every week, 500 children received hospital treatment for dental decay , and there have been a stream of warnings about the health of the nation . We are swallowing far more sugar, salt and fat than is good for us- or the public purse . One warning came last Thursday when On Rock or Sand: Firm Foundations for Britain's Future was published, edited by John Sentamu, archbishop of York . It tackles a range of issues spawned by a low-wage economy and refers to the current epidemic of obesity that, for the first time in many decades, means that some children may live shorter lives than their parents . On Rock or Sand rightly points out that \"choice\" in diet is complex . It is influenced by income, class, culture and societal pressure among myriad other drivers, not least the seductive practices of the marketplace in disguising what goes into processed food and employing the hard sell in honeyed words that are particularly effective on children . Low-cost food and medical progress have ensured longer lives but decades with a long-term condition can also bring misery . The book quotes Department of Health figures that show 62% of adults and 28% of children are overweight or obese . The health problems this spawns include type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease, between them costing NHS England more than? 5bn a year . Last Wednesday, Andy Burnham, Labour shadow health secretary, launched Labour's public health strategy . It served up even scarier statistics . Unless the rise in obesity is reversed , the cost to the NHS of diabetes alone will rise from ? 10bn a year to an unsustainable ? 17bn a year by 2035 . While the World Health Organisation recommends that 5% of our food energy should come from sugar , children are consuming triple that amount . Further bad news came from the Youth Sport Trust, in its Unlocking Potential report . Only 21% of boys and 16% of girls are exercising sufficiently . Physical education lessons have slumped below the miserly two hours a week set by the previous Labour government . The trust is rightly calling for five hours of physical activity a week in state schools to match that offered by private schools . Eating too much and doing too little may be a personal \"choice\" for some , but it's one the nation can ill-afford . So what's to be done? The first is to show common sense . It is incredible that Merlin Entertainments should consider Coca-Cola a suitable sponsor for the London Eye . As this paper reports, John Middleton, vice-president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, says:\"Coca-Cola is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and diabetes.\" The second imperative is for government to wake up to the scale of the health disaster on its doorstep . In February 2010, David Cameron laid out his vision for \"a new age of government\" . \"If you combine this very simple, very conservative thought - go with the grain of human nature- with all the advances in behavioural economics,\" he said,\"I think we can achieve a real increase in wellbeing... without necessarily having to spend a lot of money.\" Money has certainly been tight even as public health issues, supporting improved wellbeing, have disastrously dropped off the agenda, issues such as plain packages for cigarettes, minimum pricing on alcohol and an end to selling sports fields . In 2013-14, the NHS budget was over ? 95bn, compared with only ? 1.8 bn allocated to Public Health England to promote \"wellness\" . The lack of investment in prevention, married to politicians' fear of the charge of \"uber-interference\" and \"the nanny state\", means that multinationals have too little restraint . We accept the so-called nanny state edicts on seat belts, smoking and drink , so why can't the state take a much greater role in improving the food that is sold to us and marketed to our children? Andy Burnham calls this \"finger wagging\" . On the contrary ,  it is lifesaving . It is welcome that Burnham has promised that Labour will legislate to reduce the sugar, fat and salt in foods sold to children . Such steps require rigour in the face of food industry claims that it's difficult to differentiate between \"family foods\" . The \"responsibility deal\" in which businesses voluntarily take action to improve public health hasn't produced many results . Last week, for instance, Asda promised to reduce 22% of added sugar in some 26 of its own brand drinks, amounting to a reduction of a staggering 3.25bn calories . However ,  Professor Graham MacGregor of Action on Sugar says that only reveals the scale of what remains to be done . Little bits of action are no substitute for sugar reduction mandated by government policy . As Burnham correctly said last week:\"For change to work in a market context, all players need to be following the same rules.\" Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, has warned that a 20% tax on sugar in fizzy drinks may be required . It makes sense . Advertising to children is another issue requiring intervention . Promoting unhealthy products is restricted on children's television but it is unfettered online in \"advergames\" and between 8pm and 9pm on television when, according to Malcolm Clark of the lobbying group, the Children's Food Campaign (CFC), ads are a junk food paradise . Burnham intends to ask the committee on advertising practice and the Advertising Standards Authority how children can be better protected . That is a cop-out . The CFC, backed by the British Heart Foundation, has rightly proposed a body independent from the advertising industry to monitor and regulate marketing to children and tougher enforcements . Managing diet, taking exercise and aiming for fitness can't be directly stipulated in law . Parents, government, the community and the commercial sector all play a part in taking responsibility . However ,  the balance of power is skewed against the ordinary citizen, particularly those penalised by profound health inequalities, and towards those with profit in mind . The state has to play a far more dynamic role than Labour envisages or the coalition provides, to ensure that what does us good, at a price we can afford, becomes the established framework for a healthy life .",

            "input": "It's time to reinvent what universities can be. With the annual Ucas university application deadline looming on Thursday, thousands of 17-year-olds will be putting the finishing touches to their personal statements . And so another cycle of conditional offers, A-level results and nervous forays into freshers' week begins . Unlike 50 years ago, when a tiny, socially elite proportion went to university , they will be joining almost 50% of their peers in studying for a degree, facing average costs of upwards of? 46k for a three-year degree, including tuition and living costs, compared with the generous grants available up until the 1990s . Setting expansion aside, it is remarkable how much hasn't changed: at the heart of the system remains a core model of young people moving away to university to study for three-year full-time degrees ; an expensive route for which they now bear much of the costs themselves . Yet the jobs market has changed beyond recognition . Graduates are now responsible for forging their own careers in a fluid market compared with the jobs for life that were the norm a few decades ago and employers are demanding a completely different set of skills . Does this model, then, remain fit for purpose? The political debate has focused on fee levels and headline prices to the exclusion of almost everything else, including the benefits and value of a university education - and how they might be improved . The debate about whether the 50% participation target is too high has been similarly staid : surely it's a no-brainer to hope that at least half of young people engage in advanced learning . But what type of learning should that be? One of the purported benefits of marketising higher education was that the market itself would deliver innovation and better value . But the government massively overegged the potential for higher education to behave like a market . Student demand far exceeds supply of places and price has become a proxy for quality . Little wonder, then, that average fees are far higher than the? 6,000 a year that the then universities minister, David Willetts, predicted when he introduced the? 9,000 fee cap . We now have the nonsense of a market where students pay the same for very different amounts and quality of academic provision . This is reflected in the variation in students' own perceptions : research by the consumer body Which? found almost a third of first-year undergraduates thought their course was poor value for money , while less than half thought seminars were worth attending . There is too little accountability for this variation within the powerful sector : universities award their own degrees ; the sector is opaque , even resisting moves to publish comparable information on the amount of teaching students can expect for their fees ; and the higher education regulator is weak, with virtually no powers to tell universities to buck up standards . The debate about innovation has centred on distance learning and Moocs (Massive Online Open Courses) . There is no doubt developments in technology have the potential to transform the way university education is experienced . But it's pointless to focus on technology at the expense of changes that need to happen in the system in order to take advantage of it . Moocs will not transform the sector until they are embraced by the most prestigious universities : why shouldn't you be able to study for a cut-price Oxford degree, half via YouTube and Skype, and half among the dreaming spires? Other innovations that could bring down costs without sacrificing quality might be a restructure of the system to standardise first-year curriculums , enabling young people to combine studying for a year or two at their local university with a year or two on campus at a more specialist institution . We could see more professional degrees co-delivered and funded by universities and employers, such as the accountancy degree offered by Durham and KPMG in which young people benefit from six years of combined university and work experience . Or there could be more intensive two-year courses, perhaps aimed at young people getting a year or two of work experience after school . University could be combined with more modern ways of adjusting to adulthood : for example, a year spent in a structured volunteering programme, such as that offered by the charity City Year, offers huge opportunities to develop the grit and teamwork so valued by today's employers , while making a real contribution to schools and other public services . But on some measures we are moving backwards, with a massive fall in numbers of part-time and mature students in the few years since the ? 9,000 fee cap was introduced . There are lessons from the 1960s , when Harold Wilson's government realised that the only way to increase access in the face of a reluctant sector was to back Michael Young's vision for a new institution, the Open University , which increased the student population by Britain by a fifth when it was launched via its distance learning degrees . Government can't simply wait for the sector to do what it is asked to do . It needs to foster a conversation with universities, students and employers about what it means to get a degree . Of course there will always be a role for the academic . But should we be shoehorning the majority of undergraduates into this model, or should getting a degree more routinely encompass work experience? It should also introduce strong new accountabilities within the sector . One way of doing this would be to separate degree-awarding powers from learning provision, as suggested by the Social Market Foundation . This would allow new providers to offer innovative ways of meeting the standards set by a Russell Group university, for example . And government should provide more incentives for universities to innovate . Come Friday, many teenagers will be heaving a collective sigh of relief once their applications are in . They deserve the best possible learning experience for the significant time and money they will invest in their degrees : it's critical we don't shy away from a challenge to universities to ensure their ivory towers continue to evolve to keep pace with the world around them .",

            "input": "Palestine's wasted time at the UN. Even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Palestinian Authority's just-thwarted attempt at a UN Security Council resolution was a spectacular waste of time, and needlessly handed Israel a symbolic diplomatic victory . The draft - which called for peace with Israel within a year, and an end to the occupation by 2017- fell one yes vote short of the minimum nine required in the 15-member Council . Five countries abstained , and two - the US and Australia - voted no . Draft resolutions are usually preceded by consultations with Council members, so whoever submits them knows, beforehand, which way the vote will go . This draft was no different . In fact ,  insufficient support among Council members was the initial reason given months ago by the PA for a delay in the vote . As such, it must have known prior to presenting the draft that it would fail , so why go through with it? In fact ,  why did the PA try to push through a resolution in the first place? Even if it mustered the minimum votes , the US would have used its veto , and the PA knew it . Not only have the Americans consistently scuppered any resolution that places even the slightest criticism or pressure on Israel , but Washington had been explicit about its intention to use its veto this time round if necessary . As such, it is puzzling that Jordan's UN Ambassador Dina Kawar, whose country submitted the draft with the backing of the PA and the Arab League, said she thought Council members should have had more time to discuss the proposal . What would be the point in the face of an assured American veto? The only way Washington would acquiesce was if the resolution called for an end to the Palestinian occupation of Israel . This makes PA President Mahmoud Abbas's recent statement that he had repeatedly postponed the resolution due to US pressure equally puzzling . Did he actually think anything he could say or do would lead to the US dropping such pressure, or that it would accept the draft that was presented? In any case, months of consultations and various reasons for delays only resulted in the continued watering down of the text . This led to widespread Palestinian condemnation, from the public and from every faction . Among the most prominent critics is the widely popular senior Fatah figure Marwan Barghouti , whose party dominates the PA and includes Abbas . Barghouti described the text as an \"unjustified fallback which will adversely affect the Palestinian position\" . Moreover ,  the draft was not put forward as a Chapter VII resolution , which would entail punitive measures for lack of compliance . As such , even if it was passed , Israel - which flatly condemned the PA's push from the outset- would be free to ignore it without consequence , as it has done with all the numerous Security Council resolutions over the decades . Indeed ,  the draft did not contain any wording that would cause Israel to worry . Given that the US veto shields Israel , and that existing resolutions are ignored with impunity , it is astounding that the PA had any faith left in the Council to attempt its latest futile exercise at statehood . Even the response of its UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour was telling in this regard ; \"The Security Council has once again failed to uphold its charter duties to address this crises and to meaningfully contribute to a lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions.\" It has long been clear that the UN is a highly unlikely place for Palestinians to seek justice , as the consistent wishes and support of the international community for their cause is held hostage by just one country . The very notion of Security Council vetoes makes the UN an inherently and woefully undemocratic institution . The irony is that in the case of Palestine, a democracy is to blame . The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, had the gall to say the resolution undermined efforts to \"achieve two states for two people\" . The entire point of the resolution was to create a state that the existing state is determined to deny . As such, one wonders if she even read the draft . It seems the mere mention of Israel automatically triggers an American veto . This whole months-long affair was an obvious exercise in futility , during which time Israel has further entrenched its occupation and colonisation of Palestine . The day after the resolution failed , Abbas signed a document requesting membership of the International Criminal Court . Given numerous previous threats to join the ICC, this is a welcome development . However ,  he should have done this the moment Palestine's upgraded status at the UN allowed it do so more than two years ago . Amid Israel's relentless colonisation and occupation, and after more than 20 years of fruitless negotiations, the Palestinians do not have the luxury of waiting indefinitely for statehood . As such, the PA must act with the necessary urgency and focus .",

            "input": "The Paris attacks and the failure of the republic. Following the Paris attacks, there appears to be a consensus that France has experienced a turning point in its modern history . Most commentators place an emphasis on the possible role external factors have played in this act of terrorism . Various external factors are cited , but they mostly focus on the conflicts in the Middle East and international tensions in general, in a bid to link the Paris attacks to extremist ideologies that promote such murderous acts . A week after the attack, the French political class and key media outlets remain focused on the security aspect and barely attempt to address the issue from a different angle . They do not question the responsibility held by French society and state - as well as the role of the socioeconomic policies practised by successive French governments - in addressing the woes of the socially marginalised and disenfranchised zones from which the Kouachi brothers sprang . How can this act be attributed only to dogmatic ideological motivations and grievances over international conflicts, given that the religious and ideological indoctrination process is too complicated to be attributed solely to external factors? As both French officials and analysts respond with emotion , they ignore a series of socioeconomic factors that have fuelled the motivations of the actors . It is important to remember that the perpetrators of the attack were born and raised in France in a poor, disadvantaged area where unemployment rates among the youth aged 18 to 24 years reaches 45 percent (compared to the national rate which is nearly 10 percent) . In these areas, called\"banlieues\", state infrastructure is almost non- existent and the population is subject to segregation and racial discrimination in terms of access to employment opportunities and housing , which in most cases leads to exclusion from the civic sphere . In 2006, an official case study focusing on access to employment conditions showed that 51 percent of young French candidates are subject to discrimination based on ethnic origin and/or skin colour . These conditions result in social marginalisation and promote delinquency which in turn raises the chances of incarceration ; a place where religious indoctrination and ideological radicalisation mostly occur . Sociologist Robert Castel describes the situation of young people in these deprived areas as follows:\"These young people are not completely [living] outside of society, however, they are not inside it either, for they do not enjoy any recognised space/role [...] Their situation is pretty paradoxical: they are citizens, who live on French territory, and yet they undergo differential and discriminatory treatment that disqualifies them. The republic, in contradiction with its own principles, seems incapable of integrating these young French people who live like the indigenous minority of the nation.\" This, combined with a conflicting social context that is constantly fuelled by debates over identity, religion and behavioural issues (such as the debate on national identity, the veil, halal food in schools, Islam and French secularism) further stigmatise this community and place it in a permanent state of confrontation with the rest of society . This vicious cycle prevents any change in the dynamics of this relationship into a cooperative one that could help find solutions in order to improve their socioeconomical status . Not to mention the mainstream media discourse permanently framing those zones and communities as an ailment to the society . Young people are depicted in a caricaturist form, making it all the more difficult for them to socially and professionally integrate , which deepens their sense of marginalisation . Such dynamics only complicate the relationship with the government, often seen as an opponent and sometimes as an enemy . This is the gap where religious indoctrination factors sneaks in - often occurring in prison environments where ethnic groups are predominantly from these areas and where 18- to 30 -year-olds represent 35 percent of the incarcerated population . Are these good enough reasons to explain the motives behind committing such a terrorist act? Of course not . But the conditions described above constitute the factors that facilitate and accelerate the ideological and religious indoctrination process . Especially when protagonists have the financial resources(this is often the case) to attract the most fragile, the most helpless and the most excluded in order to step forward and enrol in extremist activities , the international context helps . With such a grim reality, the question going forward would be if purely security measures are sufficient to challenge the terrorism that threatens France . We expected to find an answer to this question in Prime Minister Manuel Valls's speech at the National Assembly in which he outlined \"exceptional\" measures to be taken . \"France is at war against terrorism and against radical Islam,\" he said . \"Exceptional measures will be taken to challenge terrorism.\" Valls mentioned exclusively security measures, such as reinforcing supervision within the prisons where Islamist prisoners are concentrated; establishing inter-European border controls; strengthening international intelligence cooperation ... however ,  there was no mention of a possible revision of the government's social policies to address the problems in the marginalised zones; no announcement of a reflection on a possible serious debate to propose a new approach to address all the socioeconomic ills affecting them . The security measures announced by the prime minister are necessary, but not sufficient to contain terrorism ; the roots of extremism, where the first frustrations are formed, remain untouched . That is not to say that the French government should be solely held responsible for the situation which France is facing today . Nevertheless ,  failing to take into account the catastrophic socioeconomic factor would be tantamount to promoting the very context that contributes to the development of fundamentalist ideologies . The government urgently needs to review its social and economic policies towards these disadvantaged areas , developing real socioeconomic infrastructure, strengthening solidarity, emphasising the fight against discrimination in employment and housing, strengthening anti-racist laws and promoting a fairer media discourse towards these populations in order to improve their lot in life . This will undoubtedly contribute towards sterilising any niches where extremist ideology can take root .",

It is enforced not by a police bound by codes of conduct, but by a fear that dare not speak its name ; a cowardice so total it lacks the courage to admit it is afraid . The British are the world's worst cowards . It is one thing to say you don't approve of Charlie Hebdo's cartoons . But the BBC, Channel 4 and many newspapers won't run any images of Mohammad whatsoever . They would at least have acknowledged censorship if they had announced that they were frightened of attacks on their staff . They would have clung to a remnant of their honour if they had said:\"We are not censoring out of respect. We loathe the murderers who enforce their taboos with Kalashnikovs. But we do not want to spend years living in hiding, as Salman Rushdie did. Or be stabbed in the street, as Theo van Gogh was. Or hear an Islamist smash at our door with an axe and cry:\"We will get our revenge,\" - as Kurt Westergaard did. So we are backing away.\" Admittedly, an honest admission that terror works would shred the pretence that journalists are fearless speakers of truth to power . But it would be a small gesture of solidarity . It would say to everyone, from Pakistani secularists murdered for opposing theocratic savagery, to British parents worried sick that their boys will join Islamic State, that radical Islam is a real fascistic force . Instead ,  most journalists have lived a lie for years, as have many in the arts, academia and comedy . We take on the powerful - and ask you to admire our bravery- if, and only if, the powerful are not a paramilitary force that may kill us . The mass murder of cartoonists and police officers at Charlie Hebdo, and the attacks on Jews, which revive so many foul memories of European fascism, will change our world - almost certainly for the worst . Unless we find the courage to overcome fear , the self-censorship will spread, and not only in the media . Colleagues who wanted historians at a London museum to talk about the long history of depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art last week were met with panicking press officers trying to shut them up . Historian Tom Holland, who received death threats after he challenged the creation myths of Islam, said:\"I cannot think of any other area of history where debate is so nervous.\" He hopes that historians will continue to say that the Koran was a manmade creation, but doubts that journalists will be keen to take their work to the public . This is not a small capitulation . In the 19th century, the textual criticism of German scholars revealed that the supposed word of God in the Bible was a mess of competing stories . It did as much damage to Christianity and Judaism as Darwinism . Anyone hoping to repeat the exercise by taking apart the Koran and the hadiths today will be restrained by the fear that they will end up as dead as satirists who try to do the same with anti-clerical humour . My friend and comrade Maajid Nawaz was a jihadi before he converted to liberalism and understands the totalitarian mind . He says that people still do not realise that radical Islamists do not just want to impose their taboos at gunpoint . They want to \"create a civil war\" so that European Muslims accept that they can only live in the caliphate ; to encourage the rise of the white far-right so that ordinary coexistence becomes impossible . If they win one demand , as they are winning in Britain, then they will up the tension and move to another . As soon as you look at demands rather than labels, the wall dividing extremists from the rest begins to crumble . Saudi Arabia is Britain's trusted partner and ally . It receives vast quantities of armaments and in turn pumps propaganda into British mosques and universities . As Paris looked like a war zone, it flogged the Saudi liberal Raif Badawi for insulting Islam . At least they did not kill him, you might say . But if the religious courts had found him guilty of apostasy - that is, of taking the adult decision to abandon the religion of his childhood- the sentence would have been death . European liberals ought to have stopped, as the lash fell on Badawi's shoulders, and wondered about their queasiness at criticising the religions of the \"powerless\"and \"marginalised\" . The Saudi Arabian monarchy is all too powerful , as are the other dictatorships of the Middle East . Power depends on where you stand and who stands below you . The unemployed man with the gun is more powerful than the Parisian journalist . The marginal cleric may have a hard life , but if he sits in a sharia court imposing misogynist rules on British Muslim women he is to be feared . European liberals might try to be true to their principles and ally with dissidents, liberals, leftists and free thinkers within Muslim communities . They might help ex-Muslims who fear that one day they will be murdered for apostasy . They might reflect that a Muslim man will encounter xenophobia from the right , but they will hear no rigorous criticism at university or other leftist institutions of the sexism, anti-semitism, homophobia and bloodlust of militant religion . Self-interest ought to be a motivator . Fear of radical Islam is not only driving support for the National Front in France and Ukip here, but providing an excuse for more attacks on civil liberties, including, despite David Cameron's pious words after Charlie Hebdo, attacks on freedom of speech .

It is particularly important to be clear about where we stand , for the attackers said things that cannot be allowed to go unchallenged . They said they were avenging the prophet . That was wrong . In fact ,  it is the message of Islam, our principles and values, that have been betrayed and tainted . They refer to Islam to justify what they did . From a religious viewpoint, I feel it is my responsibility to say that this has nothing to do with the message of our religion . I would expect anyone, if something was happening in the name of their country or in the name of their religion, to take a stand . As a Muslim scholar I have to take that stand . That said , there is also a wider political side to this equation . We condemn what happened in France . We condemn the violent extremism that is targeting westerners .

What happened this week is a tragedy heightened by familiarity , for I met the cartoonist Charb (Stephane Charbonnier), the editor of Charlie Hebdo , who was among those killed on Wednesday . We had a debate in which I told him that I respected his freedom to say whatever he wanted to say, and that there was no justification for any kind of censorship .

Where was the freedom of expression there, I asked the satirical magazine . I was told that when it comes to freedom of expression that there are limits, not everything can be said . The double standard is troubling, to say the least . I am shocked that something as terrible as this has happened to Charb and his colleagues, but less surprised that there was a backlash against them . There had been controversy concerning Charlie Hebdo on an almost six-monthly basis, and lots of threats . To have a sense of humour is fine, I told them , but to target an already stigmatised people in France is not really showing much courage . The shootings have been described as an act of war . I can understand why some might characterise it that way . But they are wrong to do so , for isn't this exactly what the violent extremists such as Da'esh, so-called Islamic State, want? They want to say the west is at war with Islam , but if we are to take the action of marginal groups and use that as evidence that there is a war between Islam and the west , aren't we merely falling into a trap? George Bush fell into that very trap immediately after 9/11 by calling it the war on terror , but actually he promoted it with his rhetoric . The most we can reasonably say now is that we are at war with violent extremists , wherever they are coming from . But why play that game at all? Let's be specific: these are criminals exploiting Islam . The great majority of the victims are actually Muslim . There are tensions in many countries , but things have been very difficult of late in France . Two recently published books reflect the atmosphere: very negative and very demoralising . The French Suicide by Eric Zemmour expresses the fear that millions of Muslims might be colonising and transforming the country (he is hoping they will be helped to leave) , and Michel Houellebecq's novel Submission, which predicts that in 2022 an Islamic party will take over France . Three years ago, Houellebecq said Islam was the most stupid religion in the world . In the UK, in terms of daily life, the situation is better . There isn't that feeling of permanent stigmatisation in the discourse as happens in France . But even so, things feel as if they are changing for the worse . It is no accident that Ukip has been on the rise , and in such a climate one feels the public discourse changing . There are parties happy to target migrants and to target Muslims . It's a drift we have to stop , for in my view we actually have a shared responsibility . Politicians, intellectuals, journalists, Muslims and people of other faiths (or none) must be clear and united about our common principles . We need politicians with more on their minds than winning the next election . One sees difficult days ahead as yesterday's dramatic events in France showed ; and there is the issue of media organisations intent on publishing the most offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons, claiming that it would strike a blow for free speech . I support free speech , but I would urge them to desist , for what they plan to do is not courageous and will do nothing to afford people dignity . It will be another example of targeting all Muslims . It would say that if our fellow Muslim citizens are not part of the equation, we will target not the extremists- but Islam itself . It would hand the extremists a victory they could scarcely have achieved for themselves .",

            "input": "Paris lessons: US must revoke citizenship of Americans who join ISIS, Al Qaeda. Last week, France faced the threat that is arguably the toughest to defeat-- a threat from within, from its own terrorists . By now, the stories are familiar . France has a problem with homegrown radicals . At least 900 French citizens are among the 2,000 to 3,000 westerners who've left home for jihadist training or to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq . In many ways, the western jihadist represents the worst threat . Able to speak the language fluently, completely familiar with their home countries, and possessing a key weapon -- an American, British, French, or German passport -- they can easily cross international boundaries . The training makes them deadly -- the Paris attacks were notable for their deadly precision and meticulous planning . Their citizenship makes them mobile . That's why any American strategy to defeat jihad has to include measures to not just deny passports to American terrorists, but also strip them of citizenship . This is basic common sense . Most Americans would be surprised to know that joining Al Qaeda or ISIS - the Islamic State - isn't grounds for losing citizenship . The law currently provides that Americans can lose citizenship when they enter or serve in the armed forces of an enemy foreign state . But ISIS and Al Qaeda are not \"foreign states,\" so the law doesn't apply . It's time to close this loophole . In Congress, legislation was introduced last session to address those concerns . It was not approved . Now, in the new Congress - with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate - there's a renewed push to safeguard the homeland . Last week, Representative Ted Poe introduced a measure that revokes passports from Americans who join terrorist organizations . And ,  in the days ahead, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Steve King are expected to introduce legislation that would strip citizenship from terrorist traitors . This is not an imaginary threat . Not only have Americans joined ISIS , some have even lost their lives fighting for jihadists . In fact ,  as many as 40 men from Minneapolis alone have joined Islamic groups abroad . And just last week in Chicago, A U.S  citizen was indicted by a federal grand jury - charged with attempting to travel overseas to fight alongside the ISIS operating in Iraq and Syria . These men aren't just threats to the United States ; they're also threats to our closest allies . For our allies, the American passport is a ticket of entry, no visa required . And ,  similarly, for British, French, and other allies, their passport is a ticket of entry into the United States . The door is wide open for terrorists to take advantage of centuries of friendship and trust . It is time we slam that door shut . Of course stripping citizenship and revoking passports represent just two small steps - but critical ones - towards a sane national security strategy . However ,  it's difficult to take even these small steps with the Obama administration steadfastly refuses to name our enemies (Mr  President, our enemies are Islamic radicals, not generic \"extremists\"), accurately describe their ideology(no, they are not \"nihilists\"), or even to acknowledge their obvious, widespread appeal in the Muslim world . It was sad and embarrassing for Americans to watch as even the leader of the Palestinian Authority marched in Paris against Islamic extremism , yet our president or vice president were nowhere to be found . Even liberal journalists called this absence \"pathetic.\" Marches don't defeat terrorists , but when dozens of world leaders stand together , it makes a statement of determination that is critical for our citizens to see . When our President makes a stand, it signals our nation's resolve , and his absence signaled our government's weakness . In the days and weeks ahead, Congress can send a very different message by passing much needed legislation, putting it on the President's desk, and daring him to veto legislation that would prevent exactly the kind of attack France faced last week . After almost six full years in office, we fully understand the President's approach to combatting terrorism . A recipe that mixes drone strikes with appeasement-- that pulls troops from combat and sends captive terrorists back to the Middle-- is now a proven failure . In my bestselling book, \"Rise of ISIS: A Threat We Can't Ignore,\" I demonstrated the consequences of that failure . Jihad rages across the Middle East, Boko Harem rampages through Nigeria , and Afghanistan teeters on the brink of disaster . In the west, recent terror attacks in Canada, Australia, and Paris show jihadists ability to inspire even western Muslims with a message of pure hate and evil . Will the Obama administration change course? Will it finally acknowledge the true dimensions of the threat? It can start with a dose of common sense . It can start by protecting America from terrorist traitors .",

The horrifying shooting by masked gunmen at a Paris magazine office, which has left 12 dead, is an assault on everyone in the news business . And the fact that the paper, Charlie Hebdo, is a satirical publication matters not at all , since satire can sting as sharply as any media commentary -- especially when it comes to the sensitive subject of religion . Several news outlets are reporting that the attackers identified themselves as being from Al Qaeda in Yemen . But whatever branch of Islamic terrorism is responsible for this heinous crime, the targeting of the French paper is no accident . On its cover today is a caricature of a controversial novelist, Michel Houellebecq , whose book\"Submission\" forecasts a France run by Muslims and where polygamy is practiced . And the last tweet posted by the magazine was a mocking spoof of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . Charlie Hebdo has been a target before . Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after the paper ran a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad vowing \"100 lashes if you don't die laughing!\" The vicious attack would be shocking news even if the target was an insurance company office . But by singling out a media enterprise -- especially one that has dared to poke fun at Islam-- the terrorists are sending an even louder message , one designed to frighten and intimidate . We saw the same evil calculation in the decision by ISIS to kill journalists James Foley and Steve Sotloff and to circulate video of their beheadings . This was a way to amplify the propaganda value of such executions and generate even more coverage by journalists who felt an instinctive kinship with their fallen brethren . That ploy worked , as ISIS sparked weeks of anguished coverage around the globe , and the images of the soon-to-be-murdered journalists, published far too often in my view, became the face of Islamic terror . After that, even as the U.S  and its allies struck back at ISIS in Iraq and Syria , the coverage greatly receded . Terrorists understand the media's need to personalize a tragic story . Wednesday's attack was also a far bloodier version of the Sony Pictures hacking , which was aimed at paralyzing and humiliating a media company over its ill-advised film that depicted North Korean strongman Kim Jong-un's head being blown up . That act of cyberterrorism also served as a warning to other media outfits that might take on North Korea . Charlie Hebdo specialized in skewering sacred cows . \"Its pages are filled with vulgar caricatures and caustic humor, lampooning politicians, entertainers and media personalities of all stripes,\" the New York Times reported three years ago,\"and the magazine has found itself a frequent presence at Paris courts, accused on several dozen occasions of defamation or inciting hate . \"The world's religions have also been favorite targets of the paper, this being France, where state-mandated secularism is a sort of religion of its own. The cover page of one recent issue featured a cartoon of three rolls of toilet paper, labeled Bible, Koran and Torah, and the headline: 'In the toilet, all the religions .'\". The danger now is that journalists around the world will engage in self- censorship, that they will pull back on aggressive reporting and analysis of Islamic terrorism . For every potentially provocative article, headline or cartoon, some will ask themselves, is this worth the risk? Wouldn't it be easier, safer, to let this one go? And each time that happens, the gunmen who unleashed a hail of bullets in a Paris magazine office Wednesday will have won .

            "input": "Paris: Why Obama's presence Sunday would have been height of hypocrisy. Commentators from both sides of the political aisle have discussed the \"optics\" of President Obama's absence from the massive, anti-terrorism march in Paris on January 11 . Sadly, they've all missed the point . It would have represented a glaring hypocrisy for Mr  Obama, or any highly- ranked official from his administration, to attend the rally . A sad fact about our pundit class, conservative or progressive, is that they too often miss the obvious . That condition infects both critics and supporters of the Obama administration . They simply cannot connect the dots with this leader . After all ,  he is an unusual president . So let me draw a line between the unconnected dots . Just two years ago, the administration blamed the killing of the American ambassador to Libya, and three security personnel, on a video that negatively depicted the prophet Muhammad . Remember that? You see , it was an unknown, bigoted Christian man from California who single- handedly caused the death of our ambassador . According to the administration, the film by Nakoula Basseley Nakoulahad sparked spontaneous riots to defend Muhammad's honor , and our ambassador got caught up in the mayhem . Mr  Obama called the filmmaker a \"shadowy character,\" and in front of the United Nations and the world, blamed the attack on the \"disgusting\" movie . At that podium, he declared that \"the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.\" Congressional hearings later proved that the violence in Benghazi was due to a coordinated terrorist attack , and had nothing to do with a protest over the movie . But administration officials stuck to the lie . Just a few weeks after the attack, the filmmaker was arrested on parole charges by federal authorities , probably taking orders from Attorney General Holder . Now fast-forward to the rally in Paris-- the one that Holder would not deem worthy to attend, even though he was in Paris at the time . The one that President Obama, nor Vice President Biden, nor Secretary of State Kerry would attend either , even though other major world leaders rushed to Paris to demonstrate their solidarity . Let me draw the line between the dots a little darker :. Q : Who did the terrorists attack in Paris on January 7? A: A satirist magazine that had mocked Christians for years . Q: Why did the terrorists kill those specific journalists and cartoonists? A : For a mocking portrayal of Muhammad . Q : Isn't that the same issue that had enraged the White House after the Benghazi attack? A : You betcha . The \"bad optics\" that so many pundits are complaining about actually fit perfectly into the philosophical mindset of this White House . They do not want us to insult their Islamist friends . In the eyes of the Obama administration, the jihadists in Libya and France committed the same savagery for the same reason . Give the administration credit for consistency . They're not about to appear sympathetic to a French cartoonist when they had condemned the filmmaker from California . Having persecuted the latter , they weren't about to march to defend the former . What represents bad optics to most civilized people's worldview represents good optics to the Obama administration's worldview . It's all too clear that America and the world have no hope of stopping these never-ending barbaric acts until a Reagan-like figure steps up . A leader who will honestly and courageously define such terrorism as it really is : An Islamist's interpretation of the Koran . That's the definition recently used by President el-Sisi of Egypt, a man of far greater honesty and courage than America's current counterpart . Only with an American leader of Reagan-like strength will we be able to develop a plan and the determination to defeat the dark ideology of Islamism , just like Reagan managed to defeat the Soviet Union and its evil ideology .

And, there are a lot of people on the other side who are angry at those efforts . And so, this whole battle over whether to say Christmas or Happy Holidays misses the point . I suppose it may be hard to be a non-believer in the religious themes around Christmas and live in our culture . You are confronted daily with the religious symbolism of Christmas in the books you read, the friends you have and the movies you watch ; and , above all ,  you have to stay away from religious stuff...like Christmas celebrations . I'm a believer, but not without a modicum of compassion for those who don't share my religious beliefs . I can imagine how irritating Christmas must be for those whose whole worldview is built on the belief that Christmas doesn't matter because it points to what is spurious at best and dangerous at worst . I get that, too . I must admit, though, that I get irritated sometimes when a group of people bring a lawsuit to get rid of the town creche or when someone wishes me \"Happy Holidays.\" It bothers me when universities remove Christmas trees or Christmas concerts are canceled because it offends those who aren't religious or Christian . Frankly, I listen to a lot of stuff from the other side all the time . Fair play suggests that it wouldn't hurt for the other side to abide some of mine . I decided that I'm just not going to fight the Christmas war . I'm an old guy and old people are already irritated about being old . As someone said, it takes very little to tick us off . Instead, I'm just going to sing as loudly and as publicly as I can a Christmas carol---a Christmas carol about love and a God who went to a lot of trouble to express his love for us . You see , in my belief system, Christmas doesn't mean that God came to destroy us or to kick posteriors . I believe that the reason he came was to tell us that he isn't angry . And when we make obscene gestures or get mean with those who disagree with us, it kind of misses the point . It becomes a disconnect between what I believe and what I do . And if I really believe(and I do) that the King came , it kind of changes my perspective . I have a friend whose family takes playing chess very seriously . It gets so \"hot\" sometimes that they end up throwing chess pieces at one another . As you can imagine , they lose a lot of pieces . One Christmas when they were playing chess, my friend took the baby Jesus from the small creche under the Christmas tree to replace one of his lost pieces . My friend then began to move all over the board, going after his brother's pieces . \"You can't do that,\" his brother said,\"that's illegal.\" \"Oh, yes I can,\" my friend said.\"This is Jesus and he can do whatever he wants to do.\" Jesus does as he pleases and he does it right well . At Christmas he decided to love and, then, clean up the mess later . So I think I'll opt out of the war . The King was doing fine before I came along and will do fine long after I'm gone . He doesn't need my defense . So, Merry Christmas or...uh .... Happy Holidays . Whatever .",

            "input": "Philippines-China standoff: David vs Goliath? In recent years, the South China Sea has (once again) transformed into a theatre of competition among rival claimant states . Outmatched and outgunned by China, the Philippines has sought to resolve the disputes by resorting to legal arbitration, hoping that international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), will serve as an amicable basis for settling maritime conflicts . But China has unequivocally rejected the arbitration process as an infringement on its national sovereignty and territorial integrity , recently releasing a position paper that details its rationale for opposing any third- party intervention in the disputes . The South China Sea represents a potential flashpoint with global ramifications . Connecting one of the most dynamic economies of the 21st century, the waters facilitate more than $5 trillion in annual trade . Crucially, the bulk of the energy imports of industrial powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea pass through the South China Sea . The very economic survival and energy security of major Asian economies is anchored by unimpeded access to international waters such as the South China Sea . Almost everyone has an interest in the peaceful settlement of the disputes . But it is far from certain whether the Philippines' legal manoeuvre will contribute to the de-escalation of maritime tensions . China has vehemently rejected the entire arbitration process, accusing the Philippines of stirring trouble and jeopardising historically stable bilateral ties . Technically, the maritime disputes involve six rival claimant states: China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan . The bitterest disputes, however, involve China, on one hand, and the Philippines and Vietnam, on the other . Fortunately, the latest wave of maritime spats hasn't yet sparked a full-scale military confrontation . The last bloody standoff was in the latter decades of the Cold War , when China tried to wrest control of the Paracel (1974) and the Spratly (1988) islands from the South Vietnamese and (united) Vietnam forces, respectively . But amid a flurry of nationalist bombast, backed up by wide-ranging - civilian and military - construction activities as well as paramilitary patrols across disputed areas, there are growing concerns over accidental clashes and unintended escalation in the high seas . In short ,  freedom of navigation (FoN) - a pillar of commerce and trade - in the South China Sea could be in peril . Given the significance of the South China Sea to regional trade and security, non-claimant states such as the US, Japan, and Indonesia have also been drawn into the territorial disputes . Washington is bound by treaty obligations to defend Asian allies such as the Philippines, against external aggression . As some commentators would put it , the maritime rivalries resemble a three-dimensional chess game, threatening strategic, economic, and political interests in the region, with ever-growing number of players injecting additional layers of complexity and risk to the problem . While all actors have contributed to the escalation of tensions in the area , the consensus among independent experts is that China's sweeping claims, particularly its notorious \"nine-dashed line\" doctrine, has served as a major stumbling block in resolving the territorial disputes . China's claims are simultaneously expansive and ambiguous . The \"nine-dashed line\" covers almost the entirety of the South China Sea, even overlapping with Indonesia's waters , but Beijing has not clarified its precise coordinates . It isn't clear whether China is claiming the land features and their surrounding territorial waters, or treating the entire area as an internal lake . China has evoked\"historical rights\" and\"inherent and indisputable sovereignty\" over the South China Sea , which, most experts believe, has little basis in modern international law . Despite signing the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which discourages claimant states from unilaterally altering the status quo , China has stepped up its construction activities and paramilitary patrols across disputed waters . In terms of size and capabilities, China dwarfs all its neighbours combined . The regional geopolitical landscape is highly lopsided . Eager to maintain stable ties with Beijing, Washington has consistently refused to take sides in the disputes , limiting its concern to FoN in the South China Sea . Against the backdrop of deteriorating regional security, leading to a brief and perilous standoff between Filipino and Chinese forces over the Scarborough Shoal (220 km off the coast of the Philippines, and 900km away from the nearest Chinese coastline) . In mid-2012, Manila decided to take China to the special Arbitral Tribunal in The Hague . As a signatory to the UNCLOS, China has (under Article 298) rejected compulsory arbitration over maritime disputes , but the tribunal has the power to determine whether it can exercise jurisdiction over the case and judge the merits of the Philippines' complaint against China . The Philippines aim is to pressure China to clarify its claims as well as determine the nature of contested features in the South China Sea , specifically whether they can generate their own independent territorial waters . In the end, the Philippines might end up with a pyrrhic victory . In the absence of any tangible compliance-enforcement mechanism, China can reject any unfavourable judicial outcome; launch a media campaign to delegitimise the arbitration proceedings; contemplate sanctions and other forms of diplomatic counter-manoeuvres to isolate the Philippines; and project toughness (to its domestic hyper-nationalist audience) by stepping up its activities in the area . Ultimately, the best solution may lie in direct engagement, confidence- building measures, and sustained bilateral negotiations rather than compulsory arbitration . Both Manila and Beijing will have to devise a diplomatic strategy outside the courts of law .",

While the boxing world's attention is focused on whether a fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao might finally happen , Mayweather has announced that he will visit Australia at the end of the month . The world's best boxer and highest paid athlete won't be fighting of course, merely making promotional appearances in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane . Even leaving aside the disturbing idea that real, living people might pay to see the petulant man known as \"Money\" do anything other than box, there' s an issue: his extensive history of domestic violence . As Phil Lutton points out , Mayweather has been arrested or cited by police in seven assaults against five different women . Mayweather's history of domestic violence began in 2001, just a month after dedicating his fight against Diego \"Chico\" Corrales to \"all the battered women in the world.\" He allegedly closed a car door on his then-partner Melissa Brim before repeatedly punching her while she lay on the back seat . Not six months later he punched Brim in the neck at a Las Vegas shopping centre . He pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence . In 2003 Mayweather allegedly punched two friends of his then-partner (and the mother of several of his children) Josie Harris in a nightclub and shook a female security guard . He was issued a citation and found guilty of two counts of battery , though the verdict was vacated and the charges were \"dismissed per negotiations.\" The same year he allegedly pummelled Harris and dragged her from a car by her hair , though she later dropped the charges and testified that she had lied to police . Mayweather bought Harries a $500,000, 25-carat diamond ring shortly afterwards . In 2011 he finally did jail time (90 days) for savagely beating Harris in front of their children . He might have done many more if he wasn't a multi- millionaire and a linchpin of the economy in his home state of Nevada . Even boxing fans, who are usually loathe to judge fighters for their conduct outside the ring(few boxers are angels, after all), are unimpressed with Mayweather . And though boxing is a bit of a cultural afterthought these days, comments Mayweather made in support of abuser Ray Rice before his most recent fight focused the attention of the mainstream media on his unsavoury past . Nevertheless ,  he was unrepentant . Though Mayweather's criminal past might not automatically disqualify him from receiving an Australian visa , he would have to sit a \"character test\" on arrival . If you watch the video above , I'm sure you'll agree that such a test could be a major stumbling block . In a similar case, Australia granted Mike Tyson, who was jailed for rape in 1992, a visa in 2012 , though New Zealand did not . So should Australia bar Mayweather? What's to gain from him visiting? He's a disgusting, unrepentant assaulter of women and his\"I do what I want-ism\" is totally undesirable . America might be stuck with him , but I don't see why we should welcome him and allow him to make money in our country . Last year Australia cancelled the visa of pick up artist Julien Blanc, whose techniques included simulated choking of women in bars, after a social media campaign and protests at venues . There has been nothing simulated about Mayweather's repeated punching of the women in his life , so I'd imagine he (and the venues that welcome him) can expect the same treatment . On a more selfish note, I simply can't face the prospect of sections of the Australian media writing seriously about Anthony Mundine fighting Mayweather . Mundine has begun to retweet fans(they are out there) who want him to call Mayweather out . The flow of indistinguishable-from-parody articles has already begun . Please Floyd, concentrate on fighting Manny . We'll be fine without you . No, really .",

A member of the \"United Friends and Families Campaign\" spoke to protesters about some of these cases, including that of a 40-year-old mother, Joy Gardner . Her only relation to Eric Garner, he explained, is that she, too, couldn't breathe after 13 feet of tape was wrapped in at least seven complete turns around her head . She fell into a coma and was pronounced dead four days later . Azelle Rodney, 24, was killed in 2005 . He was shot six times within two seconds of police officers ramming the vehicle in which he was travelling . His body was then left on the pavement for 16 hours - not unlike Mike Brown in the streets of Ferguson . Only after nearly 10 years of campaigning led by Rodney's mother, Susan Alexander, is an officer now facing a murder charge . Among those who addressed protesters was Marcia Rigg, the sister of Sean Rigg . He died in police custody at the entrance to Brixton police station in 2008 after a violent arrest . Despite being clearly unwell, he had been handcuffed and left dying on the floor . A police officer, filmed on CCTV, said that he was \"faking it\" . Christopher Alder died while in police custody at Queen's Gardens Police Station in Kingston upon Hull . Having been taken to the station with a head injury, he was unresponsive when he was dragged from a police van . He lay on the floor of the custody suite for 11 minutes, CCTV footage shows, gasping for breath, with his hands cuffed behind him and his trousers round his ankles . A pool of blood formed around his mouth . Instead of being given medical attention, five police officers stood around commenting that he was \"right as rain\" and his agony was \"just a show\" . They even made monkey noises . Four years earlier in 1994, Shiji Lapite died after being placed in a police van in east London . A post-mortem found that Lapite had died of asphyxiation, suggesting that police officers had used a chokehold . But while the inquest into his death recorded a verdict of unlawful killing , the Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute the officers involved . In fact ,  no officer has been convicted over a death in police custody since 1969 , when the two Leeds police officers responsible for the death of David Oluwale, were found guilty of assault . Negative experiences of police treatment are a consistent feature of the lives of many people, especially those who are young, black and come from the working class . Families often suffer not just the initial news of the deaths of their loved ones in custody, but a concerted media campaign from the police smearing the reputations of the victim in the following weeks . The family of Mark Duggan weren't even informed of his death, instead finding out from TV news . And these deaths represent only the worst and most painful cases of police violence . Many \"lesser\" incidents go virtually unreported . Even when these are recorded- as was a London police officer's threat that \"if you say one more fucking word, I'll smash your fucking Arab face in\" to a 16-year-old teenager in 2005- officers never face serious charges . Since the Macpherson report of 1999, which famously pointed to \"institutional racism\" within the Met, there has been little evidence of structural or far- reaching change in the way the police are held accountable . As in other European countries, especially France, anger at the police in the UK has repeatedly boiled over into riots . The police killing of Duggan in 2011, which sparked the riots of that summer, is the clearest recent case . Eighty-five percent of participants in those riots who were questioned by the Reading the Riots study said policing was an \"important\" or \"very important\" factor in why the riots happened . They pointed to long histories of being subjected to humiliating stop-and- searches and beatings by the police , who were often described as operating like a \"gang\" . The common view is that there is little point in attempting recourse via the official police complaint procedures . This was confirmed by a recent investigation by Channel 4 Dispatches , which showed that just one percent of allegations of racism by members of the public against the police in England and Wales were upheld over an eight year period . And yet ,  despite our knowledge that experiences of police violence have led to riots, the reaction of successive British governments has been to implement ever-harsher policing, especially in black and working-class communities . This coincides with a continued police clampdown in Muslim communities that has generated widespread anger for its methods, including the manufacture of evidence against Muslim suspects and long imprisonment periods for writing Facebook posts . We demonstrated on December 10 not only to show solidarity with those in the US, but also to point to the similar struggles for justice that we are facing here in the UK . In the late evening, dozens of protesters were corralled in the cold for over an hour before being arrested, loaded onto two buses commandeered for the purpose, and driven to various police stations around London . Many were kept in the cold for hours before being led to holding cells . Many were released miles from home in the very early morning . There can be little doubt that this tactic of mass arrests, which is becoming more prominent, is aimed at dissuading future protest . Those arrested are given \"interview\" dates well into the future - often with stringent bail conditions - and warned about commenting publicly before this date . They are, as such, effectively gagged . There is no small irony in this response to a demonstration about police violence . But we have little intention of remaining silent . After decades of campaigning led by affected families, the movement for police accountability is developing new tactics and involving a growing number of young people who are determined to be the generation that sees change . Along with our friends in the US, we adopt Garner's words to the police as our slogan . This stops today .",

            "input": "Pope Francis, Salman Rushdie and Charlie Hebdo. There is some common ground, but not much . The killings in Paris last week were horrifying crimes that expose the vulnerability of democratic societies to lethal vigilante violence, whether facilitated from outside or as a spontaneous expression of homegrown psychopathic alienation . Beyond this morbid reality associated with the murder of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, police officers, and the supermarket hostages, there is nothing but darkness , and in that darkness some additional monsters lurk . We can be thankful once more for the moral clarity of Pope Francis who in the impromptu setting of a plane taking him from Sri Lanka to Manila shined some light on the darkness . Unlike those who so ardently wielded the slogan \"Je Suis Charlie\", the pope understood that free speech without limits is an invitation to indulge the worst negative impulses that will then operate as viruses destroying the vital organs of the body politic . What Pope Francis underscored was the impossibility of reconciling dignity with hurtful insults . He illustrated his view by saying that if his companion on the plane, Dr Alberto Gazparri, a Vatican official, were to insult Francis' mother, he could expect to be punched . He called such behaviour normal:\"It's normal. It's normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others.\" Perhaps, this is too strong an expression of limits , but it does indirectly raise the Derrida urgent question of learning to \"live together\" in peace and with respect within globalising social space . Response to provocation . Francis goes on to say that to kill in response to provocation, however severe, is not compatible with religion properly understood . It is behaviour of \"deviant forms of religion\" . He goes on to say\"To kill in the name of God is an aberration\" . At the same time , how lines are drawn with respect to acceptable and unacceptable forms of provocation is highly political and culturally influenced . In one respect, France and other governments understand both sides of this argument, but twist it for political purposes . The popular comedian Dieudonne is being currently prosecuted in France for\"defending terrorism\" because his humour deeply offends Jews, Zionists, and Israel . There are no less than 54 cases in the country associated with \"condoning terrorism\" . The Associated Press reports that just now \"France ordered prosecutors around the country to crack down on hate speech, anti-Semitism, and glorifying terrorism\" . But note no message by the French government is sent mentioning \"hate cartooning\" or addressing the surge of \"Islamophobia\" in the country in the days following the January 7 attack on the Charlie Hebdo editorial offices . A large number of mosques in France and elsewhere in Europe have been desecrated in the last week . This kind of double standards performs a variety of insidious functions for the French state . It uses the language of \"terrorism\" to demonise its political enemies and \"free speech\" to immunise its political friends . It merges the criminalisation of anti-Semitism with strong criticisms of Israel along with any advocacy of boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) . And it makes it even clearer to Muslims that they are fair game for Islamophobes and xenophobes . In effect, a French political community is being upheld that seeks to include Jews as valued and protected members while reinforcing the Muslim understanding that their residences and social standing can be fully understood by reference to the no-go banilieus of the country . Salman Rushdie's ordeals . In the wake of these events, there is a new sympathetic look back at the ordeals of Salman Rushdie endured after the publication of his satirical novel \"The Satanic Verses\" in 1988 . Rushdie, appearing as a guest on Bill Maher's talk show and delivering a lecture at the University of Vermont, understandably defended freedom of expression as an absolute right . His words, deeply felt, are worth heeding as the counterpoint to the views expressed by Pope Francis : \"And so artists who ... push outwards often find very powerful forces pushing back . They find the forces of silence opposing the forces of speech . The forces of censorship against the forces of utterance ... At that boundary is that push-and-pull between more and less . And that push and pull can be very dangerous to the artist . And many artists have suffered terribly for that.\" The context of Rushdie's recent remarks was the Charlie Hebdo incident , but his outlook was intended to be sweeping in its generality . And yet he did not, nor did Bill Maher, pause to take note of those powerful forces in the West that have tried to shut down critics of Israel by shouting \"anti-Semite\" at the top of their lungs . Without some degree of consistency it is difficult to consider clearly the societal choice at stake . What makes this confrontation so difficult to resolve is that it engages two truths, not one . The beginning of ethical credibility is to insist upon consistency . Either Rushdie and France have to abide by the unsavoury views of Dieudonne as well as those of Charlie Hebdo or it should suppress them both . If it allows both then it is opting for the Rushdie view that members of a modern society must learn to live with the extremes of cultural freedom even if hurtful . If it allows neither then it is choosing to protect the sensibilities of minorities and others whose dignity is under attack . Of course ,  there are many compromises that can be made to ensure maximum freedom of expression while acknowledging certain limits . The US Supreme Court long ago decided that free speech does entitle someone to yell \"fire\" in a crowded theatre . This is what courts are for , to draw these lines in specific cases, balancing opposing truths in the light of practicality and the evolving values of the community . What a judicial body had to say about race or homosexuality a century ago is different than what it says today . And as we in the US know too well , the prevailing ideology among the justices is often of greater importance to determining how such lines are drawn than are the legislative or constitutional enactments being interpreted . In some respects, then, such determinations are more part of the problem than of the solution . Abstract sentiments . I find myself siding with the abstract sentiments of Pope Francis, but with Rushdie's view of minimising the role of law and the state . In this respect , if we impose limits by way of government we are entering the domain of censorship . At the same time ,  we need to protect individuals and groups against malicious forms of defamation and hateful attacks on identities without confusing such protection with efforts to channel public awareness in certain prescribed directions . My own experience suggests that \"freedom\" of this sort has been used by some pro-Zionist and pro-Israeli organisations to discredit and deter and criticism of Israel, and especially of Israeli state crimes victimising the Palestinian people . In Rushdie's case we need to protect his right to publish \"The Satanic Verses\", while condemning the fatwa imposing a death sentence for blasphemy and apostasy, yet upholding the right of non-western political communities to prohibit distribution of such a book because of its provocative nature in certain civilisational settings . Obviously, there are no cookie cutter answers . The proper limits are a matter of history, ethics, cultural priorities, and circumstances . I feel that the central question is raised by Derrida's inquiry into how we can learn to live together . For me, living together, given the originality of our historical moment, involves the construction of overlapping political communities of destiny - from family to world, with a major focus on the national political community combined with a greater effort to establish a global political community so that challenges posed by climate change, nuclear weaponry, infectious disease, and world poverty can be addressed more effectively and humanely .",

            "input": "Pope Francis' Vatican just gave Democrats a big boost for 2016. A bombshell Vatican report released Monday that gives a green light to the social activism of left-wing U.S  nuns is the latest example of how the more liberal papacy of Pope Francis could affect the outcome of the 2016 US elections . The report forms the conclusion of an investigation, known as an \"Apostolic Visitation,\" into the practices and beliefs of sisters across the U.S that was launched in 2008 under the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI amid long-standing concerns that many orders had lost their way . Although there are a significant number of vibrant orthodox orders, such as the pro-life Sisters of Life, the Dominican Sisters of St  Cecilia and the Little Sisters of the Poor (who are currently fighting the ObamaCare contraception mandate) , a much larger number of orders have rejected Catholic doctrines on the divinity of Christ, on sacramental theology and on moral issues such as abortion, contraception and gay marriage . Instead they substituted in alternative, non-Christian forms of spirituality that rejected fundamental Catholic truths, accompanied by a turn toward aggressively partisan left-wing social activism . What was being investigated was on show in 2012, with a group of left-wing nuns forming a slick national campaign called the \"Nuns on the Bus,\" campaigning against the proposed Ryan budget plan . Last year their tour topic was another Democrat favorite -- amnesty for illegal immigrants . Heading up the travelling sisters is Sr. Simone Campbell -- a lawyer and lobbyist who also led the nuns who defied the US bishops' condemnation of ObamaCare, signed a letter supporting the law and attended the signing ceremony at which she received a hug from President Obama . At that time, the power of the \"Nuns on the Bus\" was limited by their designation as rebels . With a Vatican investigation under way, it made it difficult for the nuns to claim to be the authentic moral voice of Catholicism . However ,  since then, Pope Francis has taken over and brought with him a certain interpretation of Catholic social teaching which adheres a lot closer to the tenets of the Democratic Party than more universally acknowledged truths pushed by Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II . The results of the probe will no doubt invite speculation that Pope Francis has had heavy influence over the findings of the report , which can comfortably be described as a whitewash . The report mentions nothing of the \"secularist mentality\" and radical feminism that had been given as the reason for the launch of the investigation , and is mostly a document of praise which offers little-to-no criticism, no disciplinary action and says the nuns' work resonates with Pope Francis' emphasis on social justice . The report even manages to take a swipe at the U.S  economy , praising the nuns for working in an economy that too often \"creates inequity and exclusion.\" It is better than anything the liberal nuns could have hoped for . The liberal orders aren't out of the woods yet . A separate investigation by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith into the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) -- a coalition of predominantly left-wing orders -- is not complete , and the doctrinal watchdog is likely to find something in a group that prides itself in rebelling against Church teaching . However ,  Monday's report gives left-wing nuns, and the Democratic Party a big boost for 2016 . The Catholic vote has been decisive in modern U.S  politics , and Catholic Democrats have often hyped their faith around election time . Joe Biden in particular has stood up as the advocate for liberal nuns, recently attending a \"Nuns on the Bus\" rally and in the past reportedly telling Pope Benedict XVI that he was being too hard on them and that he should \"lighten up.\" With a recent Vatican synod appearing to undermine Church teaching on controversial issues , the new report is another blow to more traditional Catholics who, when the radical nuns are talking, have always been able to point out their status as rebels and dissenters ignoring Church teaching . Unless the CDF does a dramatic about-face with its report , the Democrats' favorite nuns will now claim to have Vatican approval . With a green light from Rome, expect left-wing nuns and the Democrat Party to be emboldened in their push to present the nuns -- and the Democrats -- as the authentic voice of Catholicism, putting the Democrats in a better position to retain and expand upon the often-decisive Catholic vote in 2016 .",

            "input": "Power without purpose: the tragic rule of David Cameron. When the history of David Cameron's time as prime minister is written , no doctrine will be named after him . The government has been ideological, but not in a way that bears an intellectual imprint of the Conservative leader . There have been upheavals in schools, the health service and the benefits system , but those revolutions belong to Michael Gove, Andrew Lansley and Iain Duncan Smith . Cameron gave permission , he never pioneered . Cameron has also said he abhors \"isms\" and wouldn't want posterity to anoint him with one . Friends say this makes him a practical conservative of the old school , guided by ancient and uncodified British instincts of decency . His enemies think that is a posh way of saying he lacks principle . With no pattern of belief associated with his name, Cameron's legacy will be a collection of tactical manoeuvres, with as many prominent surrenders as victories . The true spirit of \"Cameronism\" in education, for example, is better conveyed in the removal in 2014 of Gove to placate the teaching profession than in his appointment to shake up the department in the first place . But in no field is the Tory leader's trademark better defined than in his approach to Europe . If any political manoeuvre deserves to be named after the Conservative leader , it is the habit of trying to sate the appetites of hardline Eurosceptics with morsels that would always leave them hungry . It might be called the \"Cameron concession\" . Thus has he fed the Eurosceptic pack enough to keep it snapping at his heels and frustrated it enough that his voice was drowned by angry barking . Perhaps the saddest aspect of this spectacle is that it saw a potentially sound policy trampled in the melee . The outline of Cameron's position is that Britain should stay in the EU but under changed terms . They will change anyway because the priority for most other member states is bolstering the single currency . This involves the integration of a euro-core with serious implications for Britain's status one way or another . So the principle of pro- active renegotiation, ratified by referendum, is sound . But Cameron spoiled a plausible position with cowardice : he set his renegotiation up as an empty vessel into which hardliners poured Ukip-ish fantasies of ending immigration . He bought the argument that says the terms on offer from Brussels get better the closer Britain gets to the exit , although that logic is commonly advanced by people who want the negotiations to fail . The deadline for his referendum, the end of 2017, was plucked from thin air without regard for what was diplomatically feasible or economically wise . But the chief reason Cameron's EU policy hasn't worked for him is that voters also consider motive when awarding merit . Those who want a referendum in order to leave the EU mistrust the prime minister because he wants a different outcome ; and pro-Europeans don't trust Cameron to defend Britain's interests in Europe because the whole policy came about as a sop to the sceptics . That doesn't leave many people who think the Tories have the right policy for the right reason . Europe exemplifies the problem , but it runs deeper . Cameron's team are sure they are running on an admirable record: economic growth, rising employment, lower crime, a reduced deficit and reformed welfare . These are things, like the EU referendum, that should make the Tories popular . By the same calculation, Labour, lacking those credentials, should be out of the running . Yet the campaign has started and Ed Miliband is still ahead . Downing Street clings to the now familiar explanation that voters haven't properly engaged with the choice, and that the Tory surge will come at the eleventh hour when the reality of a possible Miliband regime penetrates the national consciousness . But what if Cameron has hit the limit of credit available for five years in charge because even the good bits don't connect in people's minds with decent motives? That is what Labour strategists are banking on . Miliband's personal ratings are bleak, except on measures of decency and empathy . So those are the leadership qualities his campaign aims to project . The contrast they want to draw is between Cameron's ethical plasticity and a challenger who sticks to his beliefs . Miliband will be cast as a man guided by what David Axelrod, Barack Obama's former aide now advising Labour, calls\"a north star\" - a compass point that tells voters a leader is propelled by something more noble than the salvation of his own skin . Waverers who don't warm to Miliband(and who aren't irredeemably riddled with anti-Westminster rage) might still be persuaded that he is in politics for the right reason . The opposite is true of Cameron . Even those in his own party who like the direction of policy cannot sincerely claim that their leader is driven by much beyond a sense of entitlement to the job . That was less of an impediment in the past . For much of the 20th century, Britain was ruled by Conservatives who thought of political theory as something suspect or vulgar, a folly for continentals and socialists, and no substitute for the innate good sense drilled into English boys at the best schools . The Thatcher revolution disrupted the patrician culture in the Conservative party, but not the underlying belief that Tory rule is a default setting for British politics; the norm to which the country tends . That assumption, more than economic growth, deficit reduction, an EU referendum or any other part of the prospectus, is what makes Cameron think he can stay on after May . It is the confidence that he is an archetypal prime minister and the only credible candidate for the job . Perhaps he will be proved right . He will have money and much of the press to amplify that view . But even loyal Conservatives can't entirely ignore the intellectual void at the centre . The right has decried it as often as the left . The past five years have posed huge challenges for Britain regarding the economy, our place in Europe, England's relations with Scotland, the decline of trust in institutions . But of which encounter with a great problem can it be said the prime minister truly rose to the occasion? Cameron doesn't have big answers , he shrinks questions . And that is how history will remember him, whatever happens in May . He successfully pursued power and spent it without purpose .",

The presidency of Barack Obama will be over , and to the joy and relief of many Americans, there will be a new beginning . To quote President Obama's 2008 campaign slogan \"Hope and Change\" will be the order of the day . Certainly \"change\" will come with the new occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . The certainty of who that man or woman will be two years from now is unknown . It will depend on who can survive the already begun long campaign that will easily be the most expensive in history . Immediately after the oath of Office is taken at noon on January 20th, 2017 on the West Portal of the Capitol, the pictures on the walls of the White House and the personal artifacts of Barack Obama and his family will be removed . The legacy left behind and the permanent White House staff will stay on awaiting the new leader of the free world . \"Hope\" is always in the minds of Americans along with good will for any new president . Much of that good will and almost all of the \"hope,\" that this president could or would be different, is gone . With a little more than half of the president's second term remaining, judgments have been made and speculation is rampant that the White House decisions are now being made is to define that legacy . His expected veto decision on the Keystone pipeline is to appease the environmentalists . His executive orders allowing millions of illegals to stay in the country rather than be deported is also viewed as a pandering to the fastest growing voting group . His alteration by executive order creating changes in his health care law have enraged members of Congress that have the real power to change laws . His attempt to close Guantanamo prison over the objections of Congress is another critical debate . But the biggest and most long lasting mistake maybe his withdrawal of ground troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan . And one he has not yet made may be more severe and dangerous to world peace -- his headlong rush toward an attempt to get a nuclear deal with Iran . A deal that, in spite of all the reassurances from Secretary of State John Kerry, will enable Iran to make nuclear weapons . The mainstream media is feeding into this legacy debate . One of the latest examples, The New York magazine cover story of January 11, called the \"Obama History Project.\" The magazine asked 53 historians to weigh in on Barack Obama's legacy and how they think he will be measured 20 years from now . Historians play a vital role in measuring presidents . Usually their histories are written decades after the fact when they can go back and review documents and gather facts and see the results of presidential actions from afar and in a cold dissected view . Historians have certainly altered the view of many former presidents and have actually restored the reputations of a few . Harry Truman being a perfect example . A man greatly respected today , Truman left office with a tattered reputation, was very unpopular with the public, and could not possibly been reelected when he left office in 1952 . Today, he is ranked among the top 10 presidents by most presidential scholars . A review of Eisenhower is going on now and his marks are high . Lyndon Johnson and George Herbert Walker Bush are getting favorable reviews by the historians after being out of office for decades . I am a partisan Republican who has worked in the administrations of three presidents and served two tours of duty at the highest level of Ronald Reagan's White House . As an American and as the father of a young college-aged daughter, I don't want any president to fail . I want this country to be led by the very best people we can find . It isn't always so . Every president, or people on his staff are looking out for his legacy . But the boss I worked for, President Reagan, operated under a different theory . One day we were returning from a trip out somewhere in the country . We were flying aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, across Washington, after leaving Air Force One at Andrews Air Base . The president was very tired and as we landed on the South Lawn, he looked up at pictures of his ranch displayed on the walls of the chopper . He said, pointing to the ranch pictures,\"I wish we were landing there!\" Not knowing what to say to the leader of the free world who obviously didn't want to go back to work . I said,\"Mr  President, it will all be worthwhile. History will be very kind to you someday.\" He chuckled and said right back.\"Ed, I don't care about history. I am going to be dead and gone and they will distort it anyways. What I care about is those great young people we saw out there today and making sure they have the same opportunities we all had.\" He turned to his closest friend, also sitting there, Senator Paul Laxalt (R.-Nev .). He said Paul's father was a Basque immigrant sheepherder and his mother a hotel cook . He turned to me and said:\"Your dad was shipyard worker and my own father was a travelling shoe salesman. We are all here because this great country gave us opportunities. We have to make sure that's what we leave behind and those kids out there get those same opportunities. Now let's get back in there and go to work!\" Ronald Reagan loved this country and was proud to be the leader of the greatest group of people in the world . President Obama, that's how you build a legacy! President Obama's life story is one of inspiration . To come from a broken home, abandoned by his father as an infant, to be raised by grandparents from the Midwest and to achieve, as a black man, the highest office in the land is inspirational . Unfortunately, he has not been an inspirational president . Mr  Obama, let me speak to you directly . Right now your legacy is that your party suffered historic losses across the country at every level in 2014 . Your health care plan will cost enormous sums above your estimates and even those who didn't have health insurance and now do, can't get health care . The Dodd-Frank bill has cost American business billions of dollars and thousands of lawyers are working around the clock to deal with the implementation of it . You pulled our troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan before the job was done . And your lack of strength as a leader has made the strongest nation in the world look weak and vulnerable . You have the greatest political tin ear I've ever seen in a president . Someone should have told you to take your place at the front of the line with other world leaders in Sunday's million person march in Paris, against worldwide terrorism . Or you should have known yourself . Yes , Mr  President, they are terrorists and they hate everything we stand for . You want a legacy? Work with the Congress the American people chose and get something done!",

Considering Mexico's history and the present political context, it's no surprise that the majority of the Mexican population nowadays is either deeply suspicious of President Pena Nieto or just opposed to the current fast-track drive to privatise oil and pass it into the hands of foreign oligopolies . At present, Mexico suffers from an extremely weak state where the vast majority of crimes go unaddressed because of a judicial vacuum . More than 22,000 forced disappearances have occurred since 2007 and more than 70,000 people have been killed since 2006 . Almost every week we hear about more mass graves discovered . Most recently, a massacre of students in Iguala shook the nation . Mexico also suffers from the third largest illicit economy in the world, according to the Global Financial Integrity Report . Clearly, organised crime is openly challenging and fragmenting the state . In the face of these facts even President Nieto has admitted in public speeches that Mexico's legal system is in shambles . International experience and basic common sense indicate that a country must possess a minimum standard of the rule of law in order to be able to foster social benefits for most of its population when privatising state assets . Without functional regulatory and judicial controls, it is technically and politically not feasible for any oil-funded social development fund to effectively spread wealth to future generations through new public education programmes, a modernised public health, adequate environmental standards and a much-improved physical infrastructure . Absolutely nothing today indicates that Mexico can implement privatisation of the oil infrastructure at even the most basic standards of security, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency . Yet ,  a Mexican paradox occurs . While insecurity still runs at record highs , foreign money keeps pouring in . What's going on? Since the beginning of the still unfinished democratic transition and since the economic opening to international trade of the early 1990s, Mexico managed to attract billions of dollars per year in foreign direct investment . Yet ,  most of this money has been channelled into politically managed non-competitive sectors in the hands of Mexican \"state courtesans\" disguised as private entrepreneurs who over the last 25 years created vast oligopolies out of the privatisation of state assets . The privatisation process in Mexico has largely been conducted through dubious procedures orchestrated by corrupt federal governments . All this happened in the midst of a Mexican economy lacking technological innovation with low productivity and where more than half of what is produced and consumed is exchanged within informal/illicit markets . Nevertheless ,  these so-called private oligopolies within the mining, banking and telecommunications industries operate in a crony capitalistic fashion by attracting foreign investors to politically protected markets in which governments (through bribes and subsidies) ensure rates of return two to five times above the international average . How can, for example, German or US oligopolies presently investing in Mexico fail to fall in love with such a \"generous\" corrupt system? The forthcoming Mexican oil privatisation falls comfortably within this \"legally corrupt\" economic framework . Yet ,  harsh social realities have a way of trumping politics most of the time . Mexican writer and journalist Ana Lilia Perez published in 2012 a book titled\"The Black Cartel\" in which she provides a description of massive organised crime infiltration within the top managerial echelons of the state-run oil company, PEMEX . The nature of the organised crime infiltration covers technical and political appointees at PEMEX . Moreover ,  with thorough documentation, Ms Perez provides a detailed account of how and where a large portion of the oil extracted and distributed by PEMEX is currently stolen through illegal operations . These have been linked to Mexican politicians and US and Mexican private companies selling illegal Mexican oil to the markets in Canada, Mexico and the US, with the complicity of the Mexican armed forces supposedly responsible for protecting the PEMEX infrastructure . The current illegal oil trafficking comes with high-level political corruption, intense armed conflict causing thousands of deaths per month and frequent acts of terrorism against the PEMEX infrastructure . One cannot expect this armed conflict scenario to just go away after privatisation . In this kind of context, any honest foreign investor bidding within a Mexican oil privatisation process should have his or her head checked or otherwise possess enough political clout within Mexico or the financial capacity to bribe with millions of dollars the government ladder and pay for a vast praetorian guard of security personnel to manage the armed chaos ahead . In comparison , dealing with other oil producing countries with problematic states, such as Nigeria, would seem like a walk in the park . Shareholders of oil companies can only expect low economic returns and chaos from investing in the Mexican oil sector , unless , prior to any private investment drive, an international judicial cooperation effort starts dismantling the vast organised crime networks within the Mexican oil business and beyond . This international judicial cooperation must entail the actual implementation of a serious anti-corruption programme within the Mexican state with much broader conflict of interest and traffic of influence statutes, all monitored by reputable international civil society organisations . Furthermore ,  the failure of the Mexican state needs to be corrected with the installation of autonomous investigative units for economic crimes within each Mexican region and the creation of witness protection programmes for cases of political corruption linked to organised crime . These reforms will be good for Mexican society in general and also good for the pockets of Mexican and foreign oil investors .",

            "input": "Putin and Ukraine: Expect more brutal aggression from Russia's desperate leader. The renewal of fighting this week over the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine- an important symbolic target for Russian proxy fighters-- should come as no surprise . The U.S  and Western Europe should expect even more extensive Russia-directed attacks . Why? Because of the choice Vladimir Putin made five years ago, confirmed on his reelection in 2012 - and is continuing to make . After Russia's GDP plunged by almost 8 percent during the 2008-9 world financial crisis , there was a virtual consensus among Russian economists that Putin's economic model, which depended on the redistribution of revenues from ever-increasing oil prices, along with growing state control over the economy and rampant corruption, was nearly exhausted . Russia needed to \"modernize and diversify,\" as the catch words among such thinkers went . But to do so, the country first and foremost had to \"improve the investment climate.\" That was a euphemism for tapering off the state's grip on the economy; getting rid of bureaucratic shakedowns of private businesses; ensuring that courts were no longer for sale or open to \"instructions\" from authorities; strengthening private property rights; and eventually decentralizing and liberalizing the political system . In short ,  deep institutional reforms . These were advocated by, among others, Alexei Kudrin, Putin's personal friend and confidant, former finance minister and former first deputy prime minister . Kudrin was to be a disappointed man . While paying lip service to \"modernization,\" the Kremlin did nothing to advance that agenda . Two years later, Russia was shaken by pro-democracy, anti-Putin demonstrations in all of Russia's largest cities . Putin got the same message that almost every authoritarian leader gets sooner or later : reform and democratize to improve the economy or tighten the screws of repression to deal with discontent . We all know what Putin did . Upon his presidential reelection in 2012, he issued a slew of laws constraining already limited freedoms of public protest and speech . The consequences came quickly: even with oil prices over $100 per bbl, growth dwindled to a crawl and capital flight reached record levels . By the end of 2013, Putin's popularity was at lowest point in 13 years . Around half of Russians did not want to see him as president again in 2018 . Yet Putin doubled down once more, using another tried-and-true authoritarian tool: manufactured nationalist patriotic frenzy mixed with paranoia and served up by deafening propaganda . The anti-corruption, pro-European revolution in Ukraine was presented as an American plot against Russia . Following the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, those who opposed the regime were labelled the \"fifth column\" and \"national traitors.\" Then came war in Ukraine -- aggression by proxy or, last fall, by uniformed Russian troops . The daily poisoning of Russian hearts and minds on state-controlled national television is now beginning to surpass even Soviet totalitarianism . Western democracies are portrayed as Russia's mortal enemies , who seek to undermine Moscow's sovereignty and enslave its people . This Stalinist-style propaganda is designed to justify the Kremlin's aggression against Ukraine, excuse increasing domestic repression, explain away mounting economic hardships and-- most troubling-- perhaps prepare the country for possible aggression against other neighbors . Both in his end-of-year press-conference and in his New Year's message to the nation, Putin fixed the propaganda pitch to the highest point :. \"We are defending our independence, our sovereignty and our right to exist,\" he declared . \"We need to accomplish, to realize all that we planned- for ourselves, for the sake of our children, and for the sake of Russia.\" After this, can anyone expect the Russian commander-in-chief to go wobbly on foreign enemies or to abandon ethnic \"brethren\" fighting against an allegedly genocidal \"Nazi junta\"-- known to the rest of the world as the elected government in Kiev? U.S  and European diplomats keep talking about providing Russia with an \"off ramp.\" Judging by Putin's rhetoric, there is no ramp high enough for the task . So long as Putin sticks with the anti-reform choice , escalation appears to be his only tactic for staying in and consolidating power . This choice preceded the drop in oil prices and Western sanctions - and it will outlive them as well . The West should expect no magic turn-around and prepare to confront but also engage with this Russia over the long haul .",

            "input": "Putin and Erdogan: Partnership of convenience? The fate of the multibillion dollar project had been up in the air for a few months . Breaching EU competition rules, the pipeline project could have gone through if it had allowed access to suppliers other than Gazprom . The crisis in Ukraine and the mounting tensions gave EU policymakers an additional reason not to accommodate Russia's demands for special treatment . As a result, Putin declared that resources will be directed towards upgrading gas pipeline infrastructure linking Russia to Turkey - or even building an altogether new pipeline, in an attempt to save face and offset the losses incurred over South Stream . This decision underscores the pragmatism in the way Moscow and Ankara deal with each other . Meetings and official phone conversations between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, more than 35 over the past few years, usually follow a very similar script . The two leaders agree to disagree on the ongoing human tragedy in Syria, where they sit on opposing sides, and proceed with bilateral business . This time around, they made the usual pledge to triple the volume of trade between the two countries from the current figure of $33bn to $100bn by the end of this decade . That might be an ambitious target but one should not forget that Russia is already Turkey's second largest trading partner after Germany . It is, furthermore, the second biggest market for Russian gas exports outside the former Soviet Union, with Germany again the frontrunner . Turkish construction firms have carved out a niche in the Russian market , benefiting handsomely from large public-funded project such as the Sochi Winter Olympics . This explains why Erdogan was deaf to calls for Turks of Circassian origin to boycott the games , which were set in the part of the Caucasus they were uprooted from back in the 1860s . Currently, there is a problem with gas deliveries over the Trans-Balkan pipeline to western Turkey via Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria , because of disruptions due to the constant wrangling between Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftohaz . If the winter is harsh , heating in Istanbul and other large cities in the Marmara region will suffer . That is not a welcome prospect for the Turkish government , which is heading for general elections in the first half of 2015 and is therefore determined to avoid such unpleasant shocks and also keep gas prices low . High-ranking Russian representatives, including Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller, who was in Ankara last week, promise to step up volumes through the Blue Stream, the pipeline connecting the Russian grid to central Anatolia via the Black Sea, and reach a total of 30 billion cubic metres in 2014, from 25.6 billion cubic metres the previous year . In this context, it makes perfect sense that investment should be redirected from the botched South Stream project to the upgrade of Blue Stream . In the long run, Ankara would also like to move away from dependence on Russia and tap into new gas flowing from Azerbaijan - via the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) coming onstream in 2019 - Northern Iraq, Iran and, should a solution be reached on the Cyprus Issue, the Eastern Mediterranean . The AKP government has helped decrease imports from Russia to 57 percent of the overall volume , but in absolute terms, consumption in an expanding economy like Turkey's is only going higher . Luckily, the plummeting prices of oil have come as a huge bonus to the government , reducing Turkey's bill and improving the balance of payments vis-a-vis Russia . What Turkey is offering in exchange is neutrality in Putin's confrontation with the West . Ankara has a lot of reasons to be unhappy about the annexation of Crimea, home to a large Tatar community which views Turkey as a kin state, and about the frozen conflict in Eastern Ukraine . Yet ,  unlike all other members of NATO, it has declined to join the sanctions imposed on Russia (imports of Turkish poultry and seafood have rocketed since) . The strategic value of Turkey's neutrality has only gone up after Putin found himself shouldered aside by most emerging powers at the recent G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia . Russia has long encouraged Turkey's pursuit of an autonomous foreign policy and emancipation from NATO and the US . As the Turkish city of Antalya hosts the next G20 summit , there will be a renewed emphasis on Turkey's transformation into a global leader rather than a pliant western periphery . But geopolitical gains may not give Russia sufficient incentive to accommodate Turkish demands . Putin came with a delegation of 10 government ministers and a shopping list too . He would like to see progress on Rosatom's $20bn project to build Turkey's first nuclear power station at Akkuyu near Mersin . Construction work is expected to start in May , but reportedly Putin has insisted on a preferential treatment for the Russian state company by the Turkish tax authorities . It seems, however , that Erdogan has held his ground this time around and Rosatom has not obtained what it wanted . Though Putin's visit will be remembered for the South Stream announcement , what is most remarkable about it is the continued development of Russian- Turkish relations, amid mounting tensions between Putin and the West .",

            "input": "What the Quran says about the mighty pen. Muslims - in theory - have traditions that value the power of the pen . Islam was revealed to save people from bloodshed and misuse of the sword . That is a paraphrasing of the cardinal's line in one of the Acts of Edward Bulwer-Lytton 1839 play \"Richelieu\" . The origin of the timeless adage is thought to have originated in Assyrian wisdom - like Islam, moral and value systems of Middle Eastern descent . However ,  the moral, intellectual and ethical systems of that region - including those carried through dialogue with Hellenic ideas in the first three centuries of Islam - have all been subjected to obscurantist and literalist interpretations of revelation . Islam's first command to the Prophet Muhammad was to \"read\" ; \"Read in the name of thy Lord.\" Chapter 68 in the Quran is named \"Al-Qalam\" (the pen) . It opens up with the verse:\"By the pen and what they inscribe.\" In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen ; \"Who taught by the pen. Taught mankind that which he knew not\"(96:4-5) . So it should be natural for Muslims today to feel total empathy towards fellow writers and journalists and the families of other victims in France . Especially in solidarity against the cowardly slaying of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and cartoonists . Reading and writing belong to the \"genus\" of cross-disciplinary activities Islam insists upon repeatedly . Reading, writing and reasoning are all part and parcel of the way of life Islam is all about . In Chapter 55 we find \"Allah - Most Gracious! It is He Who has taught the Quran. He has created man. He has taught him eloquence [intelligence]\" (55:1-4) . The didactic ethos of numerous Quranic injunctions on the pen, knowing and reasoning, seem to be lost today in the heap of ignorance and obscurantism that is consuming many a Muslim land . Lands where scholars of Islam underwrite political power at the expense of freedom of speech and a rational interpreting of the Quran that delivers Muslims from the yoke of oppression that is consuming Muslim youth and pleads the case of social justice, freedom of thought and tolerance . The sad state of the violence that today engulfs Muslim cities, pitting Muslim against Muslim, is in no small measure the result of the over-politicisation and over-securitisation of Islam . Whole states are disintegrating , and religious and sectarian intolerance is ushering in a horrible era of annihilation and self-destruction . Islam never began with jihad (a holy war) . The miracle of the Prophet Muhammad is that he knew when to retreat(via Hijra or emigration) to build values of solidarity, peaceful coexistence with all kinds of \"otherness\" (such as in Medina and hostile Arab tribes), create know-how, and voluntarism in faith and membership of community, along with moderation (\"wasatiyya\") . Quran is the word for \"reading\" . Those Muslims who, in cold blood, killed French journalists and cartoonists, supposedly to \"avenge the prophet\" miss the point about the prophet's ways . That includes the injunctions that \"Verily, this Quran guides [human beings] to that which is most just\"(17:9), and\"If anyone took a life unless it be for murder and spreading injustice in the land, it would be as if he killed mankind entirely\" (5:32) . Satire, criticism, and cartoons will never caricature the grand stature of the prophet nor diminish the sacredness of the Quran to Muslims and billions of tolerant human beings who share countries, ideologies or friendships with hundreds of millions of Muslims . Denigration comes from the savagery of heinous violence and Manichean ways many self-professed learned scholars of Islam or self-serving politicians knowingly and unknowingly are pushing trusting Muslim youth and entire nations towards the abyss . France has historically accommodated millions of Muslims who fled poverty, marginalisation and even oppression . Many of those come from North Africa where Maghreb countries have benefited not only from remittances, but also from a vast shared space in which Muslims, Christians and Jews have learnt the art of toleration of differences . What the murder of innocents in Paris has done is inflame inter-communal trust , and like the 9/11 attacks in the US 14 years ago, it has placed Muslims in the awkward position of being either unwelcome among host communities or defending Islam . This is because of the insane acts of co-religionists whose Islam is fixated on the \"sword\" and has little to do with the might of the \"pen\" that over millennia Muslim luminaries used to connect with others, and spread knowledge - not sow death .",

            "input": "The real American Sniper was a hate-filled killer. Why are simplistic patriots treating him as a hero? I have to confess : I was suckered by the trailer for American Sniper . It's a masterpiece of short-form tension - a confluence of sound and image so viscerally evocative it feels almost domineering . You cannot resist . You will be stressed out . You will feel . Or , as I believe I put it in a blog about the trailer , \"Clint Eastwood's American Sniper trailer will ruin your pants.\" But however effective it is as a piece of cinema, even a cursory look into the film's backstory - and particularly the public reaction to its release - raises disturbing questions about which stories we choose to codify into truth, and whose, and why, and the messy social costs of transmogrifying real life into entertainment . Chris Kyle, a US navy Seal from Texas, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and claimed to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career . In his memoir, Kyle reportedly described killing as \"fun\", something he \"loved\" ; he was unwavering in his belief that everyone he shot was a \"bad guy\" . \"I hate the damn savages,\" he wrote . \"I couldn't give a flying fuck about the Iraqis.\" He bragged about murdering looters during Hurricane Katrina , though that was never substantiated . He was murdered in 2013 at a Texas gun range by a 25-year-old veteran reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . However we diverge politically, I have enough faith in Eastwood's artistry and intellect to trust that he is not a black-and-white ideologue - or, at least, that he knows that the limitations of such a worldview would make for an extremely dull movie . But the same can't be said for Eastwood's subject, or, as response to the film has demonstrated, many of his fans . As Laura Miller wrote in Salon:\"In Kyle's version of the Iraq war, the parties consisted of Americans, who are good by virtue of being American, and fanatic Muslims whose 'savage, despicable evil' led them to want to kill Americans simply because they are Christians.\" Adds Scott Foundas at Variety:\"Chris Kyle saw the world in clearly demarcated terms of good and evil, and American Sniper suggests that such dichromatism may have been key to both his success and survival; on the battlefield, doubt is akin to death.\" Eastwood, on the other hand, Foundas says, \"sees only shades of gray\" , and American Sniper is a morally ambiguous, emotionally complex film . But there are a lot of Chris Kyles in the world , and the chasm between Eastwood's intent and his audience's reception touches on the old Chappelle's Show conundrum: a lot of white people laughed at Dave Chappelle's rapier racial satire for the wrong reasons, in ways that may have actually exacerbated stereotypes about black people in the minds of intellectual underachievers . Is that Chappelle's fault? Should he care? Likewise, much of the US right wing appears to have seized upon American Sniper with similarly shallow comprehension - treating it with the same unconsidered, rah-rah reverence that they would the national anthem or the flag itself . Only a few weeks into its release, the film has been flattened into a symbol to serve the interests of an ideology that, arguably, runs counter to the ethos of the film itself . How much, if at all, should Eastwood concern himself with fans who misunderstand and misuse his work? If he, intentionally or not, makes a hero out of Kyle- who, bare minimum, was a racist who took pleasure in dehumanising and killing brown people- is he responsible for validating racism, murder, and dehumanisation? Is he a propagandist if people use his work as propaganda? That question came to the fore last week on Twitter when several liberal journalists drew attention to Kyle's less Oscar-worthy statements . \"Chris Kyle boasted of looting the apartments of Iraqi families in Fallujah,\" wrote author and former Daily Beast writer Max Blumenthal . \"Kill every male you see,\" Rania Khalek quoted, calling Kyle an \"American psycho\" . Retaliation from the rightwing twittersphere was swift and violent, as Khalek documented in an exhaustive (and exhausting) post at Alternet . \"Move your America hating ass to Iraq, let ISIS rape you then cut your cunt head off, fucking media whore muslim,\" wrote a rather unassuming-looking mom named Donna . \"Rania, maybe we to take you ass overthere and give it to ISIS... Dumb bitch,\" offered a bearded man named Ronald , who enjoys either bass fishing or playing the bass (we may never know) . \"Waterboarding is far from torture,\" explained an army pilot named Benjamin, all helpfulness . \"I wouldn't mind giving you two a demonstration.\" The patriots go on, and on and on . They cannot believe what they are reading . They are rushing to the defence of not just Kyle, but their country, what their country means . They call for the rape or death of anyone ungrateful enough to criticise American hero Chris Kyle . Because Chris Kyle is good, and brown people are bad, and America is in danger, and Chris Kyle saved us . The attitude echoes what Miller articulated about Kyle in her Salon piece : \"his steadfast imperviousness to any nuance, subtlety or ambiguity, and his lack of imagination and curiosity, seem particularly notable\" . There is no room for the idea that Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy; or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; or a complex guy in a bad war who convinced himself he loved killing to cope with an impossible situation; or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive system that, yes, also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial- killer people to do oppressive things over which they have no control . Or that Iraqis might be fully realised human beings with complex inner lives who find joy in food and sunshine and family, and anguish in the murders of their children . Or that you can support your country while thinking critically about its actions and its citizenry . Or that many truths can be true at once . Always meet your heroes .",

In his State of the Union address, President Obama will propose much he knows the Republican-controlled Congress will not enact , but his real agenda is to set the table for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign . Once again, the president will propose soaking the rich with higher estate, capital gains and bank taxes, while adding to entitlements for the working poor and middle class--new tax credits, higher child care allowance and more college tuition assistance . It all sounds appealing in an economy where the top 10 percent have done quite well , while the rest struggle -- but it is not that simple . The president will argue the economy--and especially the rich-- can afford the taxes he wants because economic growth is so strong -- but that's a fib . Since the recovery began, GDP growth has averaged a mere 2.3 percent a year -- that's about half what Ronald Reagan accomplished climbing out of a recession of comparable depth . Now the recovery faces tough headwinds . Falling oil prices are curbing drilling in places like North Dakota and Texas , and big layoffs are not far behind . The dollar is quite strong against other currencies, limiting exports and boosting job-killing imports , because China's growth is faltering , Japan remains in neutral and Europe is on the edge of collapse under the weight of statism -- the very kind Obama and Clinton want to impose on Americans . The president proposes to legislate the basic contract between employers and workers . On top of higher minimum wages and mandated business financed health benefits, he wants employers to pay for mandatory sick leave and six weeks of paid parental leave . After five years, Reagan increased employment by 9.4 percent , whereas Obama has boosted jobs only 4.5 percent . Consequently , nearly one in six prime working age men between 25 and 54 is not working , and 72 percent of those are not even bothering to look . Obama has made Medicaid, food stamps and social security disability quite easy to get , and idle men form a new leisure class by combining those benefits with handouts from relatives and girlfriends . For employers, a higher minimum wage, compulsory health insurance, and sick and parental leave will make those men even more costly to hire . Enter stage left , more worker replacing robots . The number of young people--and especially young men--starting small businesses has fallen dramatically -- and that means fewer jobs over the next generation for everyone . Young folks start enterprises by raising a lot of capital from older rich people . Wealthy folks take the plunge on risky ventures , because the capital gains tax on successful enterprises is currently taxed at about 25 percent , whereas combined federal, state and local tax rates on ordinary income is often above 50 percent . Young entrepreneurs, who generally have not amassed much wealth, can't borrow nearly what they need from banks . Higher taxes on banks will make that problem worse . Hiking capital gains taxes will directly discourage older successful investors , who also bring a wealth of practical management experience and advice for getting young ventures off the ground . Older rich folks also take the plunge , because they can pass along assets at death to their children . But now the president wants to hike the tax rate on their estates , which is already 40 percent . The president calls it fair because it only falls on one percent of the population, and will paint Republicans who resist as defending the rich to the detriment of struggling Americans . His aim is to give Americans buyer's remorse about electing a Republican Congress and boost a Clinton campaign for the White House emphasizing similar themes . It would seem one out of six men unemployed, subsisting on government benefits and burdening relatives is not too high a price to elect another Democratic president .",

Friday, January 16 is Religious Freedom Day, a celebration of one of the powerful and unique freedoms within our nation's founding and fabric . In 1992, the House and Senate joined together to pass a resolution designating January 16th as Religious Freedom Day . This day is based on the anniversary of the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Thomas Jefferson . Congress formally recognized that the \"Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom inspired and shaped the guarantees of religious freedom in the First Amendment.\" President George H  W  Bush issued the first proclamation in 1992 , noting that \"American law and institutions have been shaped by a view of man that recognizes the inherent rights and dignity of individuals.\" For the last 24 years, each president has made an annual declaration and encouraged Americans to \"observe this day through appropriate events and activities in homes, schools, and places of worship.\" To better understand the Founder's intent for this precious right, we must return to the actual text of the 1786 statute . Most notably, it reads:\"... no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced ...in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\" The Founders understood that there is a direct connection between the prosperity and health of a nation and its respect for human rights and religious freedom . Individual faith grows when people live free of government coercion and control . In America, any person can live their faith or choose to have no faith; in many parts of the world that simple truth is revolutionary . This fundamental right at the core of our nation allows the United States to champion religious freedom around the world . Our own State Department's Office of International Religious Freedom appropriately reinforces this value by saying, \"Given the U.S  commitment to religious freedom, and to the international covenants that guarantee it as the inalienable right of every human being, the United States seeks to: Promote freedom of religion and conscience throughout the world as a fundamental human right and as a source of stability for all countries.\" Over the last few years, there have been many heated conversations in our own country about the role of religious freedom in our society, like pubic prayer, abortion, college campus organization, religious symbols, and many others . Last summer's Supreme Court decision affirming the right to live and work in accordance with one's convictions was contentious , but the High Court reinforced the right of Americans to not just have a faith, but to actually enter the marketplace and practice that faith as well . Religion that is contained only within a church building is a weekend hobby, not a personal faith . Our nation's Founders fled from a regime of religious persecution , sacrificing their lives to birth a new place of liberty . They not only believed that religious freedom was fundamental to shape this new nation, but that religious freedom was a fundamental human right for all . As we celebrate and recognize religious freedom today , let us reflect and remember that it has served as an important pillar of this nation from the start . For America to maintain its greatness, Washington must honor and prioritize religious freedom in public policy, as well as in culture . Our nation has not grown past freedom of faith, in many ways we have grown because of our freedom of faith .",

Poland's recent local elections went according to the usual script: The ruling coalition of the Civic Platform and Polish People's Party retained their control over major cities . But there was one political surprise in the final results . The urban movement, which ran for the first time in elections as a nationwide coalition of city activists, won the mayor's seat in Gorzow Wielkopolski, in western Poland, and a number of city council seats in big cities like Warsaw, Poznan and Torun . Although a newcomer to the electoral race, the urban movement dictated the direction of most election campaigns . Their demands ended up in the electoral programmes of mainstream political parties , which scrambled to attract grassroot activists on their lists to capture the youth leftist vote . So what is this new political force and can it permanently transform Polish local and state politics? In late 2007, a group of residents of the Rataje district in Poznan, in western Poland, organised to defend their right to have a say in the planning of their neighbourhood . The mayor of Poznan and the city council, had proposed to transform the derelict post-industrial zone of the neighbourhood into a new residential and commercial area . Local residents, on the other hand, insisted on building a park and a recreational area . They mobilised the community, organised protests, wrote petitions and publicised the issue in the media . The negative publicity made the situation uncomfortable enough for local officials to concede to public pressure and withdraw their commercial development proposal . This was the first sign that a new social force was emerging with the potential to affect urban policies in Poland through civic engagement . Grassroot activities began to surface in other Polish cities around that time . Activists from Sopot in northern Poland started calling for participatory budgeting following the model of the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre . In Lodz, in central Poland, an informal group of active citizens organised themselves around the issue of cleanliness of public spaces . Gradually, these groups merged into a movement calling for citizen participation in the transformation of the post-industrial area of the city, just like in Poznan . Lodz used to be an important industrial centre up until 1989 when its textile industry collapsed and many industrial buildings lay abandoned and derelict . In Warsaw, urban activists organised demonstrations for the preservation of green areas in the centre of the Polish capital; against hikes in public transport fees,;and against privatisation of municipal buildings . In the last few years, groups like Right to the City, Inhabitants' Forum, and the Housing Movement have emerged in almost every Polish town bringing together individuals of various ages, social, and cultural backgrounds . These groups were involved in a variety of campaigns to reassert residents' rights to their neighbourhoods and towns: from writing petitions, to organising protests, pickets and demonstrations, to occupying vacant buildings, setting up squats and blocking evictions . Their political appetite grew with time . In 2010, Poznan activists formed:\"We, the Inhabitants of Poznan,\" social electoral committee to contest local elections . They received almost 10 percent of the votes , but with an electoral law favouring big political parties, they failed to get a seat on the council . This electoral experience facilitated the launching, in 2011, of an informal coalition - the Urban Movements Congress - comprising urban activist groups from all over Poland . The congress was tasked with formulating a programme to provide a common foundation around which urban activists would build their campaigns in local communities . The programme was focused on three main pillars: policies to stem and reverse the growth of socioeconomic inequalities and exclusion; sustainable environment-conscious urban development in the interest of all residents; and promotion of direct democracy practices such as social consultations, participatory budgeting and referendums . After the founding of the congress, the urban movements grew in strength and impact . On the national level, the congress managed to pressure the Ministry of Regional Development to include some of its policies in its 2012 National Urban Policy (NUP) programme . On the local level, urban activists managed to reap a number of victories . In 2011, after much \"harassment\" from activists, the mayor of Sopot agreed to implement participatory budgeting in the city . Residents now can decide on how to spend 5 million zlotys (about $1.6m) or one percent of the municipal budget . Other mayors soon followed suit . In Lodz, residents decide on how to spend 40 million zlotys ($13m) . The mayor of Lodz also invited local activists to advise the city council's Revitalisation Bureau on specific policies for the socioeconomic development of the city . The reason why Lodz became more accepting of the urban movement's demands was because its previous mayor was removed in a popular referendum in January 2010 . The mayors of Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Elblag, Bytom and Ostroda were also removed in the same manner for introducing policies regarding privatisation and commercial development which went against the will of their electorates . The same fate threatened the mayor of Warsaw , but the low turnout at the referendum saved her . After surviving in her post, she quickly implemented some of the urban movement's demands . But the most spectacular achievement of the Polish urban movement in recent months was putting Krakow's candidacy to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games to a referendum . After it was announced in November 2013 that local authorities had decided to put forward Krakow's candidacy for the Olympics, activists launched a campaign called Krakow Against Games , which aimed to inform people of the negative consequences of hosting big sporting event . City authorities caved in under popular pressure and put the decision to a referendum, with the condition that it has at least a 30 percent turnout . Knowing that the 2010 EU elections had only a 26 percent turnout , they combined the referendum with the 2014 EU elections . To the displeasure of local authorities, some 36 percent of Krakow's citizens voted and 70 percent of those said no to the games . Victory of the Krakow Against Games campaign showed that referendums can be an important tool in bringing local policies in line with residents' will and that urban activists have considerable social support . The Krakow victory gave impetus to the formation by of nationwide coalition of 12 sociopolitical entities affiliated with the Urban Movements Congress to contest the 2014 local elections . The results of the election demonstrated that the movement can translate its grassroot support into electoral victories . With the 2015 parliamentary and presidential elections approaching, the coalition is hopeful that it will have an even larger political impact in the coming year . The urban movement has a long way to go in order to occupy a permanent place on Poland's political map , but its public presence, successful campaigns and increasing social support show that there is a definite shift in Polish people's sociopolitical attitudes . There is clearly growing support for sustainable and environment-conscious development which aims to level out inequalities and exclusion and usher in effective practices of direct democracy .",

            "input": "Russia's next acquisition. It is no secret that Russia views the South Caucasus as being in its natural sphere of influence . In light of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on the back of Moscow's recent treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgians have legitimate reasons to believe that Russian activity in their country will only increase in 2015 . Consequently ,  many are keeping a close eye on the Georgian province of Samtskhe-Javakheti- a majority ethnically Armenian region located just three hours' drive from the nation's capital city of Tbilisi . Causing instability in Samtskhe-Javakheti would achieve two goals for Moscow . First ,  it would further dismember the territorial integrity of Georgia . The Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are already under Russian occupation . By some accounts they are closer than ever to being annexed by Moscow . An independent Samtskhe-Javakheti, or one under Russian influence, would divide Georgia down the middle . Armenian separatism in Samtskhe-Javakheti might not be as vocal as it was only a few years ago ; but there is still a fear that Moscow could easily reenergise separatist movements in the region . Secondly, and more importantly for Russia, bringing the region under Moscow's influence would make a land corridor between Russia and Armenia, via South Ossetia, one step closer . This is important because Russia maintains a sizeable military presence in Armenia . The bulk of the Russian force is based in the city of Gyumri and consists of approximately 5,000 soldiers and dozens of fighter planes and attack helicopters . Russia has long had the difficult challenge of supplying these forces , especially since Georgia and Turkey refuse transit rights . This has left a reliance on Iran , which for obvious reasons, is not ideal for Russia . It is not only for Russia that Samtskhe-Javakheti is strategically important, but also for Europe . The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus Pipeline, carrying oil and gas respectively from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, passes through the province . As the possibility of more Central Asian oil and gas finding its way to Europe becomes likely , these pipelines bypassing Russia will become a vital part of Europe's energy security . In addition ,  the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway, which is due to open later this year, passes through Samtskhe-Javakheti . It is expected that this rail line will eventually transport 3 million passengers and over 15 million tons of freight each year . There is a perfect storm brewing in the region and if Russia wanted to exploit the situation in Samtskhe-Javakheti it could not ask for better timing than now . First is the fact that many Javakheti Armenians have Russian sympathies . Until its closure in 2007, the Russian military base there was the single biggest source of employment . It has also been reportedthat Moscow is issuing Russian passports to ethnic Armenians living in the region . This in itself is telling ; Russia issued passports to Abkhazians and South Ossetians just before its 2008 invasion of Georgia and also issued passports to Crimeans ahead of the annexation of Crimea last year . But Russia is only part of the problem . Many of the grievances Javakheti Armenians have are a result of poor policy making by the central government in Tbilisi . Many Javakheti Armenians feel that their culture and language are discriminated against . There has been a decrease in the quality of education among the Javakheti Armenian population . The bilingual education program of teaching in both Georgian and Armenian has been described as a \"total failure\" because there are not enough qualified teachers with proficiency in both languages . Unemployment is high in Samtskhe-Javakheti and future economic prospects in the region look bleak . Many Javakheti Armenians travel to Russia or Armenia for work . Economy strained . Thanks to the drop in the value of the Russian ruble - almost one-third of its value in the past year  - remittances have also decreased . The unusually harsh winter in the region is placing a further strain on economic activity . Then there is the issue of citizenship and immigration . Many Javakheti Armenians do not have Georgian citizenship . Instead ,  many hold Armenian passports because finding seasonal work in Armenia and Russia is easier this way . Until recently, Armenian citizens were allowed to live and work inside Georgia without any special authorisation as long as they crossed the border back into Armenia at least once a year . Last September this changed . Now Javakheti Armenians without Georgian citizenship can only stay in Georgia for three months at a time . Longer term residency permits are costly . These policies breed animosity and form a perfect storm that could easily be exploited by Russia . It does not have to be this way . Sensible policies can be pursued by Tbilisi to address the legitimate grievances of the Javakheti Armenians . The West can make it clear to Russia that further meddling in Georgia's domestic affairs could lead to additional sanctions . The last thing the South Caucasus needs is another sectarian conflict .",

            "input": "A Russian bank and French nationalism. You have to be made of wood not to laugh at this : a private Russian bank has given a loan to France's National Front . This political party, drawn to victory by Marine Le Pen, won the recent French elections by almost three times the number of votes than President Francois Hollande . Although this is news , this wasn't the biggest media reaction of the day . Ever since the news came out that the National Front's campaign budget was allegedly funded by the First Czech-Russian Bank, accusations that \"the Kremlin is funding the far-right\" and \"supporting anti-EU parties\" have been making the rounds . This bank has been in operation since 1996 , which by Russian terms, makes it \"ancient\" as capitalism didn't really kick in until the mid-1990s in Russia . Through this, the sole owner of the bank, Roman Popov, was immediately seen as the \"oligarch who is close to the Kremlin\" . The funding, which initially started at a sum of $11m, quickly increased to $49m , purely because that is the amount of money the National Front said it needed in order to pay for its campaign leading up to the presidential elections in 2017 . With all the media hype, it seems as though people haven't picked up on the irony . When former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was running for president in 2005, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi also gave him a sum of money for his campaign . But that is not the irony ; the amount of money he gave was $49m . This doesn't appear to have crossed the minds of western hacks just yet . That is because they have their own steadfast views and refuse to deviate from them . In order to find out more, I turned to my Moscow sources for help . But first, I got in touch with the First Czech-Russian Bank . I wanted to find out what they thought about the whole fuss that has erupted around their institution . Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the staff at the bank was reluctant to comment on the loan to the National Front, citing client confidentiality . They did, however, provide me with a direct email address to get in touch with one of the deputy chairmen , who never did respond to my request for comment . Then again , if you should try to find out something somewhat unconventional from any of the private banks in the West , you'd also be met with silence or at best, claims of data protection . My sources in Moscow did a bit of their own research and told me that the First Czech-Russian Bank was actually launched on the initiative of the Czech government . At some point later on, one of the shareholders was the Russian construction company Stroitransgaz ; translated into English , the name means\"Gas Pipeline Construction\" . The current owner of the bank, Roman Popov, used to work there . While Popov was head of the Finance Department (1992-2002) , Stroitransgaz was a subcontractor for Gazprom, the giant state-owned gas and oil corporation in Russia . It was probably because of that, that western hacks came to the conclusion that Popov is\"directly linked to the Kremlin\" . The journalists' suspicions are further fuelled by the fact that Popov generally keeps a low profile and does not boast about his football club in England or his basketball team in the US or his real-estate profile , which is worth millions in Western Europe . The bank also has two representative offices; one in Prague and one in Bratislava , which would be logical if the name of your bank included the word \"Czech\" . My sources in Moscow informed me that the First Czech-Russian bank is quite a good bank and has a very decent track record , which is no mean feat for a financial institution that dates back to 1996 . It has had no substantial bail outs from the Central Bank and survived the banking crash of 2007 with flying colours . As for the owner, the best I could find out is that he has a degree in financial management and has been of late developing business beyond corporate entities and individual customers in Russia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia . No word on why he gave the go-ahead to give the loan to the National Front , but even if he did, why not? If the interest is good and the chances of getting it back are high as well , it sounds like a fair deal . Not to mention that it's a perfectly legitimate political party , which enjoys greater support than the ruling party at present . The most recent opinion poll has shown that Le Pen would win the first round of the presidential elections if they were held tomorrow . The question is, of course, did Popov bargain on all the publicity that his bank would be getting once word gets out that he has been funding an anti-EU and anti-immigration political part in France? Well, it might be that he thought that some publicity for his bank might actually attract more clients and raise his bank's profile . Let's face it , if a party gets 25 percent in the national vote , like the National Front did in the European elections this year , it means that a lot of people see it as a better bet than the other parties , which in turn means that the potential client base is substantial . In Russia itself, the National Front is not seen as\"racist\" or \"fascist\", as some sections of the French media portray it . In doing so, they seem to forget that by labelling this party as racists and fascists, they also label 25 percent of the French electorate as racists and fascists . In Russia, the National Front is considered a right-wing political party that has some sensible policies on the EU, on immigration and supports the idea of a strong French identity and closer ties with Russia . The opposition UMP - led once again by Sarkozy - incidentally, shares some of the National Front's views on immigration and the EU . Leading Russian political expert Andrey Fursov says that \"to call the National Front [headed by Marine Le Pen] a far-right or fascist party is an exaggeration and a mistake\" . \"It's a right-wing party, yes,\" he says . \"In our modern times, it's the left- wing socialists who can actually be called fascists.\" In his opinion, those who are called right-wing these days are \"realists\" who don't want Europe to be enslaved by the US and the \"Euro-bureaucracy\" . It remains to be seen whether the First Czech-Russian Bank made the right commercial move . From the point of view of PR, that is .",

            "input": "Russia is part of the solution and the problem. When it comes to Russia, I must admit, I have my biases . Political and economic developments in Russia have a direct impact on the Caucasus and particularly my own country, Armenia . The heightened tension between Russia and the West limits Armenia's ability to balance between two friendly sides while Russia's economic reversals impact Armenia's fragile economy . Not to mention what another Cold War might do to Armenia, to the region and the world . My enquiry generated a commotion in the hall and the Finnish representative, pre-empting the speaker, challenged my premise arguing that Finland's choice was of its own volition , which is not the case in Ukraine . Schussel concurred . Fair point . But in international relations, a state's \"volition\" is so often shaped and determined by perceived threats . It's called diplomacy and it requires reconciling the pursuit of national interests with regional and global peace . Finland's President Sauli Niinisto himself, in a recent interview with the Washington Post, predicted that Finland joining NATO would negatively affect relations with Russia . \"It is very obvious that if Finland joins NATO, that would undoubtedly harm our relations with Russia . You have to keep in mind that 1,300km is a long border, and you just don't keep it closed . On the contrary, it's a living border,\" Niinisto said . It's time Ukraine does the same . The world is inching towards a new Cold War and at the heart of it is Ukraine . When and what will be the last straw is hard to tell . But then it will be too late to reverse things from a point of no return . Russia today faces serious geopolitical and economic challenges . It is in direct confrontation with the West on a vision about the world order, on Ukraine, on Syria and on a great many other large and not-so-large issues . Economically, Russia is beginning to feel the aggregate impact of the West's economic sanctions , falling oil prices, the devaluation of the ruble, capital outflow and a decline in direct foreign investment . But to think that these pressures will force the Kremlin into even partial submission and to change its posture on global issues and weaken its grip on its immediate neighbourhood would be to misjudge President Vladimir Putin . It could have the exact opposite effect , as Russia's president perhaps walks his way out of this through consolidation at home and further assertiveness and intransigence abroad . In his annual State of the Nation address to parliament on December 4, Putin evoked exactly that . He called for the public's resilience in the face of hardship, and promised to continue his foreign policy in the belief in the justness of Russia's cause and greatness . Russia's(or Putin's) convictions are anchored on several real or perceived premises . Russian influence . First ,  Russia believes that the US never stopped containing Russia . Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, NATO's and the EU's borders have moved east . Russia fears that Ukraine's and Georgia's expressed desire to join both organisations, risks bringing those organisations to Russia's most vulnerable borders - to the east and the south . In his address condemning the \"pure cynicism\" of the West, he accused western governments of seeking to raise a new \"iron curtain\" around Russia and suggested that even if Crimea had not been annexed, the West would have come up with a different pretext to impose sanctions to contain Russia's resurgence . Second ,  Russia firmly believes that Americans are interventionists and falsely moralistic in their discourse . They are heavily involved in using soft power to manipulate and shape the will of the people while advocating the independence and sovereignty of states and respect of the will of those same people to determine their own future . In the same speech, Putin accused the West of meddling in Russia's internal affairs, claiming that sanctions were merely an excuse to weaken Russia . Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov charged the West with seeking regime change in Moscow . Russia has always blamed the West for its policies of interference in other countries' internal affairs, but had never before implied that it had worries of its own . As we are faced with the possibility of another Cold War and are challenged to look for ways to avoid it , it is worth looking into history's verdict on the original one . Facing a Cold War . First there are the traditionalists of the 1960s who argued that the Cold War was the direct result of Stalin's aggressive Soviet expansionism . Later on, particularly during the Vietnam War, the revisionists (William Appleman Williams) challenged that view blaming the US for the Cold War, arguing that:\"America's chief aim in the years after the war was to make sure that there was an 'open door' for American trade, and that this led the American government to try to make sure that countries remained capitalist like the United States.\" Then there were the post-revisionists (John Lewis Gaddis) in the 1970s who believed that:\"America and Russia wanted to keep the peace after the war but that conflict was caused by mutual misunderstanding, reactivity, and above all the American inability to understand Stalin's fears and need to defend himself after the war.\" The latter is the closest guide to today's problems . One of the specificities of the current period is that the West considers Russia to be both part of the solution but part of the problem as well . Indeed ,  Russia supports the separatists in Ukraine and is the only power that can influence decisions there and make the rebels listen . In Iran, Russia built the heavy water Arak nuclear power station which was perceived to be a huge problem , even as it offers to supply enriched uranium or host Iran's centrifuges as part of a solution . In Syria, Russia backs the Assad regime while it remains engaged in the political process and under certain circumstances can influence Assad's decisions . The list grows even longer if one considers the conflicts in other parts of Russia's neighbourhood . From the Moldovan to the Georgian and the Armenian- Azerbaijani conflicts, Russia has a major influence and say in the final outcomes . As a result of this duality, the line is blurred between engagement and confrontation, creating misunderstandings and uncertainties, but also opportunities for both Russia and the US . This was not the case in the East- West standoff during the Cold War . These beliefs and perceptions are both strengths and weaknesses for one side or the other . Taken together, they nullify each other . In the bigger picture, in the face of enormous global disturbances causing untold carnage and loss of life, they seem trivial . It is time that the major players look beyond history and personalities and transcend the zero-sum thinking of the past .",

Parents in Farmville, North Carolina want to know why their children were given a Common Core vocabulary assignment in an English class that promoted the Prophet Muhammad and the Islamic faith . \"It really caught me off guard,\" a Farmville Central High School student who was in the class told me . \"If we are not allowed to talk about any other religions in school - how is this appropriate?\" The Islamic vocabulary worksheet was assigned to seniors . \"I was reading it and it caught me off guard,\" the student told me . \"I just looked at it and knew something was not right- so I emailed the pages to my mom.\" \"In the following exercises, you will have the opportunity to expand your vocabulary by reading about Muhammad and the Islamic word,\" the worksheet read . The lesson used words like astute, conducive, erratic, mosque, pastoral, and zenith in sentences about the Islamic faith . CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION! \"The zenith of any Muslim's life is a trip to Mecca,\" one sentence read . For \"erratic,\" the lesson included this statement:\"The responses to Muhammad's teachings were at first erratic. Some people responded favorably, while other resisted his claim that 'there is no God but Allah and Muhammad his Prophet.\" Another section required students to complete a sentence :. \"There are such vast numbers of people who are anxious to spread the Muslim faith that it would be impossible to give a(n)___ amount.\" I spoke to one parent who asked not to be identified . She was extremely troubled by what her child was exposed to in the classroom . \"What if right after Pearl Harbor our educational system was talking about how great the Japanese emperor was?\" the parent asked . \"What if during the Cold War our educational system was telling students how wonderful Russia was?\" The parent said the material was classwork disguised as Islamic propaganda . \"It's very shocking,\" she said . \"I just told my daughter to read it as if it's fiction. It's no different than another of fictional book you've read.\" A spokesman for Pitt County Schools defended the lesson  - noting that it came from a state-adopted supplemental workbook and met the \"Common Core standards for English Language Arts.\" \"The course is designed to accompany the world literature text, which emphasizes culture in literature,\" the statement read . The problem is it's emphasizing a specific culture and religion - and the school district acknowledged there were concerns \"related to the religious nature of sentences providing vocabulary words in context.\" \"Our school system understands all concerns related to proselytizing, and there is no place for it in our instruction,\" the statement goes on to say . \"However, this particular lesson was one of many the students in this class have had and will have that expose them to the various religions and how they shape cultures throughout the world.\" I asked the school district to provide me with a copy of vocabulary worksheets that promoted the Jewish, Hindu and Christian faiths . The school district did not reply . I also asked for the past or future dates when the students would be given those vocabulary worksheets . The school district has yet to reply . The student I spoke with told me they have not had any other assignments dealing with religion- other than the one about Islam . Why is that not surprising? Based on its official statement, Pitt County Schools seems confident that the vocabulary lessons are in compliance with three Common Core standards related to literacy . If you want to look up those standards , reference CCSSELA- Literary L11-12.4. A, 12.4. D and 12.6 . Since the Common Core folks seem to be infatuated with sentence completion - let me try one out on them . Use \"Islamic\" and \"proselytizing\" in the following sentence : Somebody got their ____ hand caught in the ____ cookie jar . UPDATE : I asked the school district if there had been similar vocabulary assignments about Judaism, Christianity or other religions . I also asked for the exact dates of those assignments . Here's the reply I received from the school district :. \"The class recently finished reading Night by Elie Wiesel . As part of the study of this book, students were exposed to Judaism . I'm told that one of the next couple of lessons that will be taught in this class includes an examination of Psalm 23 as part of the lesson . Additionally ,  the workbook in question has another vocabulary lesson with words used in a passage about India's three great beliefs (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism) . Keep in mind that this workbook is just one of numerous resources used in the course . Students are exposed to various cultures, values, and beliefs through the reading of multiple types of literature, but teachers certainly aren't advocating for any of them.\" Notice how the school district dodged my question?",

Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  died young -- at age 39 -- and ever since his assassination in 1968 there has been a contest over his legacy . I've met black radicals who sneer at the national holiday celebrating his birth . They see the King holiday as white America's preference for celebrating a moderate, non-violent black leader instead of a militant, violent young Malcolm X. On the other side are critics who see the King holiday as political correctness taken to new heights . King was not a president, like Washington and Lincoln , so they ask why he is deserving of a national holiday . Blinded by racial bitterness, they suggest President Reagan signed the King holiday into law in 1983 as a token political gesture . Now a very good, emotionally powerful new movie -- \"Selma\" -- about Dr  King's historic role in the struggle for voting rights has set off a new fight over his legacy . This dramatic film by director, Ava DuVernay, will be remembered less as a record of Dr  King's greatness and more as a sign of the racial power struggles of the early 21st century . I know the real civil rights story . I've written two best-selling histories of the period . The greatest social movement of the last century belongs to all Americans . But some people prefer to play racial games . This movie fits in with the racially divisive discussion about who owns the history of the civil rights movement . It fits with polarizing racial figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton . They regularly exploit the history of the civil rights movement for their own personal gain  -- hosting television shows and getting money from corporations -- while not doing the hard work of addressing high rates of black crime, school dropouts and family breakdown . It is also fits with many white politicians who blame the poor for every problem and find it easy to push minority voters out of their districts while ignoring the nation's history of denying black people the right to vote . Now a version of the same race hustle is on display in Hollywood . To celebrate King as a hero, the director, who is black decided to make President Lyndon Johnson into a white villain . In one scene Johnson erupts in anger at Dr  King, telling the civil rights leader,\"You've got one big issue, I've got one hundred and one.\" People who were in the room, black and white aides to the president and Dr  King, say no such confrontation ever happened . The movie also has Johnson approving of FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover's scheme to send Dr  King's wife an audio recording of her husband having sex with another woman . The historical record is clear . Yes, the tape is real . No, Johnson had nothing to do it . And the tape had nothing to do with events in Selma . All of that is what Bill Moyers called\"the worst kind of creative license suggesting the very opposite of the truth.\" And when the director, DuVernay, was called on the distortion, she said people who care about history are the problem . She argued that crediting Johnson with supporting the Selma march was \"jaw-dropping and offensive\" and amounted to ignoring \"black citizens who made it so.\" To her, the fact that Johnson explicitly endorsed the idea of taking the movement to Selma in a recorded phone call to Dr  King is just a nuisance . White directors have similarly distorted civil rights history . The 1988 film \"Mississippi Burning\" featured two heroes, both white and both FBI agents . That was an incredible distortion of a story about the bravery of civil rights workers who dared to go south to stand with beleaguered black heroes against racial oppression . In truth, the FBI was often in league with local police departments in covering up racially motivated murder . In 1988 that distortion was rationalized as a smart box office decision to offer white heroes to white audiences . Now that a black director has a chance to make Hollywood's first big movie about Dr  King, she sees it as time for payback and her own brand of distortion . Race retains a powerful grip on American guilt, fear, lust and anger . That's why controlling the narrative is so important . And the key to the narrative is in the facts of slavery, legal segregation and the fight for equal rights . That is why facts about Dr  King are subject to a constant power struggle . DuVernay is saying she will tell her story as a black story for black audiences with a black hero , and she will twist facts as she pleases . Mark Twain said:\"Get your facts first, then you can distort them as much as you please.\" The facts are that mostly white students went south for Freedom Summer ; white ministers and rabbis took great risks and even died for the cause ; white government officials like John Doar and Nicholas Katzenbach put themselves between racist mobs and black people . None of this diminishes the contributions of black people . The truth is that President Johnson worked to make the movement a success . The president famously brought tears to Dr  King's eyes in 1965 when he told a joint session of Congress and a television audience of 70 million that every American should stand up for equal voting rights . \"Their cause must be our cause, too,\" the president said . \"Because it's not just Negroes, but it's really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.\" And then , in a rhetorical crescendo, the president said:\"And we shall overcome.\" He used a phrase that told the nation he was on the side of civil rights for black people . As the author of a history of the civil rights movement, \"Eyes on the Prize -- America's Civil Rights Years,\" I've done enough research to know that any fair account of the great social movement has to acknowledge Lyndon Baines Johnson as a civil rights hero . And Dr  King doesn't need to have anyone put down so he can look heroic . He really is a hero . That's a fact .",

Cam-to- cam sessions with strangers in Rio (or Hull) Xtube videos of faceless, face- sitting civil servants . Can I take your number, asks modern Britain , I'll send you a six-minute film of me masturbating . We're all porn stars now . Technology hasn't merely flung off religion's centuries-long chastity belt but also provided live footage of people in suburban bedrooms flinging off chastity belts, metaphorically and literally . Google it . You'll be horrified by their choice of curtains . The pornification of contemporary life is so vast and so sudden we have had no time to quantify it, or even behold it . But there is deepening concern that the reduction and commodification of human beings to mere body parts - walking, talking sex toys- is having a greater effect on gay men . Russell T Davies, a screenwriter of remarkable gifts who does not so much hold a mirror up to societal sensibilities as kick them into our retinas, thinks so . He straddles the subject in his latest, much heralded gay dramas: Cucumber, Banana and Tofu . In an interview with the Radio Times he worries that texting penis pictures \"is the most normal thing in the world\" among gay men, with bleak consequences . \"That's the grammar! That's flirting! That's extraordinary, isn't it? That's got to create body pressures, hasn't it?\" he added . It certainly will not help, nestled in an increasingly narcissistic wider culture that glistens puddle-deep as we regard our reflections . But how much we should worry, and how grave the impact is on gay people - already suffering worse mental health - depends on how closely we frame Davies' perspective . If gay people existed only online or on phones  - deriving their sense of self wholly from reactions to their online sex ads- then yes, this could be catastrophic . But they do not . And if we pan out and rewind to the gay scene of the early 90s, before Davies' Queer as Folk awoke middle England to the wonders of rimming , gay life was no less harsh . I was 16 and skinny when I first stepped into a gay bar in 1993 . Before websites and phone apps, pubs and clubs were much more sexualised than today . No amount of online objectification compares to, say, the Brief Encounter, a long narrow bar in central London, in which one could consider it an achievement to order a pint without a stranger's finger inserting itself somewhere . The other great difference was the message blaring out across gay culture : you are only desirable if you are an Adonis - a \"Muscle Mary\": no pecs, no sex . Many felt unwelcome, inadequate . It was, say some, a reaction to the extreme wasting suffered by thousands during the Aids crisis . I remember the dire contrast - a crowd of pumped-up tits and, in the corner, a wheelchair cradling a still-breathing skeleton . People turned away in terror . And then ran to the gym . Now , thanks to mobiles and the internet, there is a new message : different body shapes are desirable . Plump, hairy bear? There is a market for you . Older? Click here . Skinny? Hipsters are waiting for you . Yes , if you spend mere moments on Grindr or Scruff you will find a QC, a builder or a nurse reduced to a thumbnail fuck-me photo (it's all terribly dignified) , but there is at least some appreciation of diversity . Progress bumbles , faltering before forging ahead . This happened with gay rights , and it will happen with gay culture . Many might sext but will also consider what it means and how it feels . The wellbeing and mental health of LGBT people has never been so prominent in conversation - just as relevant services are cut . We are, at last, contemplating the internal damage from homophobic hostility . It is no wonder we crave distraction . We just need to put our phones down long enough to ask for support, for such services to be reinstated, and to ask those who bully, degrade and derail equality: why do you hate us? They are often easy to find . They're the married ones lurking in gay chat rooms with their faces concealed .",

            "input": "The rights of sex workers. In a case brought by three sex workers, the Supreme Court of Canada, in December 2013, struck down three provisions of the Canadian prostitution law , because they violated sex workers' human and \"constitutional right to security of the person\" by imposing \"dangerous conditions on prostitution\" . In June 2014, the Canadian government introduced a new prostitution law, Bill C-36 \"Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act\", which entered into force on December 5 . While the Supreme Court had created the space for a radical change in the approach to sex work by reaffirming that human and constitutional rights apply to sex workers too , democratic procedures in Canada seem to have failed sex workers . The Canadian Pivot Legal Society argues that Bill C-36 has been \"consistently misrepresented\" and that it \"will result in sweeping criminalisation of the sex industry\", including sex workers themselves . Others have called it a \"hate law\" , because the safety and security of sex workers was, in fact, not the priority for some who voted for the Bill C-36 . One of the Senators, Donald Plett, clearly stated his priority in this regard:\"We don't want to make life safe for prostitutes; we want to do away with prostitution.\" Canada is not the only state that has passed questionable legislation on sex work . \".[S]tates frequently deny sex workers the same human and legislative rights and protections afforded to other workers and citizens,\" says sex work researcher Jay Levy . The question is: How do human rights apply to sex workers and what laws and policies should states make? How should sex work laws look like, if human rights are to be respected to the fullest extent? The answer to these questions is controversial - both philosophically and politically . In the past year, numerous countries have put sex work policies on their political agenda - for different reasons and with different goals and outcomes . There are numerous examples worldwide, where the courts have upheld sex workers' human rights and questioned existing prostitution laws or filled legal grey areas . In New Zealand, where sex work is decriminalised, a sex worker won a case for sexual harassment against a brothel owner . In New York, 1,900 strip club dancers won a labour rights case against their employer , who will have to pay them at least $10m in compensation . Recently an Austrian court has ruled that the cost of forced health checks imposed on sex workers had to be reimbursed . Both in Germany and in Austria, court rulings abolished to notion of prostitution as being \"immoral\" , thus opening up the space for legal reform and the recognition of sex work as work . The European Court of Justice has repeatedly ruled that \"prostitution\" is an \"economic activity\" and that within the European Union member states cannot restrict \"freedom of movement\", not even for sex workers . While court rulings are useful and necessary in reminding us that sex workers have rights too , relying solely on courts to read human rights into existing legislation cannot be the sole answer to injustices that sex workers face . Democracies need to step in to make laws that actually improve sex workers' lives - a goal that has proven difficult to reach . Historically marginalised and stigmatised, sex workers have a hard time in pushing for a reform of prostitution laws . Most politicians, especially if male and heterosexual, do not wish to be associated with sex work . Prejudices and lack of knowledge about the topic as well as the unwillingness to engage with sex workers themselves have proven to be hard obstacles to surmount . Often, sex workers are heard in consultation processes , but their views and political claims aren't always taken seriously . By contrast, anti-prostitution activists calling for a world without prostitution have been far more successful in their lobbying efforts against sex work . They also explicitly distance themselves from self-identified sex workers , who they often accuse of being nothing but criminals . Using the stigma of sex work , anti-prostitution activists have managed to ally themselves with mostly sexually and socially conservative groups in their call for the suppression of sex work . By using slogans like\"end demand\" or \"abolish prostitution now\", they have been calling for the so-called \"Swedish Model\", in which the act of selling sex is formally decriminalised, while clients are charged with a monetary fine . By increasing the cost of a sexual transaction, the law should work as a deterrent . A variation of the law has been implemented in other small countries, such as Norway, Iceland, and, most recently, Northern Ireland . Supporters of this approach claim that only this particular law will reduce human trafficking as well as prostitution . However ,  the Swedish approach comes with many flaws and open questions . Because its goal is a society without sex workers , the law does not intend to provide any guidance on the laws we need in a society with sex workers . Norway is considering repealing the law , as the evaluation of the law has not been able to prove its success . While the EUROSTAT report on human trafficking does not point to a decrease in human trafficking in Sweden , sex workers' working conditions have worsened . In fact ,  the \"Swedish Approach\" criminalises any attempt to create safe working environments for sex workers , as anyone renting indoor space to sex workers can be charged with \"pimping\" . Ironically, this provision has not reduced pimping, but induced many landlords to put sex workers on the streets in order to avoid a fine for \"pimping\", as the so-called \"Operation homeless\" has shown in Norway . Furthermore ,  Sweden does not allow immigration for the purposes of prostitution and has been deporting migrant sex workers , who are still seen a problem of public order and security . It wasn't until 2011 that a Swedish Court ruled that deporting citizens of the European Union selling sex in Sweden was illegal . Last but not least, even Sweden and Norway tax income from sex work, while refusing to recognise it as labour . As empirical studies on the implementation of the \"Swedish approach\" show, its weaknesses in guaranteeing sex workers' human rights, policy-makers also have become sceptical . A Special Committee of French Senate excluded the provision criminalising clients from the proposed new prostitution law in summer 2014 - based on the recommendations of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights . So far, it is unclear whether France will go forward with the law at all . Britain has also excluded the provision criminalising the purchase of sex from its \"Modern Slavery Bill\" , which has itself been criticised by NGOs for not doing justice to victims of human trafficking . Germany is also working to reform its prostitution law . The Global Network of Sex Work Projects advocates \"decriminalisation\" of sex work . So far , only New Zealand has chosen \"decriminalisation\" as sex work policy , but maybe India will be next . India's chair of the National Commission of Women, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, recently stated that the \"Immoral Traffic Prevention Act\" should be revised in order to create\"conditions conductive for sex workers to live with dignity\" . In fact ,  the existing law casts sex workers simultaneously as dangerous to society and as victims to be forcefully protected from their own choices . Either way, they are not recognised as equal citizens, workers, and members of a social and political community with human rights . By decriminalising sex work, India would set an example for other countries, too . As a law practitioner recently pointed out that \"the position of defining prostitution itself as inherently exploitative and a form of violence against women does not allow people in prostitution to access their right to earn a livelihood through sex work.\" It is time for democracies to include sex workers in policy-making processes and take them seriously - not just because democratic values mandate it, but because sex workers are the experts on the matter .",

            "input": "Sia's video: let's be wary of seeing paedophilia everywhere. Australian musician Sia has apologised to anyone \"triggered\" by her video for Elastic Heart, featuring Shia LaBeouf and 12-year-old dance prodigy Maggie Ziegler, dancing together, in flesh-coloured outfits (Ziegler sporting a platinum Sia wig), in a cage . The video has caused uproar in some quarters . Fame-averse Sia(who generally performs with her face hidden) tweeted:\"I anticipated some 'paedophilia!!!' cries for this video . All I can say is Maddie and Shia are two of the only actors I felt could play these two warring 'Sia self states'\" , adding that her intention was to \"create some emotional content, not to upset anybody\" . The video is jarring . Famously troubled LaBeouf and Ziegler dance around, wrestling, attacking, playing . At one point, LaBeouf holds Ziegler aloft ; at another, he tries to stroke her and she kicks and hisses to get away . Elsewhere, Ziegler wraps her tiny limbs around LaBeouf in a feral grip . Watching it, I realised that the intensity(Sia's \"emotional content\") was the reason it was jarring - the mere fact that the video wasn't carefully benign, cheaply titillating or just plain boring, like so much else in the genre . In Elastic Heart, the grown man and the young girl are alive with feelings for each other, running the gamut from amusement and play through to fury to despair . What isn't there is sexuality . In fact ,  it baffles me how anyone could look seriously at Elastic Heart and claim to see any sexual content whatsoever . Can't a grown man and a young girl produce art with edge and beauty of any kind without a squalid sexual subtext instantly being read into it? Sia seemed to apologise for potentially triggering memories of child sex abuse and grooming (as some accused her of doing, on behalf of abuse victims) . Of course we all sympathise with abuse victims . However, one would imagine that such triggers would be everywhere - perhaps mainly focused on the most ordinary and domestic of situations . All of which couldn't be further away from a highly choreographed performance of an arty cage dance . If some abuse survivors were genuinely disturbed by Elastic Heart then fair enough, but what about those who referred to it as an excuse for their own unease? Are these people aware that Ziegler performed solo, dressed identically, dancing similarly, for Sia's Chandelier video . Did this talented young dancer remind them of child sex abuse then? If not, is it because LaBeouf was in Elastic Heart - so presumably a woman performing the same dance with Ziegler would have been perfectly fine . Is this where we are now: society flinching from the sight of a man and a girl performing together in any way that hasn't been entirely emotionally neutered? Ultimately, this discomfort seems wrapped up in our own dirty, addled, increasingly paranoid 21st-century mindset, in which paedophilia, once so grotesquely secretive, is now seen everywhere and in the most kneejerk fashion . No one could complain about increased awareness of abuse , which means that children are finally protected and believed . Such instincts come from a good (better informed) place . However ,  the situation has surely become overcooked when paedophilia becomes one of the first things we presume and in the most ludicrous settings . It becomes so that everything, even art, is expected to distil and accommodate all the retrospective guilt of bygone eras: the fact that so many perpetrators of the past weren't caught, that we were lax, not observant or protective enough . In some ways, it's good not to forget ; in others, perhaps we need to get past it . The latter is true of Elastic Heart - a video found to be offensive because of sanctioned hysteria, rather than anything happening on screen  - all the more disturbing when set against the wider background of any artist being scared into silence or self-censorship . Sia should not have been badgered into an apology . She had nothing to apologise for . Russia has listed transsexual and transgender people as no longer being allowed to qualify for driving licences . They are to be classed as having \"mental disorders\" , which would also include exhibitionism, voyeurism and fetishism of any kind (others include compulsive gambling and stealing) . The official line is that this is because there are too many road accidents in Russia and tightening medical controls has become necessary . However ,  Russian psychiatrists and human rights lawyers have condemned the move , which appears to follow on from the infamous 2013 legislation that made the promotion of \"non-traditional lifestyles\" illegal . Barring a person from driving for no good reason is a serious matter . It takes away not only a civilian right but also a prime symbol of adult autonomy ; never mind the real logistical difficulties that being car-less might present in parts of Russia . It also means that people who might feel that they'd benefit from some degree of psychiatric counselling would feel less inclined to do so if they feared losing their cars . What a farce . There are some of us who would like it proved that a certain Vladimir Putin is mentally fit to ride that horse he is often(and so sexily!) perched upon . There are shots I've seen where he looks quite thrillingly \"barking\", bobbing about on his saddle, with no top on, brandishing a rifle like the big he-man he oh so obviously is . More seriously, this reminds us that it's still important to keep abreast of Russian moves such as these . Big and small, these laws represent blatant targeting of minorities and cynical affronts to international human rights . This latest one is yet another shift towards the blanket criminalisation of anything other than blessed, state-ordained heterosexuality . We must keep watching . I go pretty low with television, lower than is dignified . But even I have never watched The Jump , the Channel 4 reality show where low-rent celebrities compete in a variety of winter sports, with the slowest two each week being made to perform a ski jump to decide who will be eliminated . There are always casualties during training . This time, Ola Jordan, of Strictly Come Dancing, injured her knee so badly that it threatens her dancing career . The Speaker's wife, Sally Bercow, also injured herself - her ribs, not her gob , so she'll be able to carry on just fine . We all accept this kind of caper as \"normal\", but on what premise is such dangerous and sadistic television justified? I thought Splash! was irresponsible(unfit semi-famous people falling off high-diving boards after minimal training) . But ski jumping - are they kidding? A test of mettle, my derriere; this is Lord of the Flies with frostbite . Why don't programme makers go the whole hog and push C-listers into fast-moving traffic and allow viewers to vote on who gets squelched by an articulated lorry the fastest? If people dislike celebrities, then fine, but breaking their bones should be off limits .",

The December issue of the Journal of Family Psychology contains no fewer than five research papers documenting religion's positive impact on family relationships . Reading them reminds me of why I take my Christian faith seriously and the single reason I celebrate Christmas . What's that reason? It's not the wonderful lights, decorations, and music  - all of which surely do help brighten our spirits and the short days of winter . It's not watching kids' faces when they lay eyes on Santa or receive the toys they wanted . It's not even the seeming overall increase in generosity and loving-kindness in the public square at this time of year . All those aspects of Christmas are precious to me . But the reason I celebrate the holiday is this: Jesus's ministry not only changed the world 2,000 years ago, it's transforming lives to this very day . The essential Christian message of a loving, forgiving God is, at this very moment, healing broken people and families all over the world in ways that deserve to be called miraculous . I could detail many true accounts of such glorious makeovers , but I'll settle for telling you just one . It's the story of how I myself wouldn't exist if it weren't for the positive impact of Christianity on my family . It begins with my maternal grandmother, Michaela Batallan (pronounced bah-tah- YAN) , who defined \"liberated woman\" long before the political movement of the Sixties . We grandkids called her \"Titi.\" Titi was born in 1896 into a well-to-do Catholic family in Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, Cuba . When she was a young woman, she and her sisters emigrated to the United States all by themselves . They ended up living in Southern California . High-spirited, Titi liked to party and, one day at a dance, she met a tall, handsome ladies' man named Guadalupe Armendariz . Born in Guadalajara, Mexico, he himself liked to drink and have fun . He didn't go to church . He didn't believe in God . When Titi was 28, she married Guadalupe , who by then owned a shoe repair shop in Saticoy, California . When they had children- starting with Betty (my mom), Carlos, and Yolanda - Titi gave up partying and began attending a Pentecostal church . It infuriated my grandfather , who demanded that she stop indulging in such religious mumbo-jumbo . She didn't obey . When Carlos was seven, he was stricken with polio and eventually couldn't walk . One day, out of desperation, Titi invited the minister and people from her church to come to the house and pray for healing . My grandfather was not happy ; he wanted my grandmother to take Carlos to the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles for treatment . But that day, he witnessed something he couldn't believe nor explain . After the praying was done, Carlos immediately stood straight up and from that day onward was no longer paralyzed . My grandfather, seeing it happen with his own eyes, fell to his knees . He was never the same man again . My grandfather stopped drinking and partying and began attending church . In 1932, the entire family - my grandpa included- were baptized . Not long afterwards, the family moved to Azusa, California , where my grandfather felt called to become a minister . With the help of his young sons - Titi and he ended up having eight children: four boys, four girls - he built a church with his own hands , using materials he collected from around the neighborhood . It's still standing . Years later, Grandpa Lupe's ministry was so successful his sermons were broadcast on the radio . By and by, he accepted an invitation from my paternal grandfather - Dr  Miguel Guillen, after whom I'm named- to join the Latin American Council of Christian Churches (LACCC) , of which Grandpa Guillen was president . Later, Titi stepped up and founded a sister organization - the Pro-Seminario - to raise funds for the LACCC's fledgling seminary . Just two weeks ago, in Galveston, Texas, I had the honor of preaching at the biennial convention of the LACCC . At ninety-one, it's the oldest, independent, Spanish-speaking Pentecostal organization in the country, with hundreds of churches in the United States, Mexico, and Central America . I and the many others who attended the convention also had the joy of celebrating the 60th anniversary of LACCC's seminary , which Grandma Titi helped to build . Clearly, I don't need the Journal of Family Psychology to tell me that religion has a significantly positive impact on family relationships . But in a day and age when religion is being bashed on a regular basis by pop culture , finding validation of my family's life-changing experience in a well-respected scientific publication makes for a--- well, nice Christmas gift . Yes, Jesus - Christianity - is able to dramatically improve lives . And not always just our own . When Grandma Titi had the courage and conviction to stand up to Grandpa Lupe and embrace the faith , she ended up catalyzing a miraculous change not just in her own life, but in the life of her entire family ... of the LACCC's seminary ... of my own life . If Grandma Titi hadn't invited those Elders to lay hands on my uncle Carlos . If Grandpa Lupe hadn't become a minister . If the Armendariz family hadn't joined the LACCC and met the Guillen family . Then my mother Betty wouldn't have met my father Mariano ...and I wouldn't be here to write this column . Ultimately, yes, Jesus is the reason I'm here . It's the reason I celebrate his birthday - the only reason Christmas means anything to me . For me and the two billion others on the planet whose lives have been remade , it's a time when we celebrate the incarnation of love, light, and life - the hope of a better day, a better life, a better world . Merry Christmas!",

How the hell could Sony give in to the demands of terrorists? And make no mistake about it... The hackers who broke into their computer systems are just that: Terrorists . Sony is a commercial enterprise and it has the prerogative to scrap the release of \"The Interview.\" But Sony is also the face of the United States in this heated relationship with North Korea , and the United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists . Neither should Sony . It's a dark day for America when we cave over a simple, silly Seth Rogen comedy . It's embarrassing . It's humiliating .

I can' t help but think of that brilliant scene in Steven Spielberg's much maligned but hilarious World War II comedy \"1941,\" (1979) when Toshiro Mifune, playing a Japanese submarine commander, is under orders to destroy Hollywood from off the coast of Los Angeles . Mifune beams with pride after destroying the Ferris wheel at the Santa Monica pier . He thinks his mission is a success . He thinks he's conquered America -- just as North Korea probably thinks it has conquered us . But in a way it has . Have at it, guys . Sony has just created a ridiculous, yet dangerous, precedent . Watch the first episode of the brilliant British series \"Black Mirror\"(which debuted in 2011 and is currently streaming on Netflix) to see just how this situation played out and will continue to play out within our society . In the episode, a British princess is kidnapped, and the ransom demand calls for the prime minister to go on live television and have sex with a pig . The world stops ; the masses are enthralled ; the news and social media go to town with the juicy fodder . Some cheer the prime minister's humiliation , some are disgusted , some are apathetic . But beneath it all, society is brought to its knees -- and the Twitterverse welcomes it because it is a damn good spectacle . \"Black Mirror\" -- the first episode, especially -- was incredibly prescient . Sony Pictures' \"The Interview\" is just a movie . It may be just a stupid comedy , but it is still a work of expression -- free expression! -- something that separates us from them . George Washington said,\"If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.\" For anyone to silence our creative voice is just wrong . Laughably wrong . That is why Sony should not buckle to the pressure of these vile threats . I understand that people may have been afraid to go to the big chain theaters to see \"The Interview,\" and I respect their desire to protect themselves and their families . Sincere props, though, to the Alamo Drafthouse in Dallas/Fort Worth for announcing they would show the equally controversial film \"Team America: World Police\" (2004) in place of \"The Interview.\" Thursday afternoon, Paramount announced that they would not publicly screen the movie ,. Sony should seriously consider releasing the Seth Rogen-James Franco (and phenomenal Lizzy Caplan) comedy on-demand for a number of reasons :. One : Sony and all involved will get their incredible payday . Has any recent film received more free hype than \"The Interview\"? Two : No theater will be harmed , even though theaters will lose potential revenue from the film . Three: Most importantly , Sony -- and we, the United States -- will not give in to this ludicrous and obnoxious threat from an impotent and juvenile country . This is America . We stand by our freedom . Even if it's a stupid comedy .",

I love America and believe each citizen needs to be involved in charting the future of our nation . Our churches have compartmentalized faith and kept it from influencing our nation for far too long, just as most of America's leaders compartmentalize their faith from their politics . Today, our nation has become a product of this sad reality . We need to return to the conviction that a faith worth believing in is a faith worth dying for . Our faith cannot be checked at the door like a piece of luggage at an airport . The Time is Now . The time is now for our nation to recognize that we cannot fix ourselves . The signs of our brokenness are glistening in our dark world . The blatant destruction of the family, the killing of unborn children, the continuing racial tension, the rebellion against authority, the ongoing reality of poverty, the rising threat of our security, the clear attacks against religious liberty and, of all things, the arrogance to believe the highest court in our land can rule on what the Bible says is genuine marriage testify to just how broken we really are . Where Do We Go From Here? 1 \\. We need to repent . Repentance occurs when we have a change of mind . This change of mind changes our behavior . As a nation, we need to personally and collectively repent of our sins . We need to ask God for His free gift of forgiveness for the sins we have committed, resulting in change from that point forward . 2 \\. We need to return to God . America is a nation that was built on a deep belief in God . A desire for religious liberty was the catalyst for the beginning of our nation . While we have gone through ups and downs in our history , God has been very merciful and gracious toward us . It is time to return to God . It is time to stop making every issue about ourselves, posturing to ensure we get our way . God's way is the only way . There is no other . Anything less than God's way diminishes our happiness, our fulfillment and even our liberty . 3 \\. We need our churches to wake up . Churches all over our nation need to wake up from the slumber we find ourselves in as a whole . We need pastors to return to their spiritual calling, be rekindled by the fire of God and declare the hope we have in the Lord . As a pastor goes, so goes the church . As our churches go, so goes our nation . The evidence is overwhelming of just how broken we are as a nation . This is the greatest hour for our churches to rise up . Never more has America needed our churches to lead the way forward , serving and influencing our communities with compassion and hope . 4 \\. We need a spiritual awakening . In our history, there have been seasons of spiritual awakening that have influenced the spiritual state of our nation dramatically . Lives were changed and subcultures became different . Spiritual awakening is our greatest need in America today . There are many who have probably never even thought about this need . Others may feel we have gone too far . But I want to assure you : God can do more in a moment than we can ever do in a lifetime . Wherever you are in life, would you just stop for one moment and pray something like this:\"God, would you please bring spiritual awakening to America? It is our greatest need.\"? America's greatest need is the next great move of God . This is our hope .",

How can he ignore the overwhelming and ever-increasing evidence? How can he insist that his subordinates continue their buffoonish insistence that Islamist terror has nothing to do with Islam and that they--secularized Christians and non- observant Jews--know Islam's character better than Muslims themselves? It's easy . President Obama and his commissars fit the longstanding pattern of behavior (insistence, denial, castigation) that the hard left has embraced for generations . In the mid-20th century, leftists, bereft of God and desperate for a new faith, insisted for decade after decade that Comrade Stalin was a paragon of political virtues and that the Soviet Union was Utopia . All reports of purges, terror, man-made famines and the Gulag were fabrications of capitalists and their servants . Even after Premier Khrushchev revealed Stalin's crimes to the world, hardcore leftists excused or ignored the truth, insisting still that Red terror wasn't terror and that Communism was a movement (religion?) of peace and progress, that humankind's hope still waited in the east . Only the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet collapse briefly sobered a few on the extreme left--the milieu in which our president spent his youth and pre-presidency adulthood . But leftists need a utopia, a fantasy heaven on earth, to comfort them and to give their lives purpose . Robbed of the Soviet dream, the forlorn left was in need of a new redeemer . Welcome, Comrade Usama! The left--and young Barack Obama -- already saw Islam as an oppressed religion, the noble faith of the wretched of the earth , while casting Christianity and Judaism in the role once occupied by capitalist imperialists: that of oppressors . Bin Laden gave the left a new torch to carry . While it remained necessary to condemn terrorism in public , the left simultaneously justified it in a globalized version of the Marxist construct of a class struggle . Really, didn't American deserve 9/11? Islamism fit the left like a tailored glove . Just as Western Reds didn't need to endure life in the Soviet Union (\"Pass the foie gras, Comrade!\") . , so today's leftwing cadres need not actually live in the Middle East or North Africa . From the comfort of Cambridge or the splendor of California's coast, they can rationalize radical Islam, a creed that would, if imported here, exterminate them as surely as Comrade Stalin would have purged the old American left . The staff of Charlie Hebdo? Stalin would have killed those pranksters, too . The only difference is that \"Uncle Joe\" would have gotten them all . When you take the long view, it's disheartening(to put it mildly) that the Western left simply cannot live without dreaming of an impossible utopia to be imposed by one ideology or another on the rest of us . Radical Islam? It's a \"religion of peace.\" Just as Soviet Communism was an ideology of peace, justice and brotherhood . So President Obama's just playing by the time-honored rules, substituting Muhammad for Josef Stalin or Mao: Never criticize the Party . Ignore the facts . If the facts can't be ignored , deny or twist them . No matter what, stick to the script (let them laugh for now, they'll see soon enough ...). And anyone who strays one inch must be neutralized , whether as a Trotskyist yesteryear or slandered as an Islamophobe today . The left's existential bleakness and its resultant need to embrace horrid schemes for man-made heavens on earth form a peerless argument for humankind's need for religion . In the absence of belief there is only a desert of the soul . And Red terror gives way to Islamist terror . The Communist International cedes pride of place to the global caliphate . Comrade Stalin fades into Comrade Muhammad . Truth is malleable . Facts are nuisances to be exterminated, along with troublesome people . Middle-class notions of freedom must be shouted down . The rule of the intellectuals must be imposed . Never, ever criticize the cause . Deny everything . Never forget that Islam's a religion of peace . The future is ours, Comrades .",

            "input": "State of the Union: Advice for Joni Ernst. Here's a suggestion for Joni Ernst, the new Republican senator from Iowa , who will deliver the GOP response to the State of the Union address Tuesday night . Get a chorus together and open with this old Sammy Cahn-Jule Styne number:\"It seems to me I've heard that song before; it's from an old familiar score, I know it well, that melody.\" Advance leaks of the president's address indicate he will call for higher taxes on the wealthy and successful in order to pay for programs for the poor and middle class . This is boilerplate Democratic wealth redistribution we've heard since New Deal days , which appeals more to emotions than it does to principles with a long history of success . Since the advent of modern \"anti-poverty\" programs 50 years ago, according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation, \"U.S  taxpayers have spent over $22 trillion on anti-poverty programs.\" And yet the poverty rate remains essentially unchanged . One might conclude then that if you've spent 50 years and $22 trillion trying without success to fix something , perhaps you're doing it wrong and should try a different approach . If the goal is more successful people who can take care of themselves , incentives must be put in place to encourage people to make right decisions . First on any anti-poverty help-the-middle-class list must be a stable family life . A two-parent home where adults love and are committed to each other and in which their children feel loved creates a climate in which moral and economic values like hard work, self-control, personal responsibility and accountability flourish . To help achieve this, parents must be educated and they must have jobs . Government can make this easier by reforming the tax code to remove the \"marriage penalty,\" which in too many instances charges higher taxes to married couples than to singles, and increasing the exemption deductible for children, which might make it possible for one parent to stay home with young children; allow college tuition to be deductible to incentivize more people to obtain a college education and ease their debt upon graduation . Better yet, scrap the tax code entirely and replace it with a flat tax or consumption tax that allows people to save, invest and spend more of the money they earn . Economically, there must be a change in attitude from working to pay bills, to working to build wealth . Bills, like the poor, we will always have with us, but in building wealth one moves toward independence and personal satisfaction that pays dividends in liberty and personal choice . Government should also make it easier for people to move in pursuit of new opportunities . My late grandfather worked for the B and O Railroad for 50 years . He retired with a pension, a gold-plated watch and a lifetime train pass . Those days are long gone . People need to be ready to move to places in pursuit of opportunities that can bring economic and career growth . Earning more produces more in taxable income and more income means more tax money for federal and state treasuries . My wife and I have moved eight times (so far) and each move provided new opportunities, more experience and eventually higher incomes . Here's another suggestion for Sen  Ernst and the new Republican Congress . Let the Democrats focus on misery, poverty and failure . You promote hope, opportunity and achievement . Begin featuring people with stories to tell of how they overcame difficult circumstances -- from poverty, welfare, addiction, single motherhood, and so on -- and are now independent, strong and if not prosperous, then at least free of their addiction to government . Leaders should inspire others to follow examples of people who have succeeded in life . Instead ,  the Democrats' mantra has been that the poor and middle class can't succeed without government help . If that were true , the money spent on programs aimed at the poor and middle class would have succeeded by now . It's long past time for a new direction and for a new \"song\" with different words . In the month we observe the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr , how about \"We HAVE overcome\"?",

Last Tuesday, a ninth-grader at John F  Kennedy High School in Paterson, N.J , was caught on video throwing his 62-year-old teacher to the ground and wrestling with him in order to retrieve his cellphone , which the teacher had confiscated . Teachers at the school allow cellphones to be used for educational purposes in the classroom , but they may take them and hold them until the end of class if a student appears to be using his phone for any other purpose . Granted , the boy may have demonstrated problems controlling his impulses in other settings, too , but the video of his attack has resulted in national attention . And that's because it isn't the first dramatic example of how attached to our phones we have become . Last year, a Houston woman was shot by a mugger when she refused to hand over her cellphone . She survived , and she later asserted that she had done the right thing . In 2013, a 22-year-old man was killed by a train when he tried to retrieve the cellphone he had dropped on the tracks . Without giving a great deal of thought to the psychological implications, our species has deployed mobile technology very quickly, in a very widespread manner . One reason is that the marketplace embraced smartphones in an astounding way  -- as if our phones and their apps are a lock-and-key fit with our psyches . According to one source, there are 7 billion mobile devices on earth, one for almost each person . What is \"in\" our cellphones that would lead people to attack others or risk death to keep them? I would argue that the phones absorb and record our thoughts and intentions so dramatically that we become unconsciously convinced they are \"parts of us.\" Why else would so many people hesitate even to leave a room without taking their cellphones with them? Why would they interrupt meetings and family time to check them? Why would young people be opting to spend their money on newer, faster ones, instead of on clothing? Why would there be so much interest in personalizing the sounds they make, the apps they hold and the cases that hold them? I contend we have already crossed the Rubicon, almost irrevocably incorporating technology into our psyches in a way that makes us part flesh and blood, part hardware . The fact that the hardware is outside our bodies(for now) does not mean the integration has not occurred . We are psychologically magnetized to our devices . That's why some people will fight for them, and even die for them . The selfie has become so ubiquitous that it no longer seems bizarre to see someone smiling into a cellphone or sticking out her tongue or making a sad face -- acting-- and then snapping a photo . And these images are then sent not only to her supposed \"friends,\" who may number in the hundreds, but also to her unconscious mind -- reinforcing the idea that she is what her cellphone records her to be . Take away the cellphone and, in some measure, she believes she disappears . She feels she dies a little bit, or more than a little bit, psychologically . The business of selling \"selfie sticks\"-- telescoping rods that hold a cellphone far enough away to facilitate a really good shot-- is robust enough to make many retailers place large kiosks of them near the checkout register . Cellphones, you might say, are growing arms . Ours apparently aren't long enough . This is just the beginning . Cellphones will soon be able to determine whether you are looking at the content on their screens, rather than looking away . They will demand attention . The extent to which we own them versus them owning us will be increasingly in doubt . Make no mistake : While technology can be good when harnessed for the good (raising money for charity occurs to me) , there will be hell to pay for giving so little thought to the downside . That downside likely includes an epidemic of narcissism in young people, increased rates of anxiety and dramatically decreased feelings of autonomy . Because to the extent that one's self-image is outsourced to a mobile device, it is no more deeply rooted than that . Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum bring you the news that matters to you!",

Australia is known as the \"lucky country.\" It was a phrase first coined in 1964 by social critic Donald Horne, and has come to represent the visceral feelings of both Australians, and visitors to the nation . It is seen as a reflection of a high standard of living, and a geographical insulation from the bad actors of the world theater . But ten days out from Christmas, Australia has lost its innocence . On a day of brilliant blue skies, the terrorism of the post-9/11 world finally arrived on Australian soil , taking hold of city streets . A man wielding a gun and an Islamic flag took customers and staff hostage at a cafe in central Sydney . As a native of Sydney, home for the holidays, safe and sound but shaken and furious, December 15 is a day that will forever be seared into my mind . I've been to the Lindt Cafe ; in fact ,  I once worked across the street from it . Emotions have run high here all day -- from fear to anger to a desire for vengeance . I never expected this in Sydney . The profoundly shocking standoff with all its disruptions to city life has struck fear in Sydneysiders, unaccustomed to these types of events . The mood in Sydney is one of fear and uncertainty . Until now, Australian authorities have been flawless in preventing terror attacks on Australian soil . They have been aggressive in their pursuit of intelligence and would-be terrorists , foiling plot after plot . September saw the biggest anti-terrorism operation in Australia's history , involving up to 800 police in coordinated raids , sparked by intelligence reports that Islamic State supporters were planning to seize a random member of the public and behead them live on camera . Yet , it was inevitable that one would finally slip through the cracks , and Monday Sydney joined the ranks of cities such as New York, London and Madrid as the latest victim of what appears to be Islamic terrorism . Monday's distressing events have renewed Australians' concerns about Islamist objectives, and a growing Islamic presence in the country . Some Australians recognize that this likely terrorist attack is a result of the poor immigration decisions of Australian governments, both conservative and liberal, over the last four decades . A lack of liberty, an abandonment of reason, the imposition of Sharia on Muslims and non-Muslims, as well as the treatment of women are just some of the serious moral problems within the Muslim world . Islamist views are incompatible with the liberty enjoyed by Australians and Americans . Interestingly, Monday's events have also prompted Australians to revisit their gun laws . With Islamic supremacism a mainstream interpretation of Islam, deeply rooted in Islamic scripture and endorsed by many of Islam's most influential scholars, Australians are beginning to understand the nature of the Islamic threat , and studying their own weaknesses in its wake . The United Kingdom has had two beheadings of members of the public in the last two years, with neither police nor civilians able to prevent it . It also has prohibitive gun laws . Australians are looking to America, and not the UK for guidance . With this sort of threat, the normal calculus of a civilized society with a small, armed (or unarmed) police force upon which the citizens are forced to rely, no longer adds up . It is unsurprising that home-grown terrorism is most rampant in nations with strict gun control . It is a reality that Australia's powerful anti-gun lobby seems to wish to ignore . It is times like these that Americans should be thankful for their Second Amendment, and crush any effort or force seeking to weaken or remove it . Right now, they are the envy of a growing number of Australians that wish they were armed . Australia will never be the same again . Sydney just lost a little of its shine .",

I was just one Australian face in a human sea of more than one and half million Parisians yesterday . I was trying to comprehend what I was a part of when the placard thrust in front of my eyes made it clear : \"La liberte d'expression n'a pas de religion\"- freedom of expression has no religion . This was a rally to defend the essential global human right to free expression . A right that should not be bound by religious, cultural or political strictures . We were marching to remember the victims of the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre and the Kosher grocery store siege . We were marching in sympathy with those in mourning who joined us . We were marching in defiance, determined to rise above the fear and chaos the terrorists inflicted on our city . But ,  overwhelmingly, we marched to defend our right to freely express our views . The main march stretched three kilometres between Place de la Republique and Place de la Nation, tracking down Boulevard Voltaire . When I cried \"Je suis Charlie, nous somme Charlie!\", it was in the spirit of the French philosopher Voltaire's revolutionary words:\"I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.\" The props of the rally - giant pencils supporting the French flag, a flood of demonstrators holding pens aloft and bibs emblazoned with the faces of the massacred Charlie Hebdo staff - told the story . Paris has been my home for a year . I am a research fellow with the World Editors Forum and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers which is based in the city . It's a long way from the University of Wollongong in Australia , where I am on staff as a journalism academic . But the principle of freedom of expression we were marching to defend binds journalists, writers and artists, and by extension all citizens, globally . It transcends national borders, distance, culture, language, class and religion . That's why, as we marched, we saw Paris residents hanging models of pencils and banners carrying free speech slogans from their balconies . And it's why we paused to listen while a little African girl bellowed \"Je suis Charlie!\" from a third story window at her mother's side . We were a calm sea of over 1.5 million people pouring through the grand boulevards of central Paris . Led by the families of those killed and over 40 world leaders who walked with linked arms, it was a significant moment in history, a moment triggered by outrage at the act of terrorists who massacred journalists and cartoonists in the middle of a weekly editorial meeting and ordinary citizens doing their shopping . It was also a moment fuelled by a collective determination to display unity and defiance in the face of terror and fear . The attack on Charlie Hebdo and the climate of fear and anxiety it created are, sadly, regular occurrences in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Mexico, where journalists are frequent targets . The western media too often turns a blind eye to the murder of journalists elsewhere . The Paris unity march represents a watershed moment in the struggle to protect journalists and defend freedom of expression globally . Kalashnikov-wielding terrorists took the fight into the heart of a newsroom in one of western Europe's biggest cities . If that doesn't wake up complacent democracies to the need to vigorously defend the right to report , nothing will . Once the news cycle moves on from Paris and the cries of \"Je suis Charlie\" fade, we must harness the levels of public support and political will to enact significant and lasting change globally . We must be on guard against the already audible attempts to justify a further curtailment of media and internet freedoms in the interests of national security in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks . The threats posed to investigative journalism by mass surveillance, data retention and the criminalisation of reporting certain information under anti-terrorism legislation are already significant . Especially in Australia . It would be an enormous tragedy if the lasting legacy of the Charlie Hebdo massacre was ultimately a further undermining of privacy and freedom of expression rights . Let us honour the victims and survivors of the Paris terrorist attacks by finding a sustainable balance between the need for anti- terrorism measures against our collective human right to freely express our views . As the murdered editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane Charbonnier, told Le Monde in 2011:\"I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.\"",

The Senate Intelligence Committee's scathing torture report not only described the brutality of the CIA's interrogation methods, but also demonstrated their ineffectiveness . Led by ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, former Bush administration officials have rushed to the airwaves to defend the CIA . \"I would do it again in a minute,\" Cheney said on NBC's Meet the Press , claiming that Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs) produced \"actionable intelligence that kept us safe from attacks\" . Cheney & Co may not win the debate , but they have succeeded in muddying the waters . That is unfortunate because, beneath their bombastic caricatures of the torture programme, there's more agreement than first appears among people who actually count . Aside from former officials trying to save their reputations, it isn't one camp saying torture didn't \"work\" and one saying it did . Rather , it's one camp saying it didn't, and the other saying \"we have no idea but did it anyway\" . On several key points, the CIA is closer in substance to the Senate report than to its loudest defenders . 'Unprepared' for torture . The Senate report found that the CIA was \"unprepared\" to operate a detention and interrogation system . The Agency's written response to the report says;\"We fully agree\" - the CIA had \"no cadre of trained and experienced interrogators, little experience handling and moving prisoners, and no core competency in prison management . [...] The Agency had too few analysts and linguists with the expertise required to support[a detention] programme\" . In other words ,  there is no dispute that the programme was started and run on the fly . A critical finding of the Senate report was that torturing detainees did not yield otherwise unobtainable actionable intelligence . CIA director, John O Brennan, admitted that the agency \"has not concluded that it was the use of EITs that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees\" . So while the CIA still maintains that it gained valuable intelligence from detainees , it is not saying the abusive methods produced it . The Senate report also describes how the CIA sought out two psychiatrists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, to construct the torture programme instead of actual experienced interrogators, on the assumption that long-established humane and lawful interrogation methods wouldn't work . In its response, the CIA acknowledged that it had to look beyond the agency to find experts on \"non-standard means of interrogation\" since it was not an area of expertise that CIA officers or the US government possessed . The CIA called Mitchell and Jessen's background \"so unique\" that the agency \"would have been derelict had[it] not sought them out when it became clear that CIA would be heading into the uncharted territory of the programme\" . In other words ,  the torture programme was so out of whack with what professional interrogators do that the CIA had to go outside the US government to find people to do it . There still are important areas of disagreement between the Senate report and the CIA . The CIA is too protective of its own to acknowledge the full import of its descent into torture or to disavow the programme entirely . But the agency - unlike its loudest defenders - is not endorsing torture as a means of gaining intelligence or keeping the country safe . To be sure , basing the case against torture on its total ineffectiveness is a risky proposition . Torture produces a lot of information and while victims frequently make things up to ease their suffering , they may also on occasion say things of some value . That's why it is important to remember that torture is illegal under any circumstances regardless of its utility . But in a democracy, the strength of legal norms depends partly on their acceptance by the public . So while the public shouldn't have to be persuaded that barbaric methods fail to make them safer , doing so reinforces their illegality . The flurry of media appearances by Cheney and other torture defenders has created a false sense that there is a genuine divide over whether torture\"works\" . But neither the CIA nor professional interrogators actually say that . So while we can continue to debate other aspects of the CIA programme , including whether those responsible should be sanctioned , let's stop pretending that there are two legitimate sides to this particular story .",

In his usual prescient fashion, Guy Debord once lamented that \"young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit . Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit.\" The Situationists' vision of the future was not, as I'm sure you've guessed, an optimistic one , but it's nice to see that their spirit is alive and well on the London underground . \"How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labour when one secretly feels that one's job should not exist?\" a poster asks , as part of a campaign called #bullshitjobs devised by the anarchist magazine Strike! Another poster reads:\"The moral and spiritual damage that comes from the situation is profound . It is a scar on our collective soul . Virtually no one talks about it.\" And a third:\"It's as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs for the sake of keeping us all working.\" Just what every commuter needs on their first day back at work, you might think . But I love these subvertisements, mainly because they are right . No one talks about the soul-crushing sadness experienced by the chronically exhausted and unfulfilled hordes . Forget the garbage disposal : we're in urgent need of an army of pooper-scooper-wielding refuseniks , because bullshit jobs are everywhere . Of course , complaining about any of this or doing something as daring as opting out finds you guilty of the most conspicuous of crimes against capitalism: laziness . Or a suspicious lack of ambition, resulting in the label of \"scrounger\" if you're working class and that of \"pampered entitled millennial with no moral backbone\" if you're middle class . But don't despair : humans have an incredible capacity for survival . There are ways to endure the pointlessly mundane jobs that many of us do . Here are my tips :. One of the most level-headed people I know sets very little store in his job when it comes to defining himself as a human being . Instead ,  it's the things he does outside of work that he regards as his main means of personal fulfilment . Guy Debord regarded maximum pleasure as the central aim of any revolution , so start your own personal one, via music or reading or sex or anything that you enjoy doing creatively . Then pour your soul into these activities instead of thinking about work . If you can do one of these activities during working hours , even better . Not people who use the word \"facetime\" as a way of describing hanging out, or talk about things \"going forward\" . These people will be first up against the wall . I mean family and friends, people you love . Love is the answer (actually, anaesthetising yourself with drink and drugs is the answer , but unfortunately it's less slimming) . This sounds flippant but can actually be an effective means of delaying job- induced madness . A friend who worked stacking shelves in Tesco overnight was able to keep his sanity by pretending he was playing a game of foodstuff-sized Tetris . In a similar vein, you could see how many Cradle of Filth lyrics you can subtly weave into your customer service emails, wreak subtle psychological havoc upon your colleagues, or, if you're a hairdresser , deliberately give everyone terrible haircuts for your own amusement (my hairdresser has been doing this for years) . The biggest modern lie is the one told by the Steve Jobses of this world : that, career-wise, we must do what we love in order to experience true happiness . It's a lovely thought but, unfortunately for the generation sold this nonsense by idealistic baby-boomers, a fulfilling job is a luxury, not a given . Instead , as some means of twisted compensation, we're offered slave wages, zero-hours contracts and made-up job titles . But as depressing as things look, it's important to keep hold of those youthful aspirations and harness them , if not for financial profit, then for sanity's sake . It's exhausting , I know, especially as in Britain we work the longest hours in Europe . You are right to be furious . We all are . In the words of the retro anarchist-punk soundbite dusted off by Russell Brand:\"Let's have a revolution, yeah?\" (At least after a short nap .) Let's continue to campaign for better and more flexible working hours, wages that people can actually survive on, and freedom from harassment and exploitation . Let's vote . Let's join our unions . Let's take the bastards to tribunal (whoops, no legal aid) . Because if you're going to do a bullshit job , you might as well get what you can out of it .",

            "input": "Torture is a crime, time to end the impunity. This week the world has seen headline after headline about the CIA's horrifying practise of systematic torture and cruelty : Mentions of \"rectal hydration\" and rape threats, sleep and sensory deprivation, forced nudity, stress positions, subjection to cold temperatures, food deprivation, hanging from bars, confinement in a \"coffin size\" box, hooding, and physical assaults ; a man left shackled and naked to die overnight in a secret CIA facility in Afghanistan ; psychologists contracted to design the best ways to break the human spirit ; doctors ensuring that victims were fit to endure more torture . These were violations of the most fundamental human rights and crimes under international law . But still, no promises to bring any of those responsible to justice . It has been known for years that the US turned to torture as part of its response to the crime against humanity that was committed on September 11, 2001 . Today, the cruelty carried out in the CIA secret detention programme run under authority granted by President George W Bush still has the power to shock and sicken . While the CIA may have exceeded its authority and lied to him , he still had a part to play . But we must not forget that behind the text of the summary report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the details contained within, are cases of real people . People whose lives have been broken , whose humanity was forgotten under this state-sanctioned programme . The case of Abu Zubaydah has long been known . Amnesty International first raised its concerns with the US government in April 2002 . He was the first person to be taken into CIA custody considered by the agency to have high intelligence value . Abu Zubaydah was effectively treated as a human guinea pig to test the CIA's emerging interrogation regime . He was subjected to a range of torture methods, including being waterboarded multiple times . The SSCI summary adds some new chilling details . A July 15, 2002 cable sent by the interrogation team at \"Detention Site Green\", believed to be in Thailand, ended:\"In light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented, we need to get reasonable assurances that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life.\" CIA officers responded that \"all major players are in concurrence that [Abu Zubaydah] should remain incommunicado for the rest of his life\" . Then , after Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 47 days of complete isolation, he was subjected to numerous \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" including physical assaults, stress positions, cramped confinement, white noise, and sleep deprivation \"in varying combinations, 24 hours a day for 17 straight days\" . Reports were constantly fed back to top authorities . Daily cables sent from \"Detention Site Green\" to CIA headquarters recorded that Abu Zubaydah frequently \"cried\", \"begged\", \"pleaded\", and \"whimpered\" . At times, he was \"hysterical\" and \"distressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate\" . Waterboarding sessions would result in \"hysterical pleas\" , and on at least one occasion, Abu Zubaydah \"became completely unresponsive\" until he received medical attention . Abu Zubaydah's ordeal is not yet over . After four and a half years in secret CIA custody he was transferred to Guantanamo , where he remains today . He has never been charged with any crime . The injustice continues . On August 5, 2002, at the same time that Abu Zubaydah was being tortured in Thailand, CIA headquarters approved an interrogation plan for Ridha al-Najjar at another secret facility, dubbed\"Detention Site Cobalt\" , believed to be the Salt Pit facility in Afghanistan . The interrogation plan for Najjar included isolation in total darkness, lowering the quality of his food, keeping him in cold temperatures, 24-hour-a-day loud music, shackling and hooding . Over one two-day period, he was left with his wrists handcuffed to an overhead bar for 22 hours a day in order to \"break his resistance\" . On September 21, 2002, his interrogators sent a cable describing Najjar as \"clearly a broken man\" and \"on the verge of complete breakdown\" . His detention and interrogation \"became the model\" for the treatment of detainees at that facility, according to the SSCI . Twelve years later, Najjar remains in US custody in Bagram, Afghanistan . He has never been charged or tried, and is still being denied his right to challenge his detention in court . A petition on his behalf is currently pending before the US Supreme Court . The psychological impact of such intense cruelty has devastated those subjected to it . According to the SSCI, many detainees\"exhibited psychological and behavioural issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation\" . Majid Khan, who was held in secret CIA custody for three and a half years before being transferred in 2006 to Guantanamo, where he remains today, is said to have engaged in numerous acts of self-harm, including\"attempting to cut his wrist on two occasions, to chew into his arm at the inner elbow, cut a vein in the top of his foot and into his skin at the elbow joint using a filed toothbrush\" . As the world struggles to comprehend the details in the summary it is important to remember all we've been given is a snapshot, a peek through the keyhole to the dark secrets hidden within . The report released yesterday is just a summary of a full report that runs to 6,700 pages . That report describes the detention and interrogation of 119 detainees held by the CIA . Senator Dianne Feinstein said that \"decisions will be made at a later date\" as to whether the whole report will be declassified and released . Amnesty International believes this should be done sooner rather than later, indeed should be set in motion now . The Senate committee also needs to address the fact that the US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture . The CIA detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance  - which, like torture, is a crime under international law . No one has been brought to justice for these crimes . This accountability gap leaves the US squarely on the wrong side of its international obligations . Those responsible, no matter their current or previous level of office, must be brought to justice, along with those in other countries that colluded with the CIA to facilitate these programmes . December 10 marked 30 years since the adoption of the Convention Against Torture - an anniversary which the US would do well not to gloss over . The US ratified the treaty in 1994 . President Obama should make a public commitment to end the impunity being enjoyed by those who authorised and carried out the crimes committed in the CIA programmes of rendition, interrogation and detention . And victims should be offered redress  - most urgently they must be offered treatment to help them overcome the trauma to which they were unlawfully exposed . If they have committed crimes they should be prosecuted and punished for them , but as victims, they too deserve justice . Laying out a catalogue of abuses is not enough . There must be accountability too .",

            "input": "Torturing Muslims is an 'awesome' way to get things done. On December 9, the Senate Select Committee released a partial report of the horrifying, illegal torture tactics used by the CIA during the Bush administration . Some question the timing . I think the timing is perfect . We are now in a position to recall what past black activists, from Martin Luther King to Angela Davis to Muhammad Ali, knew when they spoke against the immoral actions of their nation in Vietnam . The protesters in Ferguson got a sneak peek, or a reminder, of this lesson in August, when Palestinians, who had experience with being shot at with US-made weaponry, advised US protesters on how to treat the searing pain of tear gas bombs (pour Coca-Cola directly over the eyes) . But recently, because of the quick succession of the failures to indict the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and then the release of the torture report, we are at a moment in which the link between our domestic terrorism and our international terrorism is being drawn for the rest of us . Immediately after the release of the report, many in the media did their best to claim that the release of this report was part of some wider conspiracy to demoralise Americans . The best example of this would be Fox News' Andrea Tantaros , who, in the middle of a conversation about the report, began shouting that \"The United States of America is awesome, we are awesome.\" She seemed positively indignant that the Obama administration was attempting to \"have this discussion to show us how we're not awesome\" . For those unfamiliar with the slang of US hipsters and teenagers, we generally use the \"awesome/not awesome\" binary to evaluate things like pizza, beer, or surfboards - not the moral character of a nation-state . But , if we are to adopt her method of expression , Tantaros seems to be forgetting that she is able to be on television in part because one or two generations ago, a few people declared that women not being able to participate in news media was not very \"awesome\" . She also forgets that a couple generations before that, her Greek last name would have prevented her from being considered\"white\" , and she thus would not have been allowed in front of a camera . Whether Tantaros accepts it or not, the history of equality in the US has been one of people deciding that things were not yet awesome, and taking it upon themselves to make them more awesome . But we should note that Tantaros was primarily angry at being forced to have a public conversation, and at being embarrassed that the world was seeing us have a discussion about our behaviour . \"This makes us look bad,\" she pleaded . \"And all this does is have our enemies laughing at us.\" Not only is torture illegal , but by US' own standards, it is ineffective . The CIA knew this . The 1992 US Army Field Manual on Interrogation explicitly advises that \"the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results\", and can \"induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear\" . This ended up being true - we now know that one prisoner told the CIA that he was trying to recruit black Muslims in the US to attack gas stations . He later admitted that he made up the story,\"because he thought that's what interrogators wanted to hear\" . This year has also shown us that ineptitude can also happen at home, with our domestic police forces . The Ferguson Police Department has utterly failed to de-escalate tensions at every possible opportunity . We now know the officer that killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice was not fit to hold a pistol, much less a badge . In fact ,  a report by the Justice Department has shown that Cleveland police officers routinely use unjustified force in arrests, and fire their weapons \"carelessly\" , putting both innocent bystanders and themselves in danger . If the timing of the one-two punch of public revelations of anti-black racism and criminal torture do not convince us , then we can at least recognise a pattern in the people that are desperate to deny both . The torture report is available to anyone to view online, provided they are willing to wade through pages and pages of gruesome accounts . There is an account of putting a prisoner in a diaper, shackling him to the ceiling, and leaving him for days . One prisoner died of hypothermia after being chained, nearly naked, to a concrete floor . Many were sexually assaulted . Despite this, Republican Congressman Peter King attempted to wave these facts away, declaring that no harmful torture occurred . Instead ,  he brushed it off as merely a few\"people made to stand in awkward positions\" . This is the same Peter King who said that Eric Garner did not die because of a chokehold, but because he was overweight . It is also the same Peter King that implied that Garner, in his final moments, was lying about not being able to breathe . If Tantaros' reaction to the defiling of the \"awesomeness\" of the US seems childish , Peter King's reaction is worse . It is the rhetorical equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears, and shouting \"nyah, nyah, I can't hear you\" - as your brother drowns beside you . And , as if we needed any clearer indication on how racism and callousness regarding the torture of non-whites were connected , we were given a clear reminder last week , when Facebook released a 23 second commercial about a feature of its service, and cast a Sikh man as the spokesperson . The video was immediately bombarded with angry comments calling the man an \"ISIL terrorist\", a \"raghead\", and a \"sand nigger\" . One commenter blasted Facebook itself, asking\"Why do you have a Muslim on this pic?\" When another user replied that he was a Sikh, the commenter responded:\"Same thing.\" We might chalk this up to ignorance : Our education system is focused on white European and US history . Most Americans don't know the difference between a friendly Sikh man and a scary Muslim terrorist . Actually, most Americans couldn't tell you the difference between a fatwah and a plate of chapati . But we should be more precise here - it's not that we don't know , it's that we don't want to know . But then again , separating \"good\" brown people from \"bad\" ones isn't the point, and wouldn't make a difference . For too many of us, anyone brown and bearded is automatically al-Qaeda, and deserves to be tortured and killed . Our understanding of humanity does not apply to anyone that can be mistaken for Muslim or Arab , and we excuse ourselves for this moral exception by constantly reminding ourselves that our country was attacked in 2001 . It's not that we can't know that we are terrorising black people . It's not that we can't know that the people we tortured in those prisons were people . We could, if we wanted to . But we don't want to . The events of the past few months have shown us that we are not up against a few crooked cops, a group of rogue rednecks, or a wacky news station . We are up against an empire of immorality that, in its fear, would rather shoot and waterboard the world, than to learn about it . If there is a true \"enemy\" , it is that Empire . It has been hiding in plain sight , and this year, it has revealed itself- in the mirror . As Tantaros says, it laughs at us . What we choose to do about that is up to us .",

            "input": "The trap of insecurity: Extrajudicial killings in Kenya. Over the years, Kenyan police have acquired a dubious reputation of being a source of insecurity instead of one of security . In many instances, the police represent clear, palpable and imminent danger to the lives of Kenyan citizens . The transformation of the police from a security institution into a bastion of insecurity didn't occur overnight , nor did it come as a surprise ; it was the inevitable outcome of a number of factors . Some of these factors are beyond their control . For instance ,  policemen are underpaid and ill-equipped to do their job ; others seem to be an institutional choice, such as the endemic corruption within the police force . Under the previous constitution, the police were at the beck and call of the executive , which used it as a tool of coercion to further its political goals . As a result , when confronted by a new security situation, the executive's default response has been to set up a \"special\" police unit to address the situation . In most cases, t he unit would operate under minimum oversight and maximum impunity . More than any other institution in the country, the police has deep institutional problems , but one of the most detrimental ones is its involvement in extrajudicial killings. Remarkably, this is not only a new phenomenon , but it is deeply entrenched with a clear pattern . In the 1990s, crime was on the rise in Kenya . In order to stem the high rates of carjacking and violent robberies, in 1995 the government formed a new police unit called the Flying Squad. This special unit was given the express authority to shoot any suspect on sight without due process . As a result, the unit was implicated in multiple and egregious extrajudicial killings , which they claimed was their way of dealing with the new security reality . In some cases, the police officers were caught shooting suspects after they had surrendered or were lying face down . The unit executed several innocent people in cold blood . The police command instead of seeing the unit's trigger-happy attitude as dangerous, celebrated it as the only \"medicine\" with which to treat spiralling crime . The late 1980s and 1990s saw deep economic problems, shrinking political space for dissent and increasing insecurity . This was the time when criminal gangs emerged and flourished . These gangs e stablished their \"spheres of influence\" , mostly in slum areas, where the state's presence was negligible . To establish loyalty from the community and enhance their legitimacy, these groups provided security for a token fee . To exert their superiority, from time to time, these groups engaged each other over \"territories\" and business interests . Among these groups were the Mungiki, the Taliban, the Kosovo boys, the Baghdad boys, Chinkororo, and the Kalenjin Warriors . Mungiki is a Kikuyu word for multitude . The organisation had both a cultural and political element to it . In the beginning of the group's existence, the social aspect was more prominent and it involved traditional Kikuyu beliefs in the god named Ngai. But as the organisation expanded, it began taking an overtly political posture , which brought them into confrontation with the state . Mungiki operated primarily in the Nairobi slums, in the Central Province and parts of the Rift Valley . In these areas, the group started providing the poor in slum areas with protection and social services for a fee . Refusal to pay the protection \" tax \" almost always resulted in violence and killings . In 2002, the Kenyan government banned 18 of these criminal gangs . The spread of Mungiki's influence forced the government in 2007 to establish a special police unit called Kwekwe which was tasked primarily with hunting down members of Mungiki . But Kwekwe's operation against the criminal group went too far . According to a National Commission on Human Rights 2008 report:\"Extrajudicial executions and other brutal acts of extreme cruelty have been perpetrated by the police against so-called Mungiki adherents and that these acts may have been committed pursuant to official policy sanctioned by the political leadership, the police commissioner and top police commander\" . HRW observed in 2008 that,\"The brutality of the police crackdown matched or even exceeded that of the Mungiki itself.\" Kenya has been in the crosshairs of the transnational jihadi movement . In the past, the fact that Kenya was seen as being firmly in the western sphere of influence made Kenya a target , with most of the incidents, including the 1998 US embassy attack, targeting western interests . However ,  after Kenya's intervention in Somalia in 2011, the country itself become a target . Terrorism activity in Kenya reached a peak with the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in September 2013 , when unidentified gunmen killed 67 people and injured almost 200 others . As a response to the growing terrorism threat, the Kenyan government created the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) in March 2003, following the 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned Mombasa hotel . This was also accompanied by the passage of Anti-Terrorism Act in 2012 . As part of the wider counterterrorism effort, the government also began a huge crackdo wn on the Somali and Muslim communities especially in Nairobi, parts of Northern Kenya and coastal Kenya . As the crackdown intensified, a number of extrajudicial killings of Muslim preachers took place, some in the coastal city of Mombasa . Most of the victims were suspected of having connections with Somalia's al-Shabab group . While in almost all the cases the police deny culpability , research by human rights organisations reveals the ATPU's involvement . In its August 2014 report,\"Kenya: Killings, disappearance by anti-terror police,\" HRW points to\" ...evidence of at least 10 cases of extrajudicial killings of terrorism suspects, some of whom were last seen in ATPU custody or had been threatened by the unit's officers after courts had released them\" . The Kenyan government has accused some of the clerics who were killed of recruiting Muslim youth for terrorism activities through their mosques . However ,  despite initiating investigations against them, the government never followed through to prosecute the imams . After public outcry over the killing of Muslim cleric Ibrahim \"Rogo\" Omar, the government set up a task force to investigate his murder . The director of public prosecution promised in 2013 that he will institute an inquest, but has not done so yet . One of the commissions established following the 2007-2008 violence to look at the role of the police, was the Waki Commission . Established to look into the circumstances and facts surrounding the violence and provide recommendations, the Waki Commission found that of the 1,500 deaths, the police was responsible for more than 30 percent of them . As a result several reform measures were proposed including the establishment of a civilian oversight of the police, and many other reforms . However ,  due to lack of political will, the police reforms have stalled . The extrajudicial killings by the police in Kenya are anchored in a systemic lack of accountability and deeply entrenched culture of pervasive impunity . While the police undoubtedly face ever changing security challenges , its involvement in extrajudicial killings make matters worse . Effective security sector reform is the only way forward .",

            "input": "Treating Africans with an untested Ebola drug. It was reported in The Guardian last week that Emergency, an Italian NGO, administered an untested heart drug known as Amiodarone, to patients at an Ebola treatment centre in Lakka, Sierra Leone . The British medics sent to work at the centre raised alarm as early as November about Emergency's approaches to palliative care . Amiodarone, a drug licenced to regulate the heartbeat, has never been tested outside of a lab setting to treat humans or animals infected with Ebola . It was neither approved by the Sierra Leonean health ministry nor listed among the 53 drugs that have an antiviral effect on Ebola . In a report to UK Med, the British healthcare professionals argued that \"the toxic side effects of Amiodarone could in fact be contributing to increased morbidity within the ETC [ebola treatment centre]\" . While the mortality rate at Emergency's centre is disputed - ranging from 58 and 67 percent - the death rate at centres run by Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), for instance, ranges from 50 and 60 percent . Most alarming is the concern that foreign-run Ebola treatment centres could be using unorthodox testing methods with impunity . Emergency's use of Amiodarone without a proper clinical trial or patient consent prompted censure from a senior scientist about the recklessness of this approach and a walk-out over safety fears by the UK health workers sent to work at the treatment centre . Apparently, the NGO stopped using the drug after receiving a request from the Department of International Development (DFID) , which had been alerted by the British medics . When rumours circulated early-on during the Ebola outbreak, that the virus was a form of bio warfare , critics were quick to label these ideas \"conspiracy theories\" . Yet ,  fears about western medicine being used to harm are neither irrational nor far-fetched . As unconscionable as Emergency's practices appear , there is a long history of unethical drug testing on poor and vulnerable communities across the globe . Perhaps one of the most famous cases of unethical experimental treatment was in 1932 when Public Health Service in the United States began the \"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\" at a time when there was no known cure for syphilis . The study initially included 600 black men - 399 with and 201 without syphilis  - most of whom were poor and illiterate sharecroppers enticed with incentives such as free medical exams, meals on examination days, and promises that their relatives would receive burial stipends in the event of their deaths . The men were deceived into thinking that they were being treated for \"bad blood\" . They neither received proper treatment nor were they informed of the true nature of the study . Instead of lasting for six months, as originally projected, the study went on for 40 years . When penicillin was developed to treat syphilis in 1947 , treatment was withheld from all 600 subjects . In 1973, a class action suit was filed on behalf of the men in the study and settled out of court for $9 million . Similar experiments were held in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948 , when Public Health Service infected 1,610 total soldiers, female commercial sex workers, prisoners and mental health patients with one of three sexually transmitted diseases - syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chancroid . Like the Tuskegee experiment, none of the human subjects were informed about the nature of the study , nor did they give consent . Unlike the Tuskegee study, however, patients in Guatemala were eventually inoculated with penicillin though it is unclear how many were actually cured . Although vulnerable adult populations have borne the brunt of unethical medical testing , children have not been spared . In the mid-nineties, the world's largest research-based drug company, Pfizer, administered the experimental drug, Trovan, during a meningitis outbreak in Kano in northern Nigeria . The parents of eleven children who died sued Pfizer , alleging that Trovan was used without their informed consent . Pfizer eventually settled out of court in 2009, promising to pay the Kano state government $75 million . For too long, the bodies of poor and vulnerable communities have been exploited to serve the medical fetishes of big pharmaceutical companies, research institutions and Western governments . Yet ,  there is a growing tide against this warped practice . In his 2014 Reith lecture series entitled 'The Future of Medicine', renowned surgeon, writer and public health researcher Dr Atul Gawande argued convincingly that the well- being of a patient is more important than his/her \"health\" . Therefore ,  the goal of medical practice should be \"caring\", and not simply \"curing\" . In the age of Ebola, it appears that the single-minded pursuit to \"cure\" has somehow superseded the Hippocratic Oath to which doctors must adhere to \"do no harm\" . The sudden race to find an antidote for Ebola- a disease that has been around since 1976- must not serve as an excuse to experiment on patients whose internal organs are at risk of shutting down . Unethical drug testing must be matched with harsh punishment, now and after Ebola . We must insist on a probe of the dubious treatment regime adopted by the Italian NGO Emergency, followed by criminal prosecution in the event of malpractice . They must answer to patients at the Lakka treatment centre in Sierra Leone .",

            "input": "TV debates: why broadcasters should give Cameron the empty chair treatment. In a short time, television debates have become a vital part of our democracy . They were watched by tens of millions of people in the 2010 general election campaign , and the Scottish referendum campaign would have been poorer without the two showdowns between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling live across all media platforms . Now is not the time to retreat from the kind of broadcasting that engages so many voters and illuminates the choices they face . Naturally, I hope all the major parties take part in the 2015 election debates . That will rightly remain the aim of the broadcasters . But I believe they should be resolute in the face of a refusal by one party to take part : the empty chair, or the deserted lectern, should be an option . The BBC guidelines do not specifically cover a national leaders' debate , but the principles they set out argue not just that they can wheel out the empty chair but that they should . On general output, BBC published editorial policy is that one reluctant participant cannot stop an item : \"The refusal of an individual or an organisation to make a contribution should not be allowed to act as a veto on the appearance of other contributors.\" That is confirmed in the various election guidelines , where over the years the ability of one awkward candidate to stop a broadcast has been removed . And the BBC and other broadcasters do use the empty chair, albeit on less high-profile occasions : if a news maker is unwilling to face the cameras , best practice is to say so and to cover the topic anyway . As far back as 1987, when I was Today's political producer, we empty-chaired Labour in a campaign debate on defence - to the fury of their leadership . But they had been given every opportunity to take part and had chosen not to , so we went ahead with the other parties and told our listeners what had happened . There is in this current row a legitimate argument about fairness and about who takes part . The arid bureaucratic view would be that this should be based on the results of the 2010 general election and therefore be a three-way debate between David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg . The rise of Ukip and the surge in multi-party politics have muddied the waters , and the broadcasters are having to be more flexible , and I think the Greens should be somewhere in the mix . However ,  I believe we can trust the BBC, ITV and Sky to come up with the right format and a proposal that offers the appropriate levels of exposure to all the parties in the UK across the whole campaign . It is for them, with the appropriate regulators, to make that judgment and not for individual politicians to seek to exclude or include their opponents . It is, in any case, inevitable that some debates of some kind will happen . The Farage v Clegg encounter just ahead of the European election campaign was an example of the asymmetry that may now happen : it was not part of a formal coverage plan , but it was compelling viewing for anyone interested in politics and millions of people tuned in . The digital debate proposed by the Guardian, Telegraph and Google is one viable alternative ; and there is nothing to stop anyone hiring a hall in Manchester and getting Miliband and Clegg to debate there . I guarantee the broadcasters would turn up , and it is significant that the opposition parties are willing to take part in debates even without the prime minister . The broadcasters may, possibly, face a legal challenge about the allocation of national airtime , but in the court of public opinion it would be a brave act to try to close down a debate in which you have been invited to take part but have chosen not to . I'm pleased to say that I don't sense the broadcasters are wavering , and they are prepared to be tough . They are right - now is the time to hold firm . At a time of lack of faith in politicians, it would be the worst option to allow game-playing to block a format that the public find valuable . Electors have a right to see their potential prime ministers live and unfiltered and at length . Those who are willing to put themselves on the line should be allowed to do so . Those who don't can watch at home and see what an empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of primetime television .",

            "input": "Chances of a TV election debate? Choose between zilch and nada. At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronounced that TV debates were \"here to stay\" . It was his confident declaration that:\"We will have them in every election in the future and that is a really good thing for democracy.\" Many others thought so too . More than 20 million people watched some or all of them . They engaged voters in ways that we hadn't seen before in Britain . To many, it was unthinkable that they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections . It gives me no pleasure to say that I have always had great doubts that this was really the case . For it to be true, you had to trust the Tory leader not to change his mind . TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances . Mr Cameron had demanded them because that is what opposition leaders nearly always do . Nick Clegg wanted to gain exposure that no previous third party leader had enjoyed . In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxious to be seen trying to connect with alienated voters . The key was Gordon Brown . Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates . His people thought he had little to lose and, in a typically Gordon Brownish way, he reckoned he would come over as the man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights . It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected . But what is most relevant to what is happening now is that it didn't work out as Mr Cameron anticipated either . The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one , presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the \"Cleggmania\" that now seems so long ago . On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC . Among those also present to comment on the results was Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster . As it became clear that his party had failed to secure a majority , he placed the blame on the TV debates . That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party . Whether it is entirely true or not, it has been engraved into the Tory soul . Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne , who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues for agreeing to the debates . The chancellor long ago told friends that he is not going to make the same mistake twice . Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates . Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chief who has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations, is another key figure who believes it is all downside for them . The first reason that David Cameron and his advisers are against debates is the traditional one . He doesn't want to concede equality of status to his opponents . The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10 that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers . The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally:\"If you are the incumbent, debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents. It is a rigged game.\" It is not, as is often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the right that most worries the prime minister . His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband . TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunity to secure mass exposure to voters sceptical that he is up to being prime minister and get them to reconsider their view . So poor are his personal ratings, Mr Miliband might only have to turn up and string together a few half-decent sentences and more people would think better of him . The hope that their man could benefit by exceeding low expectations is why Labour is desperate for debates to happen . Which makes the Tories equally desperate for them not to happen . The Conservatives, as we saw last week with their \"dodgy dossier\" about Labour's spending plans, want to revert to an old-fashioned model of election in which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' tours in which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press, to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda . So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their power to prevent TV debates from happening at this election . The broadcasters and the other parties wanted to begin negotiations about the format last spring . The Tories stalled , saying they wouldn't start talking until October . When the negotiations finally got under way, I am told, and by a variety of different sources, that the Conservatives were determined to block any progress toward agreement . \"At every stage, they sought to put obstacles in the way,\" says one source . Another confirms:\"The Tories kept throwing spanners in the works.\" According to a third:\"All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives.\" Last time around, \"a heads of agreement\" about the debates had been written by December . This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that . The last meeting was just before Christmas . \"We didn't get anywhere because of the Tories,\" says one source, an account that is again corroborated by others . I have learned that a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone . It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives . No new date has been set . The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates is that he won't do it unless the Greens are included . I happen to agree that the Greens ought to be represented in one debate . There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendation that Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as \"major\" parties for the purposes of allocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens . They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better . They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip . So I agree that it would be fair to include the Greens - and hoot with laughter to hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron . When did he become obsessed with championing the rights of minority parties? Who knew he had such a passion to debate with Natalie Bennett? In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible . By running away from debates, the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself . Says one senior government figure:\"Cameron doesn't like being called chicken.\" If the Cameron brand is supposed to be the strong and confident leader , why is he frit of debating Ed Miliband, a man the Tories keep telling us is hopelessly weak? Won't it simply look bad to deny TV debates to the voters? Yes, it will , but the Tories are calculating that any fuss will be short- lived, soon forgotten and, in the end, not that many voters will punish them for it, especially if their spinners can successfully sow confusion about who is responsible . The Tories also bargain that the press won't make that big a deal of it . About that, they may be right . There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaign that their capacity to shape the agenda was reduced by the TV debates . There are journalists and editors who will be secretly happy if they don't happen again . As things stand , I think the chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada . Could anything change that? Some suggest that the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threaten to stage debates without him - \"empty chair\" him in the jargon . Labour and the Lib Dems hope this will happen . Number 10 is assuming that the BBC wouldn't have the nerve , the other broadcasters will follow its lead , and holding a debate without Mr Cameron might anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage . A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Tories when they want to project him as the statesman floating above the fray . A more realistic way to flush him out would be to strip him of the Green figleaf he is using as his pretext for not debating . The broadcasters could redraft their proposal to include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates . Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could say that they'd be content for her to participate . I think they would . Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen on including the Greens , who have been taking votes off both of them , but when it comes to the crunch, they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all . Even then, the Tories are so determined to avoid TV debates that they'd most likely concoct another pretext for sabotaging them . But at least everyone would then be crystal clear who is to blame .",

            "input": "Why Washington should fear the silence of the anti-war movement. On this 73rd anniversary of the last declaration of war by the United States, as the Pentagon escalates its military actions in Iraq and Syria , the silence of the US peace movement carries an ominous warning for Washington, DC . The streets of major US cities are not filled with anti-war demonstrations , yet the apparent quiet does not signify consent . A look at history shows why . The US has been attacked on domestic territory twice in the past century . On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbour , killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178 others . The next day, US Congress voted to declare war on Japan , thus committing to active hostilities in World War II . That declaration of war has since proved to be the last in the history of the US . The next and last mass scale violent attack by an outside aggressor on the domestic territory of the US occurred 13 years ago, on September 11, 2001, with the immediate death toll approaching 3,000 . Three days later, Congress adopted an Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against those held responsible for the September 11 attacks . In so doing, Congress delegated war-making powers to President George W Bush under the terms of the War Powers Act of 1973 . December 7 and September 11 are notable in part because in both cases horrendous violence against the people of the US was responded to with an act of Congress . Oppose or support US entry into either of those wars, question or affirm that those wars were lawful, there was no question in either case that Congress had signed off on them . Congressional approval . It mattered that Congress approve , because Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution accords primary war powers, including the power to commence and end war, to Congress alone . For a president of the US to make war without congressional approval was an unthinkable act that would have threatened the legitimacy of the federal government . With his war on the so-called Islamic State, US President Barack Obama has committed that unthinkable act , and Congress has let him . And yet ,  by all appearances, no one outside of a handful of members of Congress, legal scholars, and peace activists has spoken out in protest . Contrast this moment with that of the weeks and months following September 11 . On September 29, 2001, upwards of 25,000 people marched through Washington, DC, against the impending invasion of Afghanistan ; tens of thousands demonstrated elsewhere throughout the US . By April 20, 2002, the anti-war protest in Washington drew over 150,000 . By February 15, national protest turnout hit 2 million . Given this history, one cannot conclude that the size and volume of anti-war protests directly resulted from the relative popularity of a particular war . After all ,  the 2001-2003 protests erupted and swelled over a period in which polls showed continued strong support among the US public for Washington's war operations . And in fact, as in 2003-2008 public opinion turned against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the size and volume of anti-war movement went down . The simple and correct explanation for this history is that anti-war organisers made decisions in 2001, 2002, and 2003, to focus their energies on mobilising street protests , and that in the years 2004-2008, as anti-war sentiment was taken up by a majority of the American people, many anti-war organisers shifted much of their focus to electing anti-war candidates to office . What has changed since Obama assumed the presidency? In Washington, in terms of war and security, very little . Guantanamo remains in operation . The police state has expanded . Assassination and missile strikes have increased . Border militarisation and deportations have escalated . And US military operations have continued and spread further across the globe . Having lived and struggled through this history, why would anti-war organisers choose to respond to Washington's undeclared, unauthorised war against the so- called Islamic State by mobilising street protests? Why would they mobilise to elect anti-war candidates? The core of the peace movement remains active in many parts of the US . Every day I receive notices about civil disobedience at military bases, hunger strikes, local government resolutions calling for a shift in spending priorities away from the military, and much more . For this reason, the relative silence of anti-war organisers in the face of the war against the so-called Islamic State stands out as a warning to the Washington establishment; those who oppose their policies question whether Congress and the presidency can provide effective redress for the grievances of the American people . Washington should fear the silence of the US anti-war movement , for it is full of sound and fury and signifies everything .",

            "input": "US economy: Why I'm optimistic about growth in 2015. Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy? Last week we got very joyful news :. All of this is good news as we ring in the new year . And the best may be yet to come . So why is the economy finally shifting into a higher gear? This isn' t a story of government-directed growth or stimulus spending . It's the opposite : Washington's role in the economy is starting to shrink after years of Obama administration activism . The private sector is starting to take over . The growth was propelled by a big rise in business investment, up nearly 9 percent; personal consumption, up 3.2 percent; and exports, up 4.5 percent . Government spending, which is a negative for the economy, grew by 4.4 percent, thanks to a big rise in military spending , but domestic spending is still restrained . The news was so good that even the threat that the Fed will now have an excuse to raise interest rates hasn't deterred the bulls on Wall Street . Here is the case for optimism going forward . First ,  a huge factor in the economic rebound has been the fall in energy costs . As the price of oil has fallen from $105 a barrel this summer to closer $70 by September,(and at the end of December it was at $53) the cost of oil imports has tumbled . Imports fell by nearly 2 percent , and this alone added almost 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth . Even that greatly understates the economic windfall from cheap energy . Production costs fall when energy costs do , so the supply of American-produced non-oil and gas products, such as manufactured goods, rises when gas is cheap . Gas prices should continue to fall , the good-news story rolls on , and the addition to GDP from energy should be even higher . Thank you, Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota . And thank you, fracking . Second , businesses are clearly feeling less trepidation about investing , and some of the wet blanket of Obama's anti-business, anti-shareholder agenda has dissipated as the Republican Congress repels his worst ideas: cap-and-trade, minimum wage hikes, new taxes on the energy industry and massive new spending initiatives out of Washington . Gridlock now looks to be built into the political system for the next two years, and in many ways that's reassuring . Third ,  government spending has fallen a lot more than people think . Despite the boost in military spending in the last quarter, the biggest story of the U.S  economy over the last three years has been the retrenchment of government spending . Federal spending has fallen from 24.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 23.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 21 percent of GDP in 2014 . Even better news is that in the fourth quarter of 2014, federal spending as a share of GDP fell to below 20 percent, according to a new analysis by Dan Clifton of Strategas, an economic policy consulting firm . This is creating an anti-Keynesian boost to growth, because the government is taking fewer private sector resources each month . The 4 percentage points less of GDP that the government is spending means 4 percent more GDP for private businesses and families to spend . That's close to $700 billion a year more for private investment and construction and spending . This, by the way, shows the foolhardiness of the Keynesian notion of a government-spending free lunch . Five years ago the Obama economics team was talking about multiplier effects from higher federal outlays -- the stimulus bill spent $830 billion-- that would juice the economy with even more private spending . It never happened . Even President Obama's own economic analysis found the economy grew more slowly than it would have without the government debt- financed spending . The real effect of government spending is to crowd out private spending . A final reason for optimism is that the incoming class of Republican governors and conservative state legislators across the country should mean more growth policies coming out of state capitals . At least a dozen governors from Massachusetts to Illinois to Tennessee are talking about tax cuts to create jobs . So even if we don't get tax reform at the federal level , states should be providing an additional tax cut stimulus . Skeptics will say that Obama's executive actions on climate change, immigration, energy policy and so on will continue to be a restraint on growth . That's for sure . This recovery from recession is still nearly $2 trillion behind where we should would be if we had a Reagan-paced boom . This is still one of the most anemic recoveries , though it is belatedly picking up steam . It's also true that wages are still flat for most workers , so the big challenge for the economy is raising productivity so Americans get a well- deserved pay raise . As 2014 comes to a close, here's where we are : Interest rates are as low as they've been in 40 years ; inflation is tame, thanks to the surge in oil and gas output ; and corporate profits remain high . The rest of the world economy, from Germany to Japan to Russia, is a debacle . But that's all the more reason to bet on the USA in 2015 . And ,  no, Mr  President, you didn't build that .",

            "input": "'Concerning Violence': Fanon lives on. In one of the more haunting scenes from Swedish documentary director Goran Hugo Olsson's Concerning Violence: Nine Scenes From the Anti-Imperialistic Self-Defense, a young Mozambican woman with a stump of a right arm breastfeeds a baby with a stump of a right leg . Like the rest of the footage in the film, the scene was unearthed from Swedish television archives dating from the era of African anti-colonial struggles . The woman and child were recorded in the immediate aftermath of an aerial bombing raid in 1972, one of Portugal's many responses to the Mozambican desire for liberation . In typical fashion, the Portuguese and their imperial colleagues instead portrayed the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) as violent terrorists, despite the merely reactive nature of anti-colonial violence to centuries of oppression . After all ,  violence is the prerogative of empire . Among Fanon's sober assessments is that colonialism \"is violence in its natural state, and it will only yield when confronted with greater violence\" . Decolonisation, he writes,\"is always a violent phenomenon\" . \"Decolonisation, which sets out to change the order of the world, is, obviously, a programme of complete disorder\" . The film corroborates these assertions with footage from former European colonial possessions in Africa . Scenes variously depict the subjugation and impoverishment of native populations, juxtaposed with Europeans sun-tanning and playing golf in picturesque African settings in between wantonly extracting resources and imprisoning and torturing people . This, in turn, provides the proper context for scenes of militant African resistance . Particularly illustrative of the prevailing\"order of the world\" is an interview with a white settler in then-Rhodesia who addresses his black servant boy as \"you stupid thing, you\" and laments the impending African reclamation of the territory : \"The gooks have got it.\" When asked by the interviewer to clarify his derogatory slang, he elaborates with more slang: \"The terrs... The whole world is supporting the terrorists.\" To be sure , we've superficially done away with the whole colonialism business, it being generally understood that colonies are bad and archaic things . There are, however, notable exceptions to the rule, as in the case of state of Israel , which is granted a de facto exemption from ceasing colonial operations and is furthermore regularly lauded as a beacon of democracy . But the same oppressive structures that underpinned colonialism continue to flourish in the age of neoliberal globalisation , which functions according to the idea that there is a class of human beings- often but not always determined by skin colour - entitled to a level of wealth and comfort that is only attainable by depriving the global masses of a dignified existence . And as always, a violent apparatus is required to secure the arrangement . In recent years, the African continent has witnessed an ever-amplified US military presence . Writing in Jacobin magazine, David Mizner describes the scenario as a \"soft occupation correspond[ing] with a battle between China and the [US] over the spoils of Africa, which has massive natural resources and six of the world's fastest growing economies\" . Poor Africans might be forgiven for failing to detect enormous differences between this and previous intrusions from abroad . In other parts of the world that the US prefers to think of as its own personal military base- such as Central America - the imperial power has backed the security forces of various repressive and illegitimate leaders committed to violently squelching popular protest . Reasons for protest have included government insistence on catering to foreign corporations rather than to indigenous and peasant communities opposed to the usurpation and contamination of their lands by mining operations and the like . But the victims are largely invisible, the dehumanised refuse of empire and the price to be paid for securing corporate profit . In her spoken preface to Concerning Violence, renowned Columbia University professor Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak explains that in \"reading between the lines\" of The Wretched of the Earth, one sees that Fanon does not in fact endorse violence but rather \"insists that the tragedy is that the very poor is reduced to violence, because there is no other response possible to an absolute absence of response and an absolute exercise of legitimised violence from the colonisers\" . Spivak goes on to make a telling comparison regarding the earth's \"wretched\":\"Their lives count as nothing against the death of the colonisers: unacknowledged Hiroshimas against sentimentalised 9/11s.\" For another modern-day example of legitimised violence and self-victimisation by the very purveyors of said violence, it seems appropriate to once again bring up the state of Israel , which shares the ex-Rhodesian resident's knack for hallucinating himself into a position of unparalleled suffering at the hands of \"terrorists\" . Following last month's Jerusalem synagogue attack in which two Palestinians murdered five Israelis, there was a typical upsurge in terror-hysteria from the Israeli establishment and sympathetic governments and media . Studiously ignored were the various Israeli crimes that directly preceded the event, not to mention this summer's slaughter of more than 2,100 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip . Meanwhile, Israel's primary benefactor - the nation described by Fanon as the \"former European colony[that] decided to catch up with Europe\"- should find much to reflect on in Concerning Violence , particularly given Fanon's conclusion regarding the European experiment:\"It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster, in which the taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appalling dimensions.\" Contemporary manifestations of the American sickness include the recent decision by a Missouri grand jury not to indict a police officer for killing an unarmed black teenager in the city of Ferguson - far from an isolated instance of fatal bigotry . Drawing on several of Fanon's texts, journalist Roqayah Chamseddine penned an essay on the aftermath of the Ferguson decision for Al-Akhbar English , in which she condemned the liberal American tradition of placing the onus of non- violence on those oppressed by the state rather than the state itself - an entity that engages in \"unfettered police brutality and judicial discrimination\" against black communities . This tradition entails an obsession with containing potentially \"violent\" black reactions to state violence (eg vandalism and looting) , and ultimately prescribes a superior concern for private property and material goods than for black life . Chamseddine writes:\"Today in the United States many will be grieving for buildings burned and windows broken, while the bourgeoisie will cry out'calm!' and hurriedly search for Martin Luther King Jr quotes to guilt black protesters into supporting their deadly liberal pacifism.\" Suffice it to say Concerning Violence should concern us all .",

            "input": "Why Vladimir Putin should be at the Auschwitz memorial ceremony. On 27 January 1945 a reconnaissance patrol from the Soviet 107th Rifle Division emerged from the snow-laden forest 70km west of Krakow . The soldiers were mounted on shaggy ponies, their submachine guns slung across their backs . In front of them stood Auschwitz-Birkenau, the grimmest symbol of modern history . Officers gazed around in disbelief, then called in medical teams to care for the 3,000 sick prisoners left behind . It is a great shame that Vladimir Putin, having not been invited, won't be present at a memorial ceremony next week to mark the 70th anniversary - at the very least, it would have reminded the world that the advance of Stalin's Red Army forced the SS to abandon the extermination camps in the east . And yet the muted row over the Russian president's absence is a reminder that this particular chapter in Russia's second world war history was, and remains, full of contradictions . . The first death camp to be liberated by the Red Army was Majdanek just outside Lublin, in July 1944 . The novelist and war correspondent Vasily Grossman was on the spot with the 8th Guards Army , which had defended Stalingrad , but an order came down that he was not to cover the story . The job was given instead to Konstantin Simonov, a favourite of the regime , who managed to avoid mentioning that any of the victims in Majdanek were Jewish . Grossman, despite warnings from his friend Ilya Ehrenburg, had been slow to believe that antisemitism could exist within the Soviet hierarchy during the death struggle with Nazism . But in 1943 he had noticed that any reference to Jewish suffering was being cut from his articles . He wrote to complain to Aleksandr Shcherbakov, the chief of the Red Army political department . Shcherbakov replied:\"The soldiers want to hear about [Russian military hero of the Napoleonic era] Suvorov, but you quote[German 19th-century poet] Heine\" . Grossman joined Ehrenburg on the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee to chronicle Nazi crimes, unaware of how dangerous this might prove to be . Several of their colleagues were murdered by the secret police . Certain truths about the Shoah could never be published . When Grossman wrote about the extermination camp of Treblinka , he could not reveal that the auxiliary guards were mostly Ukrainian . Collaboration with the enemy was a taboo subject since it undermined the rhetoric of the Great Patriotic War . As the end of the war approached, controls became even stricter . Auschwitz may have been liberated at the end of January 1945 , but no details were released until the final victory in May . The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee soon found that its work was in direct opposition to the party instruction : \"Do not divide the dead!\" Jews were not to be seen as a special category of suffering . They were to be described only as citizens of the USSR and Poland . Thus in a way Stalin was the first Holocaust denier , even if his antisemitism was not quite the same as that of the Nazis . It was probably based more on a xenophobic suspicion of international connections than on racial hatred . Soviet propaganda, while designating those killed at Auschwitz in collectively anonymous terms as \"victims of fascism\", also portrayed the extermination camp as the ultimate capitalist factory, where the workers were murdered when no longer useful . And there was a further twist away from the truth . The Stalinists emphasised how many Poles had died there to distract attention from their own crimes against the Polish people, both following the Red Army's unprovoked invasion in 1939 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and its brutal occupation from 1944 . They portrayed Auschwitz as the place of martyrdom for the Polish nation . By talking only of the Polish Catholics who had died there, they hoped that the Poles might focus any anger at their bitter fate entirely against Germany and not against the Soviet Union . Few Poles were taken in during those postwar years of Soviet oppression . And now Putin's ill-disguised attempts to reassert Russian control over Ukraine have of course reminded the Polish people all too clearly of what Soviet \"liberation\" meant for them in 1945 . It is not therefore surprising that we should be seeing a certain amount of diplomatic shadow-boxing in the background , while both sides insist everything is normal . The Kremlin is pretending not to have been snubbed by the fact that President Putin has not been asked to the commemoration event ; meanwhile, the Polish government insists it was not issuing formal invitations . The Auschwitz international committee, which includes a Russian representative, was simply asking each government who would be representing them . Putin made a speech at Auschwitz 10 years ago on the 60th anniversary , and no doubt he will again proclaim in Moscow on 9 May- Russia's Victory Day - that the Red Army's defeat of \"the fascist beast\" saved Europe from Nazi slavery . But those countries, especially Poland and the Baltic states, that experienced the ensuing 40 years of Communist dictatorship glance nervously east once more . Russia, obsessed for centuries by a fear of encirclement and surprise attack, has always felt justified in dominating its \"near abroad\" . It was Stalin's shock at Hitler's invasion in 1941, and his consequent determination to create a defensive cordon, that led to the cold war . Putin, fortunately, is a very pale imitation of his hero . o Antony Beevor's next book, Ardennes - 1944: Hitler's Last Gamble, is out in May .",

            "input": "When should voluntary euthanasia not be an option? This week a court in Belgium announced that the convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken would be put to death by a lethal injection, in spite of the fact that the death penalty is banned across Europe . Van Den Bleeken's case was unusual : having previously been declared insane and not criminally responsible, he had himself asked to be euthanised on the grounds that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in jail . Today the Belgian justice minister announced that Van Den Bleeken would not be euthanised after all, amid reports that the prisoner had changed his mind . Nonetheless ,  the case provides a fascinating twist to the old debate about euthanasia . Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowed to die? The moral defence of voluntary euthanasia is usually applied to people suffering from a terminal illness . But Van Den Bleeken isn't terminally ill and isn't in physical pain . Another traditional requirement is that the wish to die should be voluntary and competent . But how can the choices of someone who has been declared insane be regarded as voluntary and competent? The concern is that granting his request would make it a case of involuntary euthanasia , and that is usually seen as morally unacceptable . If there is an issue about Van Bleeken's sanity that is because of his alleged inability to control his sexual impulses . But it could be argued that this doesn't affect the validity of his request to be euthanised . The implication is that while some of his decisions might be involuntary or incompetent, this doesn't apply to his choice of death over a lifetime behind bars . Even so , should his request have been granted, given that he isn't terminally ill? One argument for allowing voluntary euthanasia where terminal illness isn't an issue turns on the idea of wellbeing : people should be allowed to choose death where they would literally be better off dead or where their life literally isn't worth living . Another argument turns on human autonomy : we should respect a person's free choices as long as they don't harm anyone else . Someone who is not terminally ill could still satisfy these requirements . Had Van Den Bleeken been allowed to die, critics may say it would have risked opening the floodgates for other similar cases . Belgium has seen a dramatic rise in euthanasia since the practice was legalised in 2002 and permitted in cases of pain and psychological distress, as well as terminal illness . Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia as a matter of principle . The philosopher David Velleman argues that there isn't a fundamental right to choose between life and death, and that a person's rights don't expand when they become terminally ill or psychologically distressed . He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant . According to Kant, morality requires that we respect the dignity of persons, and the dignity of persons makes them intrinsically valuable . For Kant, a person's dignity can't be traded against their wellbeing or happiness , and the fact that a person believes that their life isn't worth living doesn't make it acceptable for them to be euthanised . The Van Den Bleeken case puts pressure on these standard arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia . Suppose that, contrary to Kant's view, voluntary euthanasia is morally permissible as long as the person asking to be euthanised would be genuinely better off dead . Relatives of Van Den Bleeken's victim may well argue that the fact(if it is a fact) that he would be better off dead is precisely a reason for not allowing him to be put to death . From this perspective, euthanasia looks like a way for him to circumvent his sentence . Van Den Bleeken's victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-old he raped and strangled in 1989 . Her sisters are reported to have said that Van Den Bleeken should be forced to languish in jail , and their reaction brings out an ambivalence in how we think about the death penalty for murder . Relatives of murder victims often demand the death penalty as the ultimate punishment , but the Van Den Bleeken case suggests that, at least from the standpoint of the perpetrator, the ultimate sanction may be life behind bars . But the intrinsic value argument against voluntary euthanasia can also be hard to swallow, in this case . Christiane Remacle's sisters might balk at the idea that a murderer's life is intrinsically valuable . It's hard not to sympathise , and there remain strong reasons for not allowing Van Den Bleeken to be euthanised regardless of whether his life is intrinsically valuable . As long as euthanasia is seen as a way for him to circumvent his sentence, respect for his victim and her family demands that he isn't given the option .",

And for many that means renewed efforts at a fresh start . New Year's resolutions, we call them . This is the year . It all starts now . We resolve to turn over a new leaf - and this time we're serious . This time we're really going to try , we're not going to quit . We promise ourselves that we're going to quit bad habits and start good ones . We're going to get in shape, eat better, be more content, more disciplined, more intentional . We're going to be better husbands, wives, fathers, mothers . We're going to work harder, serve more, plan more, give more, read more . We're going to finally be all that we can be . No more messing around . Well ... I say try . Seriously, try . You might make some great strides this year . I'm hoping to . There are a lot of improvements I'm hoping to make over the next 12 months . But don't be surprised a year from now when you realize that you've fallen short... again . For those who try and try, year after year, again and again, to get better and better, only to take three steps forward then two steps back, one step forward then three steps back... I have good news for you : you're in good company! Everybody I have ever talked to sounds just like me over the years . Try and fail . Fail then try . Try and succeed . Succeed then fail . Two steps forward. One step back. One step forward. Three steps back . Every year I get better at some things, worse at others . For example ,  this past year I've become more patient with my children -- more tolerant of their mishaps . Therefore ,  I've been enjoying them more and micromanaging them less (one step forward) . But ,  due to a lack of discipline on my part, I've also allowed myself to be stretched too thin this past year and as a result, those I love most have suffered (one step back) . Furthermore ,  no matter how hard I try--no matter how serious I am about resolving to change-- I still get frustrated by the same things that frustrated me 20 years ago: traffic jams, unexpected interruptions, long lines, feeling misunderstood, and so on and so forth . You get the idea . In some ways we get better . In some ways we get worse . And in other ways we basically stay the same . Whoever told us that the experience of life was one of escalating progress lied to us . Most of the time it feels rather static, doesn't it? New Year's Resolutions are a burdensome attempt to fix ourselves and make ourselves more lovable . But (and here's the good news), God loves us as we are, not as we should be . God's love for me, approval of me, and commitment to me does not ride on my resolve but on God's resolve for me . The good news that gets me through bad times is that God's devotion to me is not dependant on my devotion . Knowing that God always meets my messes with his mercy, my failures with his forgiveness, and my guilt with his grace, helps me survive my daily disappointments with me . The Gospel of Jesus Christ is good news to those who've been crushed by unmet expectations of life -- it announces that because Jesus won for you, you're free to lose ; because Jesus was strong for you, you're free to be weak ; because Jesus was extraordinary, you're free to be ordinary ; because Jesus succeeded for you, you're free to fail . So , as this new year gets under way, I'll still going to try and get better at things , but it's so much more restful to know that I live my life from love rather than for it . Thank God! Happy New Year!",

            "input": "What freedom of speech? The photos of 40 of the world's government leaders marching arm-in-arm along a Paris boulevard on Sunday with the president of the United States not among them was a provocative image that has fomented much debate . The march was, of course, in direct response to the murderous attacks on workers at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by a pair of brothers named Kouachi, and on shoppers at a Paris kosher supermarket by one of the brothers' comrades . The debate has been about whether President Obama should have been at the march . The march was billed as a defense of freedom of speech in the West ; yet it hardly could have been held in a less free speech-friendly Western environment , and the debate over Obama's absence misses the point . In the post-World War II era, French governments have adopted a policy advanced upon them nearly 100 years ago by Woodrow Wilson . He pioneered the modern idea that countries' constitutions don't limit governments; they unleash them . Thus , even though the French Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, French governments treat speech as a gift from the government, not as a natural right of all persons , as our Constitution does . The French government has prohibited speech it considers to be hateful and even made it criminal . When the predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo once mocked the death of Charles de Gaulle, the French government shut it down -- permanently . The theory of anti-hate speech laws is that hate speech often leads to violence, and violence demands police and thus the expenditure of public resources, and so the government can make it illegal to spout hatred in order to conserve its resources . This attitude presumes, as Wilson did when he prosecuted folks for publicly singing German songs during World War I, that the government is the origin of free speech and can lawfully limit the speech it hates and fears . It also presumes that all ideas are equal, and none is worthy of hatred . When the massacres occurred last week in Paris, all three of the murderers knew that the police would be unarmed and so would be their victims . It was as if they were shooting fish in a barrel . Why is that? The answer lies in the same mentality that believes it can eradicate hate by regulating speech . That mentality demands that government have a monopoly on violence, even violence against evil . So, to those who embrace this dreadful theory, the great loss in Paris last week was not human life, which is a gift from God ; it was free speech, which is a gift from the state . Hence the French government, which seems not to care about innocent life, instead of addressing these massacres as crimes against innocent people, proclaimed the massacres crimes against the freedom of speech . Would the French government have reacted similarly if the murderers had killed workers at an ammunition factory, instead of at a satirical magazine? And how hypocritical was it of the French government to claim it defends free speech! In France, you can go to jail if you publicly express hatred for a group whose members may be defined generally by characteristics of birth, such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion . You can also go to jail for using speech to defy the government . This past weekend, millions of folks in France wore buttons and headbands that proclaimed in French:\"I am Charlie Hebdo.\" Those whose buttons proclaimed\"I am not Charlie Hebdo\" were asked by the police to remove them . Those who wore buttons that proclaimed, either satirically or hatefully,\"I am Kouachi\" were arrested . Arrested for speech at a march in support of free speech? Yes . What's going on here? What's going on in France, and what might be the future in America, is the government defending the speech with which it agrees and punishing the speech with which it disagrees . What's going on is the assault by some in radical Islam not on speech, but on vulnerable innocents in their everyday lives in order to intimidate their governments . What's going on is the deployment of 90,000 French troops to catch and kill three murderers because the government does not trust the local police to use guns to keep the streets safe or private persons to use guns to defend their own lives . Why do some in radical Islam kill innocents in the West in order to affect the policies of Western governments? Might it be because the fruitless Western invasion of Iraq killed 650,000 persons, most of whom were innocent civilians? Might it be because that invasion brought al-Qaida to the region and spawned ISIS? Might it be because Obama has killed more innocent civilians in the Middle East with his drones than were killed by the planes in the U.S  on 9/11? Might it be because our spies are listening to us, rather than to those who pose real dangers? What does all this have to do with freedom of speech? Nothing -- unless you believe the French government .",

            "input": "What is not being reported in Azerbaijan. While global media appears to be focused on debating the limitations on free speech in France following the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo , it is worth remembering that France is not the only country whose media professionals are targeted . For years, journalists in Azerbaijan have suffered harsh penalties for defending their freedom of speech- from prison sentences to interrogation and the confiscation of broadcasting equipment . On December 26, at around 10:30am, a group of police officers and investigators stormed the Baku bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty , ransacking the company's safe, seizing company documents, the official seal and equipment , while keeping the staff hostage in a conference room for over five hours . Once the search was over, the office was sealed shut . The staff was let go only to be forcefully summoned a day later at the heavy crimes unit of the state prosecutor's office for questioning . In just a few days, over 30 former and current staff members of RFE/RL were questioned, including the bureau's cleaner . On December 30, the government accused the radio and its staff of espionage, money laundering and appropriation of funds as part of the ongoing criminal investigation against foreign-funded entities in Azerbaijan . Similar measures were taken against Institute for Reporters' Freedom and Safety (IRFS), the Media Rights Institute, and International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX) . The offices of all three were raided in August and sealed shut with IREX leaving the country shortly after . The director of IRFS, Emin Huseynov, remains in hiding . Consistent targeting . This is not the first time the RFE/RL station, locally called Azadliq Radio (Liberty Radio) is targeted by the authorities . In 2009, its FM broadcast was shut down . BBC radio service and Voice of America followed suit . For years, the police harassed the radio's reporters, often confiscating or breaking their equipment or detaining them for endless hours of interrogation . On December 5, Azadliq Radio investigative journalist and the host of the radio's daily show, Khadija Ismayilova, was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention for two months . Accused of \"incitement to suicide\" or \"an attempt to suicide\" as per Article 125 of the Criminal Code, Ismayilova remains in jail  - even though her accuser, Tural Mustafayev, has withdrawn his complaint . Mustafayev had accused Ismayilova of inciting him to attempt suicide and \"insulting his honour and dignity on social networks and among her friends following the break-up of their relations and his intention to marry another woman\" . On December 30, the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed Ismayilova's appeal for house arrest . Prior to this charge, Ismayilova was already facing an unrelated criminal trial for defamation linked to her posting a document on Facebook revealing the identity of a man who was an informant for Azerbaijan's intelligence services . In October, when travelling for a conference in Prague, Ismayilova was prevented from leaving the country . A little over a week before this trip, Ismayilova was searched and detained for four hours at Baku International Airport . She was returning from Strasbourg where she talked about the deteriorating human rights conditions in Azerbaijan . Her investigative work uncovered many of the hidden and illegal business dealings of the ruling Aliyev family and other government officials for which she is recognised internationally . Ismayilova is the recipient of Global Shining Award, the Gerd Bucerius Free Press of Eastern Europe Award, the Courage of Journalism Award, and named one of the Brave Thinkers of the world by Atlantic magazine . Was it a coincidence that Ismayilova's detention came just a day after the country's chief of staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, accused Ismayilova of treason and being a foreign spy? Or that the radio station was raided and then closed in another few weeks time? In his 60-page diatribe on \"Western Colonialism\", Mehdiyev wrote:\"Their main concern is lip service to their bosses abroad and keeping good relations with them . The example is Azadliq Radio's journalist Kahdija Ismayilova . Together with her colleague 'friends' she puts on anti-Azerbaijani shows, makes absurd statements, openly demonstrates destructive attitude towards well-known members of the Azerbaijani community, and spreads insulting lies . It is clear this sort of defiance pleases Ms Ismayilova's patrons abroad.\" He concluded:\"Overall there is an understanding within the society that Azadliq Radio and its employees are on a disgusting path . There is no need to prove that provision of false information is the same as working for the foreign secret service . This is treason . This is what journalists and people with a healthy mindset would think . If the symbol of democracy is Khadija Ismayilova , then it is awful to imagine what future awaits the society.\" Siyavush Novruzov, an MP from the ruling party, agrees . In an interview with a local news site, Novruzov said:\"Every place that works for foreign intelligence and the Armenian lobby should be searched.\" The Armenian lobby is just another popular tool used by government circles to punish dissent in Azerbaijan . Despite its support for Track Two diplomacy initiatives, Aliyev's regime was quick to accuse Leyla Yunus and Rauf Mirkadirov of treason and spying for Armenia this year . Both Yunus and Mirkadirov have been engaged in public diplomacy initiatives pressing for reconciliation between Armenia and Azerbaijan for over a decade . The authorities were fully aware of their work for years . And yet ,  in what has been by far the most unprecedented year of crackdowns, Azerbaijan continues to maintain a steady relationship with Europe and the image of a transforming country, young and rich, and eager to spend so long as its critics keep quiet . With many of the country's prominent advocates, lawyers, and journalists in jail; independent media platforms under attack; and only a handful of international non-governmental organisations left in the country, there is little hope for the country's positive transformation anytime soon . So long as President Ilham Aliyev keeps saying there are no political prisoners and no limitations on freedom of speech in Azerbaijan- conjuring the illusion of a democratic country- little is going to change in this country .",

            "input": "Where Afghan law fails women. Afghan women have come a long way since the dark days of the Taliban regime . Yet a key obstacle to this progress continues to be high levels of violence against women . The legal system has failed to protect women adequately when it comes to some of the most common crimes against them; rape, domestic violence, underage and forced marriages . That is why, in 2009, a number of prominent Afghan women's rights activists, members of civil society groups, and some lawmakers came together to draft a bill to better protect women through legal channels and to define crimes of violence against women . The bill, known as The Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law, was decreed into law through an Executive Order by the former Afghan President Hamid Karzaion, on July 20, 2009, while parliament was in recess . During such periods, the Afghan Constitution allows the president to issue decrees for emergency purposes , but the Constitution also requires such decrees to be forwarded to parliament for approval . Some women activists nonetheless suggested that it was not necessary to send the EVAW law to parliament . Political climate . Others, including myself, argued that although the Executive Order on EVAW was a significant step in the battle for the elimination of violence against women, the law remained vulnerable to being reversed by a new president . Indeed ,  presidential elections were just around the corner . As the drawdown of the international troops drew nearer, we feared that the political climate would make it increasingly difficult to get the law anchored in parliament . In addition ,  we feared that any peace talks with the Taliban could end up sacrificing EVAW in a bid to appease the militants . Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition in protecting it against extremist attacks . In order to get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament, we worked tirelessly for months, using three main strategies . Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those who opposed the law, mainly conservatives . Secondly, we went to visit them in their houses, explaining the law to them article by article to obtain their signature in support of the law . We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries so they could explore how these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades . Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two years to develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives . In late 2009, there were only two issues left where conservative MPs did not agree . These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the fact that women's rights advocates wanted to include \"honour killings\" as a specific crime in the law . At this point, however, MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010 , thus the process lost momentum . Unfortunately, after the 2010 parliamentary elections, we ended up with a more conservative parliament . Contested election results left the new parliament paralysed for almost a year . As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011 . At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions . All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions . The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments . Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposal to have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan . As before, we rejected the proposals to leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts . We similarly rejected a new suggestion which was to close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violence to stay with relatives instead . Although the opponents were vocal , they did not outnumber the rest . What was damaging, however, was an unhealthy political rivalry that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW . Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, argued that the time was not right to pass the EVAW and that it should be left as a presidential decree . There were good reasons for seeking parliamentary approval . Yet some of my colleagues began accusing me of using the bill to further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections . Instead of supporting EVAW, many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill and some even went as far as to lobby against it . As a result, when the law was presented to the plenary in May 2013, conservative MPs who were opposed to EVAW were further emboldened . The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence and probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either . With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failed to pass . Those of us who saw the passing of EVAW to be beyond politics, and understood its importance for tackling violence against women, were left heartbroken . With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women . We have made important gains since 2001 , but we need the force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements . We need to arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW law to fight the violence and other ills of our society which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country . The fact that the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliament is the reason for its weak implementation rates ; many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it . One promising thing on the horizon is that we now have a president and chief executive who both understand the multitude of challenges facing women . I would like to take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah to declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill . I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partners to set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill . As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows, when the government and others make something a priority, the conservative MPs can be isolated . Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan , differences may be wide and security challenges are growing , but failure to back the EVAW and allowing it to die will deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights .",

To many people overseas, the United States government is viewed as an aggressive empire of military bases, drones, and special forces that transcend national borders . But to big corporations, the US government is a patsy that gives away trillions of dollars of natural resources, tax revenues and public assets to grasping giant companies and industries . The US has an unsurpassed record of transferring what belongs to all Americans to a few giant business interests . Unlike any other country, the federal government, under the 1872 Mining Act, gives away hard rock minerals (eg gold, silver, platinum, molybdenum) discovered on federal lands that belong to the American people, to the foreign or domestic companies that find these minerals . In 1986, for example, a gold company found over $9bn worth of gold under federal land in Nevada . The company bought rights to that gold for $5 per acre(less than $6,000 total) without having to pay any royalties on the mined gold back to the Department of Interior . For over 100 years, valuable minerals worth hundreds of billions of dollars have been given away to the mining industry for $5 or less per acre . Once these mines are exhausted, the law only requires companies to do little to clean up their toxic waters and waste . As for other natural resources on federal land such as timber, grazing fields, oil, gas and coal, the companies pay very low fees to the government to obtain these valuable natural resources . The public airwaves belong to the people . Yet ,  under a law passed in 1934 by the radio lobby (sustained later by the television industry), the broadcasting stations control their licensed portion of the broadcast spectrum 24/7 for free . As tenants they pay nothing to the Federal Communications Commission , which represents the landlords , who are the people . These free licenses allow radio and television stations to exclusively decide who gets airtime and who does not . Entertainment and advertisements now make up over 90 percent of the broadcasting time of these very profitable commercial stations, using our public airwaves . For many decades, the federal government has used taxpayer-funded research and development as hand-outs for private industries in the US . For instance ,  the research and development of the Pentagon has resulted in technologies that built the aero-space, computer and containerisation industries . It was the Pentagon that funded the basic and applied research that led to the creation of the Internet . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has transferred, for free, many diverse technologies that were developed through taxpayer-funded research and development to the transportation, detection and medical service industries . The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded many of the major pharmaceuticals which, under contracts known as CRADA agreements, are given away to large drug companies . The anti-cancer drug, Taxol, was developed with $31m of taxpayer funds by the National Cancer Institute and, after clinical testing, given away to Bristol- Myers-Squibb under a monopoly marketing agreement . The biotechnology industry was formed out of free NIH research programmes . Without a century of freely transferred research and development investments by the US Department of Agriculture, pesticide, herbicide and other chemical industries would not be where they are today . At the state and local level, companies and their consulting firms put the location of new factories, warehouses or large retail stores up for bidding by the states and municipalities . It becomes a race to the bottom by states and municipalities competing against each other to create the most \"business friendly environment\" with incentives like tax breaks, cash donations and other subsidies to convince companies to locate to a community called corporate welfare or crony capitalism . These deals amount to governments paying companies to make money while depleting their public tax base that pays for schools, public works and other public services . Recently, Tesla, the electric car company, put the location of a proposed one billion dollar factory to produce lithium ion batteries up for bid . Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada offered large giveaways in incentive subsidies . Nevada won, offering a package worth at least $1bn that included tax vacations, cash reimbursements of expenses and even a cash bonus for signing . Similarly ,  professional sports businesses have routinely demanded taxpayer- funded stadiums and ballparks as a condition of either staying in a city or relocating to another . Many billions of dollars have been spent to make these rich football and baseball giants even richer . This is money that could have been spent to create and improve neighbourhood recreational facilities for participatory sports and healthy exercise . Under those corporate subsidies, the taxpayers are paying far too much (sometimes between $100,000 to $200,000 per job) for their governments' race to the bottom during these bidding wars . There are many thousands of similar corporate subsidy programmes , which are not regularly reviewed by the federal government . Instead ,  Congress just lets them continue on indefinitely without regulatory standards, cost-benefit tests or sunset provisions , which is exactly what these corporate lobbyists are paying for with their ample campaign contributions to these indentured legislators . The most profitable companies in the world make demands for such subsidies . Some years ago the former CEO of Intel Corporation, Andy Grove, testified before the Senate urging continuation of the generous tax credits given to computer companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Google, and Apple . These are companies with staggering profit margins, year after year . Grove was candid when he told the Senators that his industry was not very eager to spend money to do basic research . What these companies do, he noted, is apply the research to their products and services . He called on the government to take this responsibility by extending tax credits (big checks) from the Treasury to pay companies to do such basic work . The unfairness of all these giveaways is inducing a Left-Right alliance that opposes such giveaways . The Left calls this corporate welfare , while the Right calls it crony capitalism . Thus far, the politicians from both the Democratic and the Republican parties have not wanted to make these giveaways debatable issues in their electoral campaigns or the subject of thorough congressional or state legislative hearings . The time is coming for a Left-Right public coalition to go operational and exert political demands for reform of this gigantic largesse , while many other necessities of the people are subjected to cruel, austere cutbacks .",

            "input": "Who is a German? A spectre is haunting Germany and Europe and the spectre is called PEGIDA . Until recently only a few people had heard of PEGIDA, acronym for \"Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident.\" It started as a small protest movement in the eastern city of Dresden against the influx of immigrants, foreign workers and asylum seekers and, above all, against the \"Islamisation\" of Germany . Adopting the slogan\"We are the people\" of the weekly anti-communist demonstrations in 1989 which ultimately led to the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic, PEGIDA's appeal seems to have grown week after week . The hundreds of demonstrators of the first few Monday evening \"walks\" in Dresden have swollen to tens of thousands . Besides Dresden, there are now similar weekly rallies in other big German cities . With its history of anti-Semitism and fascism many find it shocking that a considerable number of Germans, particularly in the east of the country, are flocking to a xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic movement . The surge of the anti-Islamisation movement has led to polarisation of the public opinion, many counter demonstrations and a fierce public debate, involving politicians, church leaders and academics . Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticised PEGIDA and called on Germans not to attend their rallies . \"Do not follow the people who organise these, for their hearts are cold and often full of prejudice, and even hate,\" Merkel said in her New Year's Eve speech . Marginalised . Not everybody agrees . Development Minister Gerd Muller of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), warned not to exclude PEGIDA sympathisers . \"The overwhelming majority of those demonstrators are not racists at all . Many of them are low income Germans and they feel they are being neglected, while refugees are offered help . The refugees, but also other migrants, are perceived by these people as competitors . In spite of our flourishing economy there are millions of poor families in Germany . The poor feel marginalised and not represented.\" The CSU, Merkel's CDU's sister party and longtime political ally, has been accused of showing a bit too much understanding for PEGIDA . In fact the CSU's positions on immigration, integration and tougher rules for asylum seekers are quite similar to PEGIDA's . It may well be that the CSU is distancing itself from Merkel because it is worried about right-wing competitors like the anti-establishment and eurosceptic AfD, Alternative fur Deutschland (Germany's Alternative) . The AfD may succeed in winning over many of the PEGIDA-sympathisers . AfD-chairman Bernd Lucke has gone out of his way to advocate a dialogue with this \"new civil movement\" and listen carefully to its arguments . At the same time Lucke tried carefully not to alienate the more \"respectable\" right-wing voters and to distance himself from a too xenophobic discourse . Other AfD leaders are less ambiguous and clearly show support of PEGIDA by participating in their marches and inviting PEGIDA organisers to Saxony's regional parliament . Some German observers don't doubt the existence of an alliance between AfD and PEGIDA . Analyst Volker Wagener sees the AfD as the \"parliamentary voice of the street\" . He notes that the AfD manages to score with a xenophobic discourse especially in the east of Germany . If the AfD succeeds in translating PEGIDA's objectives politically and electorally , it may take a role not unsimilar to Marine le Pen's National Front in France and especially Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands . In fact ,  there is a striking similarity between the anti- Islamisation positions of Geert Wilders and PEGIDA . Like Wilders' Freedom Party, PEGIDA does not only condemn jihadists and Islamist terrorists but Islam itself . Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and the islamic religion are all lumped together in a vague, scary, threatening mix . Both the Freedom Party and PEGIDA claim to defend the \"conservation of the Judeo-Christian heritage\" . Both claim not to be radical , but PEGIDA and Wilders' party do in fact appeal to right wing radicals and extremists . Neo- Nazis and violent\"hooligans against Salafists\" openly support PEGIDA . Both forces represent a significant portion of the population in Germany and the Netherlands . If there would be parliamentary elections in the Netherlands now, Wilders' Freedom Party would be the first or second political force in the country (depending on which poll to believe) . In Germany, around 30 percent of the population thinks PEGIDA's concerns are legitimate . Some German experts say the debate shows the need for a redefinition of\"who is a German\" and recognition of Germany as an immigration country . According to a recent study, most Germans see somebody as \"German\" when he or she speaks German well and has a German passport . Some 38 percent of those polled said that women who wore headscarves could not be German . To define a new concept of \"German-ness\" and promote a welcoming culture of tolerance and openness will not be an easy task, and should probably not be left to the politicians .",

            "input": "Why CIA interrogations report matters: Torture doesn't work and Americans need to know. As a former professional interviewer with the FBI, I know what works and doesn't . Torture is not an effective way to get information , and the American people need to know that . That's why the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation and detention after 9/11 is important . The executive summary of the report, written after reviewing hundreds of thousands of the CIA's internal documents, shows that torture was more brutal and much less fruitful than the CIA claimed . In fact ,  the committee concluded that all the claims about the value of intelligence gained from \"enhanced\" interrogation--including the claim that it helped the U.S  find Usama bin Laden-- are overstated or just plain false . Proponents of torture are contesting these well-documented findings . So let's look at the facts . On 9/11, the CIA had few, if any, experienced counterterrorism interrogators . Their traditional purview had been intelligence collection during the Cold War . Inexperienced in this area and overwhelmed they resorted to techniques that merely sounded good but in fact worked against them . When concocting the legal opinions to authorize torture, the lawyers inside our government didn't consult trained interviewers or interrogation experts--the people who actually knew how to get information . They consulted psychologists who helped train U.S  military pilots to resist torture methods should they be captured (torture methods, it should be noted, designed to elicit false confessions) . If they had consulted trained interviewers , they would have found out what I and my colleagues had known for decades: Torture isn't just unnecessary; it's an unreliable way to get information . Instead , as the Senate report shows, the CIA brought in untrained interrogators and contractors and asked them to get answers out of Al Qaeda detainees using methods designed to inflict pain, both physical and mental, and even simulate death . The CIA also employed horrific methods, like forced rectal feedings, that were never approved . I recall when I learned that cruel techniques were being used . I spoke with several long-term CIA officers and CIA polygraph experts with whom I had worked over many years , and we were all appalled , not just by its immorality , but because we knew it would be counterproductive . Apologists say that these methods were used to put the detainees into a state of \"learned helplessness,\" in which the detainee would depend totally on his captor and give up all information . Those of us who have actually conducted interviews know that this isn't the way things work . To get good, accurate information, you want the subject to be as cognizant as possible . You want him to be able to remember all the details and to be able to tell you them . A person will say anything to try to stop the pain , and torture impairs the suspect's ability to remember the details that may be essential to your investigation . Professionals don't need to use torture and never have . On top of that, torture is illegal, both here in the U.S  and internationally . The United States has even prosecuted people for the methods that the CIA used after 9/11 . We are a nation of laws , and the conduct detailed in the Senate report is against the law . For these reasons, in October, I joined 22 other security, interrogation and interviewing experts to issue a statement of principles in opposition to using torture . Not only is torture less reliable, illegal and immoral, we write , but it also makes our nation less safe . When we are not using effective and legal interviewing tactics, we miss information that may be vital to our nation's safety . In using torture, we also encourage other nations and actors (including terrorist groups) to emulate our illegal actions, effectively lowering the bar for the rest of the world, and allow them to use U.S  torture as a recruiting tool . President Obama, on his second day in office, signed an executive order banning the CIA torture methods the Senate report describes . But this executive order could be overturned by a future president . Now that the Senate report's executive summary has been released and the public knows the just how ineffective and brutal U.S  torture was, we need to make sure that this prohibition is permanent . Working with Congress to pass legislation that makes sure a ban on torture extends to the CIA is one way that President Obama can make sure that the United States never again embraces the misguided, ineffective, and dangerous tactics of torture .",

            "input": "Why #illridewithyou is an ill ride. The Sydney siege saw a slew of Muslim organisations issue statements condemning Islamic extremism . Such chastisement had meant something in the wake of 9/11 and the Bali bombings . Today, this has degraded into an automated knee-jerk response . It has been said so many times that its gravitas is greatly diminished . More subtly, this expectation for Muslims to keep speaking out is nothing short of Islamophobic . It assumes that Islam is, at its core, evil . It also upholds the view that Muslims can be essentialised as a monolithic whole . The chastisement thus becomes the yardstick from which the wider world is to differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim . Surely today, fourteen years after 9/11, we have wisened up to the fact that such atrocious acts are committed out of political, even criminal, intent more than theology . Surely, it is not a stretch to think that no one individual can represent an entire faith community . Surely, it is time, as Max Fisher of Vox argues, to stop asking Muslims to condemn terrorism . In the same manner, this good Muslim, bad Muslim binary undergirds the #illridewithyou campaign . Yes, the hashtag was borne out of goodwill ; an Asian Australian woman started it , as the Twitter universe reacted to the story of a woman pledging to walk in solidarity with another woman who took her hijab off following news of the Sydney siege . We will protect the good Muslims, so gestures the campaign . Unfortunately, it also reproduces an age-old trope that has been highlighted by scholars of postcolonial studies . As western colonisers encounter non-European natives, they began to think of their \"other\" in one of two antithetical ways - either as a barbaric savage or a noble savage . To the colonisers, the hostile savage is inherently dangerous in a sub-human way and always an enemy to the civilised individual . Meanwhile, the noble savage is romanticised as innately benign . Untouched by modernisation, the noble savage should be admired and protected . Transposed to modern times, the hostile savage translates as the bad Muslim and the noble savage - the good Muslim . Yet ,  barbaric or noble, a savage is still a savage . The hashtag #illridewithyou is just as patronising . Another factor that cast doubt to #illridewithyou relates to this question: Was the perpetrator Man Haron Monis the quintessential Islamic extremist? If the slate of profile pieces that are now just flooding our newsfeed can be taken as a gauge , the jury is still out on this . At first glance, one may indeed be tempted to fit him into the mould of what some security experts have called\"bedroom jihadists\", a fashionable term to describe self-radicalised individuals who have been recruited online to plan and execute terror attacks that would advance the cause of clandestine Islamist organisations . Yet Monis was a man of many masks . Closer inspection would reveal that he does not nestle comfortably into this category . His demands may have included an ISIL flag , but he made no strategic overtures that would advance the cause of any oppressed Muslim groups . At this juncture, it is doubtful if he had even made contact with ISIL . Let us also not forget that Monis was not a nobody who was secretly being turned to the ways of ISIL or any other Islamist agenda . In fact ,  he was a well-known criminal . Not only had Monis been charged with being an accessory to the brutal murder of his wife last year, he had also been slapped with 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault . In addition ,  information has surfaced that he had been charged with fraud in Iran , which requested his extradition from Australia some 14 years ago . As a friend rightly pointed out on social media, Monis' criminal records qualify him as a \"sexual predator and misogynist\" . Yet ,  this more dominant aspect of his identity has not stopped the rest of the world from linking the Sydney siege to the threat of Islamic fundamentalism . Yet consider this . During the Sydney siege, a shooting spree incidence unfolded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that left 6 dead . International media agencies described the perpetrator, the now-deceased Bradley William Stone, simply as \"a suspect\", \"a gunman on the loose\" and even \"a Montgomery man\" . No hashtag campaign was necessary to assure white people that the rest of the world will ride with them to keep them safe . The same can be observed of the reaction to the mass killings committed by the Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011 . While Breivik had claimed himself a baptised Christian in his 1,500-page manifesto , the world did not expect Christians to condemn terrorism in the same way Muslims had . This discrepancy is telling of the power imbalance of our contemporary world . To white Australia, #illridewithyou may be its golden moment . To the rest of the coloured world, nothing has changed .",

            "input": "The widening war in the Middle East. It has been a week of air strikes \"whodunnit\" mysteries in the Middle East . Firstly, Al Jazeera broke the news that Iranian F-4 Phantoms were bombing ISIL in Iraq . The Iranians initially denied being in the same airspace bombing the same enemies as the Americans but later came clean about their role to the Guardian . We've also heard rumours of the US A-10 \"tank buster\" arriving to support the US mission in Iraq although, again, nothing has been confirmed at this point . Then ,  on as normal a Sunday as Damascus has experienced in the last few years, the Syrian regime released grainy photographs supposedly showing the trails of Israeli aircraft following a bombing run on targets in the area . Among the rumoured sites that were hit were areas of Damascus International Airport . This caps a busy weekend for Syria's airbases which withstood ISIL attacks in the east of the country on Saturday . While at a tactical level it is impossible to understand what impact the strikes have had , at a political level it works for all sides . The Syrian regime has used its conflict with Israel to justify an internal state of emergency and restrictions to freedoms for decades and can now sell to the war weary public who remain in their controlled areas, the twin threat of ISIL and Israeli \"terrorism\" . For Benjamin Netanyahu, with elections looming, there is no better time for Israel's prime minister to act \"prime ministerial\" and remind voters of his eternal vigilance of the threat coming from Syria . Indeed ,  earlier in the week, Netanyahu said that Israel \"is following the Middle East and what is happening very closely, with wide open eyes and ears- and a lot is happening ... We will continue to keep our fingers on the pulse and we will deal with these threats and these challenges, which never take time off\" . In a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Syria's foreign ministry claimed the bombing happened to distract from the break up of Netanyahu's coalition . Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman saying he would not comment on the \"foreign reports\" . While Syrian state media should always be read with a healthy pinch of salt , if confirmed , the latest Israeli attack comes in a series that preceded the outbreak of civil war . There is a certain format to this low level state of eternal conflict between the two parties . Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time . Following the attacks, Syria responded with bombastic rhetoric over what it would do in the face of the strikes but nothing ever happened . Since the Syrian uprising and civil war, Israel's primary concern has been with certain types of hi-tech weaponry going to Hezbollah , which was used to explain strikes in January and May of 2013 . A year later and Israel responded to the very physical spillover of the Syrian conflict by launching strikes in June 2014 after shells were fired at their positions on the Golan Heights . Syria responded to the January bombings by warning of a \"surprise\" , but in fact their actual reaction has been predictably mute . The airspace over Syria has never been busier with different nations pursuing different enemies with metrics of success hard to distinguish among the smoke and debris of the destruction . This weekend's attacks, if they are eventually claimed by Israel, would further entrench the growing irrelevance of many of the region's borders as recognised and respected lines . While the focus of global attention has been on ISIL's dismantling of the Iraq-Syria border , the Lebanon-Syria border is also becoming functionally blurred and clearly no longer deters Israel's strategic decision makers . At the most immediate level, the strikes will likely embolden Assad to play a traditional nationalist card to strengthen support among his remaining loyalists . Over in Israel, Netanyahu can appear to be making statesmanlike decisions ahead of a likely bruising election and it cannot be a coincidence that he was in the US when the bombing happened - a nod perhaps to a US green light and the durability of that continued relationship .",

I lived there and helped U.S  companies negotiate trade deals and contracts , but it was not a glamorous job . I spent my last night in China in June 1989 in a baggage X-ray machine at the Beijing Airport as tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square . Only one bus full of Japanese tourists made it to the airport the next morning , and I sneaked out of my hiding place and slipped into their lines ... unnoticed . Not long after that I watched on television as a brave young man tried to block a phalanx of tanks heading into the square . The world learned something very important that day: Get in the way of the Chinese Communist Party and you'll be crushed . The Chinese economy is now estimated by some to be larger than our own . Radio talk show host Mark Levin even predicted on his show that the U.S  would lose its technological advantage to the Chinese within 10 years . How will this happen? Will China send its tanks to New York City and invade the banks, or to Silicon Valley to steal away our intellectual property? No need to ; we're actually handing them our wealth . And ,  oddly enough, many seem pretty content about it . I'm not a protectionist , but I'm no sucker, either . Preserving free markets takes work , but what's strange is that today we're actively distorting markets to the detriment of our domestic industries . History is replete with governments working against Adam Smith's invisible hand, but always with the intention of protecting their own . We're doing the opposite . There has been a debate brewing for decades within conservative circles over whether Congress should give deference to the 10th Amendment and allow States to control their own sales tax systems, or whether they should be prevented from collecting sales taxes on goods sold online under the guise of lower taxes . In my mind there's nothing conservative or free market about protecting businesses from competition . Since online shopping became the rage a decade and a half ago , Americans have enjoyed buying items -- from home necessities to Christmas presents -- without paying sales tax . I made up my mind on this issue in the 1990s after I kept hearing some politicians assert that Internet companies must be nurtured and protected while in their infancy . There' s nothing conservative or free market about protecting businesses from competition . Amazon and eBay look extremely well nurtured after decades of special tax treatment , while mom-and-pop Main Street retailers have been forced to charge sales tax . Well, a game changer named Alibaba, a billion-dollar Chinese e-commerce marketplace that's bigger than Amazon and eBay,combined, is now entering the American market . Fresh off the largest IPO in Wall Street history and flush with cash, within two years Alibaba and its hundreds of thousands of Chinese retailers will be selling the same goods and products to Americans the same way Amazon does . It's bad enough that local stores have had to compete on a tilted playing field against American e-tailers , but extending this uncompetitive advantage to subsidized overseas giants like Alibaba could spell the end for countless American business owners . Congress has the power to change this , and the U.S  Senate has already overwhelmingly voted 69-27 to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act to close the online sales tax loophole . Even Amazon, which fought closing the sales tax loophole for years, now supports the Marketplace Fairness Act . Conservatives in the Senate were divided on this vote , my hope is state legislatures will follow conservative Gov  Scott Walker's lead in Wisconsin and pass laws offsetting any revenue increases with corresponding income tax cuts . Conservatives should be of one mind to keep taxes as low as possible , and we can also work to ensure that markets remain free and competitive . It is now up to the House of Representatives to decide if they're going to stand up for small businesses or cut them off at the knees with a wet kiss for Alibaba . If you're kissing Alibaba , you're essentially in bed with the Chinese government and its Communist Party , which cares even less about the American economy than it cared for the heroic student who stood in front of the tanks in Tiananmen Square . As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial put it :. \"[N]o one in China earns or keeps such wealth or celebrity without support from the Communist Party . ... [Alibaba's Chairman Jack] Ma recently accompanied President Xi Jinping on a state visit to South Korea , and a strong IPO debut could yield billion-dollar payouts for Beijing's sovereign wealth fund and several private investment firms tied to children and grandchildren of Party leaders.\" Why on earth would conservatives and Republicans want to undercut the local small businesses they claim to represent in favor of an online retailing Goliath backed by the Chinese government? This would be the height of lunacy . A standard talking point for GOP leaders, office holders and candidates has been to strongly advocate for small business . If House Republicans don't close this loophole , the damage done to the GOP's relationship with one of its core constituencies could be irreparable . How many GOP incumbents want to see this ad run against them in the next election? It would be both good politics and good policy to close the loophole so everyone - including Alibaba - has to compete by the same rules . That is, after all, what a free market is all about . Dan Schneider is executive director of the American Conservative Union .",

It's been over twenty years since then - Bikini Kill frontwoman and Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna scrawled the word SLUT across her stomach . In the years since, there's been a book called Slut! , countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word \"slut\" and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks - a reference to how victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them . Like \"cunt\" and \"bitch\", many feminists have long tried to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word \"slut\" and to give it new meaning . Increasingly, though, it's seeming like we might not succeed any time soon . Take Leora Tanenbaum: in 2000, she wrote Slut!: Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation chronicling girls' and women's experiences with the word . She herself was called a \"slut\" as a high school student in the 1980s - long before the term \"sexual harassment\" was coined - and told me\"I had no vocabulary to understand what happened.\" Now, 15 years later, Tanenbaum is about to publish another book: I Am Not a Slut because, in part, the sheen of reclaiming \"slut\" seems to have worn off over the years . When she spoke to women who called themselves \"sluts\" with a \"positive and defiant\" spirit, all told her the decision had turned against them later- and all regretted it . Tanenbaum told me that, when women are in closed circle or close-knit community - like a protest with like-minded people, or among friends who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word - identifying as a \"slut\" can be empowering . But what inevitably happens, especially in today's digital culture where revenge porn, stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm, is that \"it always spills outwards.\" For them it was an amazing feminist experience , but it didn't last . Every single person I spoke to who intentionally embraced a \"slut\" persona ended up being treated terribly by people outside of her circle , because the culture we live in is so dominated by the sexual double standard . But beyond women who tried to reclaim \"slut\" for themselves, other feminists have rightfully asked why we should all try to reclaim a word with so much baggage - especially a word that impacts different women differently, and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice . SlutWalks, for example, are no longer the cause celebre they once were because some women of color spoke out against the ways in which the protests and the reclamation of \"slut\" focused on the ability of white women to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning . A group of black female academics, activists, and writers wrote an open letter explaining that \"as Black women, we do not have the privilege or the space to call ourselves 'slut' without validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what and who the Black woman is.\" Rutgers professor and writer Brittney Cooper wrote at the time,\"To organize a movement around the reclamation of a term is in and of itself an act of white privilege.\" In response, some SlutWalk organizers changed the name of their protests ; today , while a handful of SlutWalks remain , the excitement over the movement has waned noticeably . But women everywhere are still being actively, physically hurt by the stereotypes that lead people to call them \"sluts\" . Just look to the high profile deaths of young women who were slut-shamed and a mass shooting where the killer said he was targeting \"blonde sluts\" : we're still being targeted because of our identities and sexualities , and it has, perhaps appropriately, put a damper on the once-celebratory reclamation of the word . Maybe that the wounds inflicted by \"slut\"- and the culture that encourages people to define women that way - that we once hoped were superficial are just too raw and too deep . Maybe the speed of the internet is too fast for us to control a word with so much potential to damage . There' s a poster on my living room wall by artist Favianna Rodriguez that reads:\"I'm a Slut. I Vote. So Does Everyone I Sleep With. And You're About to be More Fucked Than I Am.\" For me, it captures the brash, in-your-face spirit that the feminist movement I've loved is known for . But in this time of unprecedented feminist power, the conversation about \"slut\" can be more reflective than fevered . Women who want to call themselves \"sluts\" shouldn't stop, or be made to stop - I love that women can embrace that which is meant to hurt them and find power in it . But I also know that we can still claim our sexuality and agency without using a word meant to denigrate- a word that still hurts so many people . Besides , we don't need \"slut\" to tell us what we already know: women have sex , some people don't like that and we're going to continue to do it anyway .",

One has taken his\"It's not Adam & Steve\" commemorative pin badge off and is using it to pierce the condoms . The rest of the coach has just finished playing\"identify the Ayn Rand quote\" , and near the front of the bus the libertarians are swapping pill bottles . \"This is bat country,\" one of them mutters , while another reads a book on the gold standard . After a day's leafleting in North Warwickshire, the team heads to the nearest Holiday Inn where a curry is being prepared . It has taken two days for \"Banter Bus\" to emerge as the name of the team vehicle , edging out Winning Wagon and Chat Coach . \"How to spot a Labour voter\" is the topic of conversation , and it is generally agreed that they are the ones who fly-tip in their own front gardens . Within minutes of the party chairman telling the audience that the most successful campaigners may get to throw shapes with Sam Cam in Ibiza, groups have split off into the corners of the room to form campaign teams . A mixture of Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Taylor Swift is encouraging young attendees to adjust their pocket squares and hit the dance floor . The team encounter a group of Labour supporters who - as Central Office training suggested- broke into tears and fled when shown the standard-issue photograph of Ed Miliband standing in a puddle . Volunteers carry the auto- tuned Nick Clegg apology for similar purposes , but headquarters has yet to devise a Ukip strategy . Later in the afternoon there is a brief tangle with the media as two young men brawl over the correct pronunciation of \"Boadicea\" . Local press are quick to the scene, and get shots of the men before they've been encouraged to remove their rosettes and tie pins . Insiders whisper that it's really an argument about whose dance card was marked last night . \"Oxbridge people get it,\" says one young man as he leans over the table of a group of women enjoying their fourth curry dinner of the trip . This is the first floor restaurant of a Hilton Doubletree, with all the ambience of a young offenders' institution . The women have taken to dining in a protective circle with their handbags on the backs of their chairs, reminiscent of the Roman Legion's \"testudo\" or \"tortoise\" formation . A second man leans in to say,\"Really, most people will agree that it's actually 'Doxbridge'.\" Later that night there are unconfirmed reports that the man who invented the \"Doxbridge\" portmanteau to include his alma mater of Durham has been shivved with a plastic Liam Fox doll and has left the trip . \"We're all in this together,\" one volunteer cheerfully tells the receptionist as the Banter Bus makes an unexpected stop at a sexual health clinic . The volunteers pile off and spend the morning getting tested, only for a red-faced doctor to explain that their symptoms (flatulence, lethargy) are the result of too much curry, and that since only two of them have been sexually active in the past month, this has been a complete waste of NHS time and money . \"We love the NHS,\" a group leader protests , as the others try very hard to look like they're one of the two . For the rest of the day everything is described as \"sound\" , and after six hours of delivering leaflets in the rain, the team opt for KFC and vodka shots . The team are cold . Not only was the heating broken in the village hall they slept in last night, but the windows of the bus have all had to be kept open . The driver has pointed to a European directive safeguarding his working conditions , which has forced the team to crack the sunroof . By lunchtime, the cold and the EU directive has unified two groups who previously had not shared three words with each other , as the socially conservative volunteers and the libertarians demand the coach be stopped outside a Ukip field headquarters for them to defect . As one of the libertarians mutters \"sound\" at the sight of the Ukip flag, a Team 2015 staffer screams,\" You can't say that, that's our word\", and has a cry . In a recount of the votes minus the defectors, the vehicle has reverted to Chat Coach , and the group are arguing whether David Davis or Theresa May would survive longest on a desert island before someone lets slip that they know how to buy Twitter followers . Within a few minutes the group are all upping their social media presence . That evening the Chat Coach stops for the final time , and the revellers enjoy an Ibiza-themed beer and curry night followed by Ibiza-themed laser quest . One volunteer overhears Samantha Cameron's assistant screaming at Shapps over the phone, stating in no uncertain terms that Samantha would rather be trapped in a steam room with the two Eds than go on holiday with Team 2015, and that he could stick his competition . The volunteer tweets excitedly to his 30,000 followers , only to remember that none of them are real . What happens on tour really does stay on tour .",

            "input": "#YouTubeAsksObama: GOP desperately needs a 'Glozell' moment. Republicans who mock President Obama's interviews with the three popular YouTube Internet stars make a serious mistake . While the Obama White House is completely incompetent and weak , they know how to spin everyday Americans . The Washington media crowd, including conservative media, preaches to the choir of news junkies . The idea that you can win a modern presidential election without being modern is what should be mocked . How can it be that some Republicans still don't understand that young people aren't watching\"Meet the Press\" or \"Fox News Sunday\"? In fact ,  news junkies are watching less\"Meet the Press.\" Young people are getting their news from YouTube, Facebook and Ellen . And Team Obama has largely monopolized the playgrounds where Millennials are hanging out . The YouTube interviews inside the White House were an easy home run for the president's communications team . The White House must love the ridiculing they are getting from conservatives, too . The more out of touch Republicans seem, the easier their job to spin young people becomes . The Internet stars who interviewed Obama have a combined reach of thirteen million people - and most of them aren't following politics . They are 'gettable' and Democrats are reaching them . Republicans need to change their elitist attitudes -- and fast . Voters aren't as informed as we want them to be and the Democrats have figured out how to reach them with simple messages . I am not sure how anyone could criticize the president's outreach to thirteen million people . After all ,  one YouTube host informed the president that during the State of the Union address, the most Googled question in America was\"How old is Obama?\" Hank Green, a wildly successful vlogger with his brother, who regularly reaches 2.4 million people through their YouTube videos, started off the round-robin interviews by thanking the president for welcoming him to his house . Obama, showing incredible connectivity with his audience responded with an analogy that every young person understands . \"I'm actually leasing (this house), and my lease runs out in two years. I hope to get my security deposit back,\" said Obama . Green, who was born in 1980, focused his questions on what young, non-news junkies are thinking about their government . Green asked whether something can \"really get done in Washington,\" how drone strikes make sense and whether or not more sanctions can work on a country like North Korea . His questioning was serious . Green also asked one of the smartest questions Obama has had over the last six years . Green told the president,\"I don't smoke pot... I think it's bad for my brain... but I'm for legalization.... how do we move forward out of this legal gray-ness?\" It was a way of forming a question many in the White House press corps have never thought about . Green finished the interview by sharing with Obama a receipt for a prescription drug medication that he said cost $1,100 but because he enrolled in ObamaCare now costs $5 . The moment was a strong message for the millions watching . The president didn't miss the moment either and said of ObamaCare,\"We had some bad hiccups initially... but the website works really well now.\" Glozell Simon, a 52-year-old comedian who goes by the name Glozell Green and reaches 3 million people, was up next . Glozell surprised the Washington crowd by first asking,\"Why didn't the government help Sony feel protected and safe enough to release the film on time?\" She went on to tell the president she cut off the hoodies from her husband's sweatshirts because of her concern for his safety , and then asked a question about Cuba because many of her Cuban friends have concerns over Obama's new friendship with Castro . Glozell, who although is wildly creative and funny, was completely respectful of the situation . She asked about same sex marriage and Obama's legacy and gave her followers a peek at the president answering easy, soft questions . The president looked and sounded relatable . Bethany Mota, a 19-year-old YouTube star who regularly reaches eight million people was the last interviewer . Mota also asked informal but serious questions on education, cyber-bullying, Boko Haram and China . Obama told her,\"your voice is more powerful than the president of the United States.\" And I am sure her young female followers agreed . Mota, too, asked the president a question in a way traditional reporters have failed to ask . \"I was just in China and couldn't access the apps and websites I could back home,\" Mota said . Obama gave her a non-answer that made him look knowledgeable but likeable . She also said,\"I never really followed politics that much... why should the younger generation be interested in politics?\" The president again spun a good tale about the need for young people to get involved so they can go to college . Eight million young women now think Obama wants them to go to college . It was a brilliant move by the president . Obama finished the round of interviews by taking a selfie with the three and adding this eye-opening insight into his reason for going around the White House press corps and sitting down with YouTube stars . Obama told them:\"This is the power of what the Internet is all about... you can create content and there' s not all these barriers to entry... suddenly you get millions of people who are listening to you.\" Republicans are bound to lose the next presidential election again if they can't communicate with new voters . Millions of people walk into the voting booth and vote for someone they like . News junkies and Washington types casually refer to this as\"Who would you want to have a beer with?\" The sentiment is accurate but the analogy should be updated to\"Who do you want to make a YouTube video with?\" I think President Obama is weak, bored with the office, and an incompetent leader . But he sure knows how to go around the White House press corps .",

            "input": "Zero suicides is an admirable aim but it requires all-out change. On Monday, Nick Clegg pledged to sign up the NHS to a national \"zero suicide\" campaign . This comes in a week when I have spent a lot of time talking to the media about depression in an attempt to get people to support Calm and the other charities that are doing incredible work to help people coping with mental illness . I have appeared on national radio, in the press and on television to talk about my story , but the more coverage I get, the more I ask: why me? Let me make this clear . I am not famous , I am not trying to be famous . I am a normal lad who made mistakes, lived a lie, and eventually attempted to take my own life . I am just another statistic . Someone who suffered from an illness that took over my life and made me a person I didn't recognise . There is absolutely nothing special or unique about me . Yet I am getting calls from people asking me to share my story . The fact that I am newsworthy, simply because I have spoken openly about the demons I was facing, makes me think that we are being greatly let down by society . Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged 20-49 in the UK . It's a statistic that, no matter how many times I say it, continues to shock me to the core . Yet it's something that few people seem to be talking about openly, if at all . I get it, we're British . Sometimes we don't like talking about things that make us uncomfortable . Sometimes we'd rather not ask the question because we can't handle the answer . But that simply cannot continue . It's time that people are made to stand up and face the harsh reality . The fear of being judged is preventing people from talking about their secret turmoil . There is very little being done by the people who have the biggest influence to remove those fears, remove the stigmas, to get people talking about mental health, and make people comfortable with the subject . The media doesn't just have influence, it has a responsibility to help communicate a message and set an agenda . Yes, things are changing , but it can't be right that the furthest we've come is having someone receive live therapy on air with Phillip Schofield or a soap character crashing a minibus . There is too much box-ticking going on . A petition signed, a campaign joined, an empty promise in an election year . All very good but what do they actually do? Do they help save enough lives? The system needs changing from top to bottom . There is no consistency or urgency, despite the high rate of men dying from suicide . What bigger wake-up call do you need? I would ask David Cameron to speak up and tell us what he is going to do . To meet me, to let me introduce him to the small team at Calm, the volunteers, the campaigners, the people on the end of phones with someone's life in their hands . Let me show him people who feel as if they have nowhere to turn . Let me show him the lack of knowledge of some people working in GP surgeries, and the pressure that those who make a positive difference are working under, as rates of mental illness increase continually . Let me show how so little can make such a big difference . If Nick Clegg is serious about mental health then he needs to show it . It's great that he has decided that we need to aim for zero suicides but I wonder, what was the aim before this? Just a few suicides? A hundred? Shouldn't the aim always have been zero? The likes of Calm, Mind, The Samaritans and everyone else, are doing incredible work but it shouldn't be left to them to do it all alone . They can only work with the limited resources they have . They need supporting and backing . We need to put faces and voices to genuine experiences . Speaking out about dealing with depression shouldn't be considered a \"brave\" act ; it shouldn't be an extraordinary or unusual story to read . It should be common . It should be accepted . It should be normal . But while we live in a society that doesn't know how to deal with it, and perhaps does not want to deal with it, we cannot expect people to talk openly about such private matters . Much focus is placed on those who are suffering , and rightly so , but in order to truly help them, we need to make everyone else comfortable and knowledgeable enough to know what to do, how to act, and know how to signpost people to the help that is out there . We need to be talking about mental illness in schools . We need to make in-depth training compulsory in the workplace . We need to be training taxi drivers, bar staff, hairdressers - people who will find out more about a person through a casual conversation than their friends will ever know . We need to normalise talking about the realities of depression, to normalise conversations about the very real prospect of suicide - it is the only way we can move forward together . We need a radical change from top to bottom . Therapy isn't just about lying on a couch while someone writes down your childhood memories . It's about feeling comfortable enough to say you're not OK .",
