    ],
    "Definition": "In this task, you will be given a debate topic, along with a sentence from the debate. You should classify the given sentence and choose the type of that sentence. Possible types are explained below.\nPolicy: This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like \"should\" and \"ought to\". It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred.\nValue: This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence.\nFact: This refers to an objective proposition expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.\nTestimony: This refers to an objective sentence about the author's personal state or experience. Evidence for Testimony is not publicly available in most cases.\nReference: This refers to a reference to a source of objective evidence. It is typically a citation or a URL of a published work from a renowned source.",

            "output": "Policy",
            "explanation": "Although the policy statement in the sentence is somehow indirect, the best answer for it is policy, since it suggests there're several reasons why there should be a certain policy (the phrase \"there are other reasons why we would want to make it harder.)\""
