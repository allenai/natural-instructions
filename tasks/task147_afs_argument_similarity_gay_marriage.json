    "Definition": "We would like you to classify each of the following sets of argument pairs (discussing Gay Marriage) basedon your perception of how SIMILAR the arguments are, on the scale from 1 to 5, examples follow. (5) Completely equivalent, mean pretty much exactly thesame thing, using different words.  (4) Mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ.One argument may be more specific than another or includea relatively unimportant extra fact. (3) Roughly equivalent, but some important informationdiffers or is missing. This includes cases where the argument is about the same FACET but the authors have different stances on that facet. (2) Not equivalent, but share some details. For example,talking about the same entities but making different arguments (different facets). (1) Not equivalent.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sent1: Many social conservatives argue that benefits are provided to married couples because, in turn, married couples benefit society. \n Sent2: We give married couples marriage benefits TO STRENGTHEN the marriage, because marriage STRENGTHENS society.",

            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "The first argument says gay marriages are well defined, and the second says a gay couple by definition are not entitled to these benefits."

            "input": "Sent1: So I must ask you why exactly are you against same sex marriage when it has been shown that the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial couples getting married? \n Sent2: I can only assume because you don't want to admit that perversion of marriage will rise out of same gender marriage.",
            "output": "5",
            "explanation": "The answer should be 1 instead since the first argument supports gay marriage by saying the ban on gay marriage is the same as the ban on interracial marriage, while the second argument rejects gay marriage by claiming perversion will rise out of same gender marriage."
