    "Definition": "We would like you to classify each of the following sets of argument pairs (discussing Gay Marriage)  into either SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR. A pair of arguments is considered SIMILAR if the arguments are about the same FACET (making the same argument), and is considered NOT SIMILAR if they do not have the same FACET. A FACET is a low level issue that often reoccurs in many arguments in support of the author's stance or in attacking the other author's position.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Sent1: Many social conservatives argue that benefits are provided to married couples because, in turn, married couples benefit society. \n Sent2: We give married couples marriage benefits TO STRENGTHEN the marriage, because marriage STRENGTHENS society.",
            "output": "Similar",
            "explanation": "Both arguments argue that married couples can benefit the society."
        },

            "input": "Sent1: A civil partnership between two homosexual men or two lesbian women should be called a homosexual civil partnership. \n Sent2: Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.",
            "output": "Not similar",
            "explanation": "The first argument says gay marriages are well defined, and the second says a gay couple by definition are not entitled to these benefits."

            "input": "Sent1: So I must ask you why exactly are you against same sex marriage when it has been shown that the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial couples getting married? \n Sent2: I can only assume because you don't want to admit that perversion of marriage will rise out of same gender marriage.",
            "output": "Similar",
            "explanation": "The answer should be Not similar instead since the first argument supports gay marriage by saying the ban on gay marriage is the same as the ban on interracial marriage, while the second argument rejects gay marriage by claiming perversion will rise out of same gender marriage."
