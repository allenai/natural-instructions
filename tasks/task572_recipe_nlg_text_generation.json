Continue to actively stir the dough over the heat (\"Dessecher\") until it forms a ball that easily pulls away from the side of the pot - approximately two to three minutes.,Chef's Note: When adding the dry ingredients, stir aggressively - the dough should form quickly. Cooking the dough mixture for a couple of minutes causes the starches in the Bread Flour to gelatinize and also dries the dough.,Transfer the dough to a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat the dough on medium speed for several minutes, releasing heat and steam. While the dough cools, beat the Eggs and Egg Yolks together in a separate bowl and set aside.,Once the dough is no longer hot, add the Eggs in no fewer than six additions. After each addition, mix the dough until the Egg is completely incorporated. When all of the Eggs have been added, the dough should be slightly fluid (i.e. when a trench is drawn through the center of the dough, it should fill back in within a couple of seconds).,Chef's Note: It is important that the dough cools slightly before the Eggs are added or else the Eggs will cook. However, if the dough is too cold, the Eggs will not mix in well.,Form and bake the Pate a Choux according to the specific recipe.

Whisk in the brown sugar, cornmeal, and kosher salt.,______,Slowly pour the egg mixture into the maple mixture and whisk just until combined.,Place the blind-baked shell on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the crimped edge with the beaten egg. Pour the maple filling into the pie shell until it reaches the bottom of the crimps.,Transfer the baking sheet with the pie on it to the oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed and the center jiggles only slightly when shaken. It will continue to set as it cools.,Remove the baking sheet from the oven and transfer the pie to a wire rack to cool for 4 to 6 hours. Once fully cooled and at room temperature, sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt, slice into 6 to 8 pieces, and serve.,Store leftover pie, well wrapped in plastic wrap or under a pie dome, at room temperature for up to 3 days.,In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt and stir to mix well. Place the sticks of butter in the bowl and coat on all sides with the flour mixture. Using a bench scraper, cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Work quickly to separate the cubes with your hands until they are all lightly coated in flour. Grab that bench scraper once again and cut each cube in half. I always tell my pie dough students that it's unnecessary to actually cut each cube perfectly in half, but it's a good idea to break up the butter enough so that you can be super-efficient when it's pastry blender time.,It's pastry blender time! Switch to the pastry blender and begin to cut in the butter with one hand while turning the bowl with the other. It's important not to aim for the same spot at the bottom of the bowl with each stroke of the pastry blender, but to actually slice through butter every time to maximize efficiency. When the pastry blender clogs up, carefully clean it out with your fingers (watch out, it bites!) or a butter knife and use your hands to toss the ingredients a bit. Continue to blend and turn until the largest pieces are the size and shape of peas and the rest of the mixture feels and looks freakishly similar to canned Parmesan cheese.,At this point, add the water-vinegar mixture all at once, and switch back to the bench scraper. Scrape as much of the mixture as you can from one side of the bowl to the other, until you can't see visible pools of liquid anymore. Now it's hand time. Scoop up as much of the mixture as you can, and use the tips of your fingers (and a whole lot of pressure) to press it back down onto the rest of the ingredients. Rotate the bowl a quarter-turn and repeat. Scoop, press, and turn. With each fold, your intention is to be quickly forming the mixture into one cohesive mass. Remember to incorporate any dry, floury bits that have congregated at the bottom of the bowl, and once those are completely gone and the dough is formed, it's time to stop.,Remove the dough from the bowl, place it on a lightly floured counter, and use your bench scraper to divide it into two equal pieces. Gently pat each into a 2-inch-thick disc, working quickly to seal any broken edges before wrapping them tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap. If you're portioning for a lattice-topped pie, shape one half into a 2-inch-thick disc and the other half into a 6 by 3-inch rectangle. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or, ideally, overnight. When you go to roll out the crust, you want the discs to feel as hard and cold as the butter did when you removed it from the fridge to make the dough. This will make the roll-out way easier.,You can keep the pie dough in the fridge for a few days or in the freezer for up to 1 year. If frozen, remove the dough and place it in the refrigerator to thaw one full day before you intend to use it. If you're planning to make only one single-crust pie, wrap the discs separately and place one in the freezer.,NOTE: Icy water, now improved and with tang: While working at Brooklyn's Four & Twenty Blackbirds for a summer, I learned a number of good tricks that considerably changed my pie dough-making experience. Here's one of my favorites: Fill a 1-cup liquid measuring cup with about 1 inch of water and freeze until completely frozen. Just after you mix your dry ingredients, grab it from the freezer and fill with water plus 2 tablespoons or so of apple cider vinegar. The ice-cold water-vinegar mixture should look just like apple juice. Let it chill on your counter while you mix the other ingredients for the dough.,NOTE 2: The addition of vinegar to pie dough was originally thought to tenderize the gluten (thus avoiding a tough crust), but there isn't any good scientific evidence proving that it makes a difference. We keep it in our recipe for its tangy flavor and our respect for tradition.,NOTE 3: Not the pie-baking plan-ahead type? That's okay! When you're ready to make the dough, simply fill a 1-cup liquid measuring cup about halfway with ice, then add water and 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar.",

And pare down the smoked ham hock--don't worry if it isn't in small pieces, you are mainly using this for the smoke flavor.,Next, toss the meat in the olive oil with the spices and herbs. Set everything into a roasting tray in a single-layer. And add the chicken stock until it is about half-way up the side of the pork.,Cook the pork for 30minutes at 500degrees, then reduce the temperature to 275degrees for the final 2 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes. It is ready when the pork pulls apart easily. Remove from oven.,Allow the pork to cool in the cooking liquid until it isn't too hot to be shredded easily by hand. Strain the liquid from the pork and reserve the liquid--add a splash of cider vinegar to taste, which will help to cut through the richness and bolster the southern take on rillette.,Pick out the peppercorns, bay leaves and garlic cloves. You can mash one of the garlic cloves into the pork if you want a nice garlic undertone.,Shred the pork a moderate amount, so that you have a nice blend of hunks and strings. Here is where you can decide if you want to keep any of the ham hock. The meat will boost the meaty flavor, but it is not to everyone's taste.,______,Place in fridge and allow to set for at least 4-hours, but preferably at least 3-days. It gives time for the jus to infuse. The jar method with a fat cap will keep nicely for up to 3-months, and the log should be used within a week or two.,As for accompaniments, I like to go with traditional charcuterie accompaniments--a nice mustard, a few seasonings, a roasted garlic clove and some pickles. Serve with crusty bread and indulge. Dusting the rillette with smoked paprika or regular sweet- or hot- paprika is a nice accompaniment as well.",
            "output": [
                "Next choose your preferred style. You can either set the rillette in a ball jar and pour enough of the reserved juice to cover and preserve the rillette, which will grow in flavor as it ages. Or you can roll the rillette in plastic wrap for a \"head cheese\" approach and a more pleasant presentation. If rolling into a log, drizzle enough of the reserved jus and rendered pork fat over the meat to moisten and bind."

Crumble it by hand or in a blender or with a knife. Cut up the portobello mushrooms and the 2 shallots fairly small. Fry them in butter over a medium-low heat for a few minutes, then throw in the parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Simon & Garfunkel herbs). Once the shallots are softened, dump in the breadcrumbs. Stir everything well to get all the flavours mixed up in the bread and fry for another 3-4 minutes.,Transfer the stuffing mixture into a bowl and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Take the sausages and slice down their length with a knife and remove the insides and discard the casings. Add the sausage meat to the warm stuffing and mix it together with a fork.,Heart: Take the heart out of the salt water and rinse it once more. Pat the whole thing dry and grind salt and pepper over it. Rub it in with olive oil, getting both the inside and outside of the heart. Pack in the stuffing filling all cavities of the heart. When it is full, force it closed and tie it up with butcher's string. Use plenty and make sure it's good and tight to prevent stuffing erupting out of any available opening.,______,While the heart is cooking, chunk up some vegetables (whatever you like, but onion, carrot, and celery are good) and scatter them in a baking tray. Lift the heart out of the pan and onto the vegetables. While the pan is still hot, add a little red wine to deglaze. Pour that over the heart, and add some more wine to the base of the tray to keep the vegetables from getting too dry.,Put the tray into the oven and cook for 30 minutes per half kilo of heart (most hearts are about a kilo, so about an hour cook time). Every 20-30 minutes, scoop the juices from the bottom of the tray and pour them back over the meat to keep it from drying. When it is done cooking, take it all out and pour the juices into a saucepan. Cover the meat in foil and leave it somewhere warm for at least 10 minutes. Simmer the juices and add whatever is left of your glass of wine.

The yield should be about 2.5 cups.,A NOTE ON GINGER: I used mature ginger, which imparts a much stronger flavor than young. As well, some juicers juice more efficiently than others. Admittedly, mine is a little long in the tooth. Yours might be more of a Ferrari and yield a higher amount of juice. The reason I am adding this note is because too much ginger can ruin a batch of anything, including this granita, and this is a mercurial ingredient whose use must be metered from rhizome to rhizome. I have found that about 4 tablespoons is a balanced amount for this amount of carrot juice. And remember that as the juice sits, the ginger will 'bloom', and grow stronger, so add with prudence. My advice on how to maneuver is as follows:,Juice a 2 oz. knob of fresh ginger. This should yield 4 tablespoons of ginger juice. Stir the ginger juice into the carrot juice to amalgamate the flavors, and taste. You might like yours a little spicier, so adjust the spice by juicing small knobs, and adding 1 teaspoon at a time to the juicer if you want it spicier. Using prudence with your additions ensures a successfully balanced granita.,Whisk the spices and honey into the ginger-carrot juice until fully incorporated.,Strain this mixture into a 9 x 13\" cake pan, like the one pictured below using a fine mesh strainer lined with a double thickness of cheesecloth. (The inside of my cake pan measures 8.5\" x 12.5\").,Pop the pan into the freezer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 45 minutes, start to scrape and stir the spiced juice with a fork. Be sure to get into the corners of the pan, and squish any solidified chunks with the back of the fork. They should still be quite tender and not difficult to break up at this early stage.,Do this every 20 minutes, being sure to stir vigorously and break up any chunks. You want the texture to be fine and light and the ice crystals small and 'crisp' rather than chunky and icy. Mine froze to the right texture after 1 hour and 45 min.,______",

My foster daughter, now my own through adoption, . . . ALWAYS came home infested. After much research, I discovered Tea Tree Oil. That was 6 years ago. . . . but she also is always immune to any outbreaks at school as well. The tea tree oil (TTO) kills the Louse Central Nervous System (CNS) so they cannot move around and reproduce. Of course, they also die because they cannot feed. Tea tree oil also acts as a repellent because Lice cannot stand it. Therefore, if your child has lice: Apply freely to the scalp and around ears and neck, wherever lice are prominant. Soak the hair in TTO and cover with a cap and sleep on it. Put a towel down on the pillowcase or around their area bcz the oil will stain. As a preventative, we add just a few drops to her shampoo to repel and discourage those nasty little blood suckers. I swear by this and I feel the need to share anytime I can. I struggled SO much, was overcome with frustration and at my wits and when I discovered this. TTO can be found in WALMART vitamin/mineral aisle or at any health food store. Please pass this on as I'm sure you know someone who could use this info. Kate.",

Fold the cherries into the dough. Hopefully they're nice and juicy, so they will bleed into the dough a little bit, which is just fine.,7.

Meaning, a long rectangle that is the same length high as it is deep.,8. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each half in half again (to ensure even cutting of the rectangle - you are cutting it into quarters). You'll be left with 4 squares once you flip each 'slice' onto its side. Cut these squares in half on the diagonal to wind up with 8 triangular scones.,9. Place the scones on an ungreased cookie sheet and brush the tops with a little heavy cream.,10.

Mix the milk and confectioners' sugar together in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the butter and white chocolate chips (no need to stir). Nuke it in the microwave for 30 seconds on high.,2. Whisk the glaze to incorporate the white chocolate and smooth out any lumps.

Pour the salad dressing over the top, and mix to coat.,Let the salad sit in the dressing for at least five minutes to allow the bread to soak up some of the dressing.,Serve in a nice serving dish and dig in. The result is a salad that blew my wife away. She was startled by the flavors the mint dressing exposed. It looks like a standard dinner salad, but it isn't. It is actually better and offers a tart and minty flavor that has you coming back for more. And to me, that's not a bad thing. Hope you enjoy.",

Serving a pone warm is fine too, but it may not slice as easily as it does once it has cooled.,You will also need:,1. A large mixing bowl and hand mixer or a standing mixer and bowl.,2. A casserole or baking dish. The one used for the pictured pone is a 10-inch round Pyrex one (2-inches deep), but any size casserole will be fine. Pones aren't finicky-the baking time will not vary substantially, even if a smaller casserole is used.,For the pone:,1. Butter the baking dish or casserole. Preheat the oven to 325 F.,______,3. Pour in the beaten eggs and mix them in well.,4. Add the sweet potato puree, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, salt and molasses and mix everything together well.,5. Pour the batter into the baking dish or casserole and bake it for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Baking times will vary a little, depending on the size of the baking dish. The pone is done when it no longer jiggles in the pan as though there is wet batter beneath its surface. It will be solid and look done.,A serving suggestion: This pone may be served alongside the main course of a Thanksgiving dinner. A pone slices better once it has cooled. It may be made a day in advance, cooled completely, covered, and refrigerated overnight. Bring it to room temperature before slicing and serving. Just like cranberry sauce, pone doesn't have to be eaten warm.",

Stir together the corn syrup, grenadine, and food colorings (we do it right in the measuring cup to save dish washing--every erg saved in preparation is an erg one can use to enjoy the Payoff).,For the bladder (the bag that keeps the blood together inside the mass of gelatin) take the gallon-size food-storage bag and turn it inside out.,Pour the blood mixture into one corner of the bag and twist it closed so that no air bubble is caught between the sauce and the twist.,Tie a knot in the twisted plastic.,Adjust the position of the knot so that when the bag lies on the counter, it's about 1 1/2 to 2 inches high, and tighten the knot.

Twist the knife slightly, and blood will start to ooze out.,Bare your teeth like a Marine jabbing with bayonet, and widen the wound. When the blood is coming at a good slip, grab a dessert plate, and cut a slice from one of the lobes of the heart.

Bake for 7 minutes. Allow to cool while preparing the crust.,Raise the oven temp to 425째F, and move your oven racks so you can bake on the lowest rack. Prep your pizza stone or baking sheet by dusting it lightly with flour (you may need to also grease a baking pan or use parchment paper to prevent sticking). .,Divide the pizza dough into 8 equal sections and roll each into a ball (dusting your hands and the dough, with flour, as needed).

I did 1-3 clouds per pizza, slightly overlapping a few of them.,Use either the nori to cut the eyes and smile out for each cloud. To make it easier, you can draw the designs onto parchment paper, and cut them out to use as a template for the nori. Repeat this process to cut the Pi symbol out of the nori as well (making a template here is much easier as you can also size the shape to fit your pizzas and clouds). *A helpful tip is to fold the nori sheet a few times before cutting to save you time and make sure the eyes match.,Place the faces onto the clouds (a toothpick dipped into a little water helps with this), give them each a Pi symbol to hold, place the clouds on top of your pizzas, and now you're ready to celebrate Pi Day!",

(I used my food processor, but I didn't always have one and have had great results making this crust by hand.) Please note that this is basically a double pie, meaning it is a lot of dough! I did mine in two batches-that is, I divided the recipe in half and repeated the process twice. If you have a giant mixing bowl or food processor, go for it, but my equipment isn't large enough to handle 7 1/2 cups of flour.,Add in the chopped pieces of cold butter and cold shortening. Blend together with your hands or pulse with your processor until you have coarse crumbs (it doesn't have to be perfect). You can use a pastry cutter, too, but I find that a clean pair of hands work best. Mix together the water and vinegar in a small bowl. When ready, slowly drizzle it over the dough, a tablespoon or so at a time, gently stirring the mixture with a fork or pulsing with your processor, until fully incorporated (you may not use all of the liquid).,It might seem a bit too wet at this point, but it will dry up while it sits in the fridge. Form the dough gently into 2 loose balls, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight (as always, overnight is best). Make your filling when you are almost ready to use your dough.,______,Meanwhile, place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Start whipping the egg whites to soft peaks on medium speed. You want to have the egg whites whipped and ready to go, waiting for your syrup to be drizzled in. If they're whipping faster than your syrup is coming to temperature, just stop the mixer until the syrup is ready, which is what I did.,When the syrup reaches 240째 F, reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly drizzle about 2 tablespoons of syrup into the egg whites to warm them. If you add too much syrup at once, the whites will scramble. Slowly drizzle in the rest of the syrup, a bit at a time-seriously, do not do more than 2 tablespoons at a time.,Increase the speed to medium high and whip until the marshmallow fluff is stiff and glossy, about 7 solid minutes. Don't try to speed this process up! Add in the vanilla and whip 2 minutes more. Use the fluff immediately or refrigerate stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. (I made my fluff about 4 hours ahead of time before baking with it, and I actually doubled the recipe so that I'd have some extra to spread of the top of the pie pieces... just an idea!),For the chocolate filling: If you have a double boiler, use that. I don't, so I just melt chocolate very slowly and carefully because it burns easily. In a saucepan, combine your cocoa powder, heavy cream, chocolate, sugar, butter, and salt. Stir constantly medium-low heat constantly until everything is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. The mixture will thicken up as it cools down, making it easy to spread over your pie crust later.,For assembly: Remove your crust from the refrigerator to allow for easier rolling. Preheat your oven to 400째 F. Generously butter a half-sheet pan. Roll out your first ball of dough-it should be about an inch or two longer and wider than the baking sheet, but it does not have to be perfect by any means. If you need to re-roll a few scraps here and there to patch up pieces, that's fine. Move it over onto the baking sheet by draping it over the rolling pin. Unfold it and gently press the pie crust into the bottom of the baking sheet.,Spread your chocolate mixture over the dough, then scatter mini marshmallows over top, saving some for a finishing touch once the pie is baked. Sprinkle 4 crushed graham crackers over the top of the marshmallow. Roll out your second pie crust and gently place it over the top. Crimp the edges together, discarding any scraps (or using them to decorate the pie, dealer's choice). Pull the dough slightly inward, away from the edges of the baking sheet, to make it easier to cut later.,Use a fork to make a pattern in the top of the pie, like a traditional Pop-Tart. Beat together your egg and water and brush the top of the pie with it. Place the pie in the oven, then reduce the heat to 375째 F. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until golden brown and shiny on top. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.,Spread the marshmallow fluff all over the top of the pie and decorate with any leftover mini marshmallows. Use a kitchen torch to brulee your topping, then slice, serve, and enjoy!",

                "For the marshmallow fluff: Stir together the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often, until the it reaches 240째 F on a candy/fat thermometer. Be careful not to let the mixture bubble over-turn the heat down if you need to and keep a watchful eye over it. This might take a little longer than you think, but just keep at it. Mine took about 10 minutes, but when you're standing there watching it, it feels like an eternity. It got stuck at around 220째 for what seemed like forever, but then it eventually got up to 240째."
