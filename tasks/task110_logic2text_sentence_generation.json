        "In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table. Your job is to generate a natural language interpretation of the given command. \n Here are the definitions of logical operators: \n 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view \n 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view \n 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row \n 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments \n 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column \n 6. nth max/nth min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column \n 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column \n 8. nth argmax/nth argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column \n 9. eq/not eq: returns if the two arguments are equal \n 10. round eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance \n 11. greater/less: returns if argument 1 is greater/less than argument 2 \n 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments \n 13. filter eq/not eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to argument 3 \n 14. filter greater/less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than argument 3 \n 15. filter greater eq /less eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than argument 3 \n 16. filter all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table \n 17. all eq/not eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to argument 3 \n 18. all greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than argument 3 \n 19. all greater eq/less eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to argument 3 \n 20. most eq/not eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to argument 3 \n 21. most greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than argument 3 \n 22. most greater eq/less eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to argument 3"
