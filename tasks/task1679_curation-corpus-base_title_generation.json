The state has slashed payments to dental care providers and hygienists and created a cumbersome preauthorization process which is hindering the delivery of dental care as part of Denti-Cal. Denti-Cal, the publicly funded program for the poor, reduced the rate for a simple cleaning procedure from $130 to $55 which has seen hygienists unable to continue treating their patients. The Department of Health Care Services maintains it made the changes to reduce unnecessary treatment, but the hygienists maintain that the new regulations victimize the most vulnerable patients. Whilst dental hygienists are allowed to practice without direct supervision in 40 states, rules governing patient choice, reimbursement and preauthorization rates vary. Since reducing payments for maintenance cleaning, many hygienists have stopped seeing their patients, and a lawsuit was filed, arguing that the decision was made without obtaining federal approval. At the same time as the reductions, requirements were also imposed for x-rays but this is an especially difficult process when working with disabled and elderly patients, should the requests even be granted. State data indicates a disparity between hygienists\u2019 observations and state approval, which suggests that between July 2016 to July 2017, 10,000 of almost 13,000 requests were granted for deep cleaning, paying $2.5 million in the process. These figures are disputed by hygienists, one of whom claims that she lost 70 percent of her Denti-Cal patients because of the changes. This is the first time in 20 years, since dental hygienists were permitted to act independently that preauthorization has been required.\n",

Not only does this lead to general suffering, from an economic stance work productivity is damaged across all age ranges. Moreover, high medical costs mean only 1 in 3 dentists actually accept Medicaid patients. However, states are now attempting to overcome the issues that stop both adults and children receiving proper dental care at little cost to the taxpayer. Political advocates Grover Norquist and Don Berwick see a simple solution, one that received over a 75 percent backing from Democrats and Republicans alike. They want to allow dentists to hire a variety of professionals from dental therapists to nurse practitioners who can supply preventive care and perform routine procedures that do not require dentists. This would utilize the free market at little cost, allowing dental therapists to operate without unnecessary government barriers while being able to treat more patients, offering the potential opportunity for SME\u2019s expansion. Tragic cases like Deamonte Driver, who lost his life after receiving poor dental treatment would be prevented if dental therapists were able to operate. Subsequently, dental therapists are far cheaper than dentists, they provide high-quality care, are well educated and readily available, having existed in more than 50 countries for over a century. Should states turn to dental therapists, it would provide a simple solution to help patients, businesses and combat rising health care costs.\n",

It is likely that the states will attempt to implement a model similar to that of RomneyCare, introduced in Massachusetts in 2006, and the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. These states do not require federal approval for the move as the mandate penalty is a tax, and as a result, have the ability to implement their own version of the Obamacare mandate.

Those who live in assisted living facilities are usually transported to emergency departments as a matter of policy, even if the falls are not serious, putting unnecessary strain on health services and increasing the exposure of patients to risks such as unnecessary tests or infections. The Wake County Emergency Medical Services worked alongside the Doctors Making Housecalls service to create a protocol for specifically-trained paramedics to identify which patients required emergency transport and which could be provided with primary care provider assessment within 18 hours of the call to the emergency medical services. The study took into account 953 residents, with the group having 359 residents that suffered 840 ground-level falls over a 43-month period. The protocol found that transport was unnecessary after 553 falls, a 62.9 percent decrease in the usual level of transports.

The House bill has proposed removing this deduction entirely, whereas the Senate bill plans to leave medical expense deductions untouched. If the House bill is successful, those who spent more money on health expenses this year stand to lose more money in 2018. The AARP Public Policy Institute has evaluated IRS data from 2015 and calculated that 8.8 million Americans use the deduction annually, including the elderly, those with children with special needs, and the disabled. Around 55 percent of those claiming the deduction were over the age of 65, with 69 percent having incomes under $75,000. The average sum claimed was $9,904. Around 52 percent of those who are older than 65 will require extended care before they die, federal data has found, making the deduction important for many Americans requiring assistance. The Republicans in Congress could use the eradication of the deduction to penalize states with higher income taxes by reducing the deductibles that are permitted.

These cuts would endanger the half of Medicare beneficiaries who earn less than $23,500, and the seniors that depend on Medicare programs for assistance. There is strong bipartisan support for repeal of the IPAB, with one bill already passed in the house calling for immediate repeal and further legislation pending in the Senate. Indeed, one vote has already been passed to deny any funds to establishing the IPAB.

Often it is the cost of treatments that are the cause of a lack of dental care amongst seniors, with the most commonly needed dental treatments not covered by Medicare. A 2016 Medicare survey revealed that 75 percent of costs are paid out of pocket by Medicare beneficiaries, with only 12 percent of employer-based plans and 4 percent of Medicare Advantage plans covering the costs. To make matters worse, dental procedure costs rise as an individual ages and half of the Medicare survey respondents replied that a strained budget was their main reason for failing to see a dental professional. Suggestions for insurance coverage range from supplementary coverage to existing dental plans, to stand alone policies or looking to Medicare Advantage plans when patients turn 65. A 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation report revealed that 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had edentulism, a total loss of natural teeth, and demonstrates that alternatives to Medicare coverage must be sought after.

There are significant advantages to performing medical visits at home, particularly amongst Medicare beneficiaries. Half of Medicare spending is taken up by only 5 percent of the Medicare population, whilst 1 percent of beneficiaries account for 23 percent of total costs. These patients often suffer from a range of chronic conditions and performing primary care at home both removes the stress of a hospital visit without shouldering the costs involved as well. In addition, primary care at home also supports preventative treatment plans. The HCCI has received a multimillion-dollar grant to offer home-based primary care training and its CEO, Dr. Thomas Cornwell, hopes the practice will eventually become a Medicare benefit, rather than a one-off treatment. Currently, the Independence at Home Demonstration from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is testing the use of primary care for seniors at home to evaluate the benefits for patients with multiple chronic conditions.\n",
