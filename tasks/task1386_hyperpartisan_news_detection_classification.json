At moments of crisis in our nation, in addition to\ninvoking the assistance of Higher powers, we can call upon the Constitution\nfor guidance. Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution contains a long-\nforgotten provision, \"the coinage clause,\" which empowered Congress \"to coin\n(create) Money.\" The ability to create money to meet the needs of the nation\nis a sovereign power, which enables a nation to have control of its own\ndestiny. The same article indicates the Founders anticipated having to borrow\nmoney on the full faith and credit of the United States. Enter the Funding Act\nof 1790, which assumed and paid off the debt of the colonies and retired the\nfinancial obligations of the newly created states now united. This was a\npowerful, object lesson in debt retirement, relevant today. It is abundantly\nclear from a plain reading of the coinage clause that the Founders never\nintended that the only way the government was to be funded was to borrow\nmoney. The needs of the nation were to come from a system of not borrowing\nwherein money was a neutral value of exchange connecting resources, people and\nneeds, without debt attached. In 1913, the passage of the Federal Reserve Act\nceded the constitutional power to create money (and control of our national\ndestiny), to the Federal Reserve, a quasi-private central bank. At this\nfateful point, the only way money could be brought into being was to borrow\nit, whereby money became equated with debt. The money system transited from\npublic control to private control, and there it has remained.

No surprise that today we are told there is not\nenough money for creating jobs, rebuilding America, health care, education and\nretirement security. But there is always money to bail out the banks. Let us\ntake the opportunity afforded in the debate over the debt ceiling to regain\ncontrol of our sovereignty and our national destiny.

            "input": "Almost a half-century ago, in 1968, the United States seemed to be falling\napart. The Vietnam War, a bitter and close presidential election, antiwar\nprotests, racial riots, political assassinations, terrorism and a recession\nlooming on the horizon left the country divided between a loud radical\nminority and a silent conservative majority. The United States avoided a civil\nwar. But America suffered a collective psychological depression, civil unrest,\ndefeat in Vietnam and assorted disasters for the next decade -- until the\nelection of a once-polarizing Ronald Reagan ushered in five consecutive\npresidential terms of relative bipartisan calm and prosperity from 1981 to\n2001. It appears as if 2017 might be another 1968. Recent traumatic hurricanes\nseem to reflect the country's human turmoil. After the polarizing Obama\npresidency and the contested election of Donald Trump, the country is once\nagain split in two. But this time the divide is far deeper, both ideologically\nand geographically -- and more 50/50, with the two liberal coasts pitted\nagainst red-state America in between. Century-old mute stone statues are torn\ndown in the dead of night, apparently on the theory that by attacking the\nConfederate dead, the lives of the living might improve. All the old standbys\nof American life seem to be eroding. The National Football League is imploding\nas it devolves into a political circus. Multimillionaire players refuse to\nstand for the national anthem, turning off millions of fans whose former\nloyalties paid their salaries. Politics -- or rather a progressive hatred of\nthe provocative Donald Trump -- permeates almost every nook and cranny of\npopular culture. The new allegiance of the media, late-night television,\nstand-up comedy, Hollywood, professional sports and universities is committed\nto liberal sermonizing. Politically correct obscenity and vulgarity among\ncelebrities and entertainers is a substitute for talent, even as Hollywood is\nwracked by sexual harassment scandals and other perversities. The smears\n\"racist,\" \"fascist,\" \"white privilege\" and \"Nazi\" -- like \"commie\" of the\n1950s -- are so overused as to become meaningless. There is now less free\nspeech on campus than during the McCarthy era of the early 1950s. As was the\ncase in 1968, the world abroad is also falling apart. The European Union,\nmodel of the future, is unraveling. The EU has been paralyzed by the exit of\nGreat Britain, the divide between Spain and Catalonia, the bankruptcy of\nMediterranean nation members, insidious terrorist attacks in major European\ncities and the onslaught of millions of immigrants -- mostly young, male and\nMuslim -- from the war-torn Middle East. Germany is once again becoming\nimperious, but this time insidiously by means other than arms. The failed\nstate of North Korea claims that it has nuclear-tipped missiles capable of\nreaching America's West Coast -- and apparently wants some sort of bribe not\nto launch them. Iran is likely to follow the North Korea nuclear trajectory.\nIn the meantime, its new Shiite hegemony in the Middle East is feeding on the\ncarcasses of Syria and Iraq. Is the chaos of 2017 a catharsis -- a necessary\nand long overdue purge of dangerous and neglected pathologies? Will the bedlam\nwithin the United States descend into more nihilism, or offer a remedy to the\nstatus quo that had divided and nearly bankrupted the country? Is the problem\ntoo much democracy, as the volatile and fickle mob runs roughshod over\nestablishment experts and experienced bureaucrats? Or is the crisis too little\ndemocracy, as populists strive to dethrone a scandal-plagued, anti-democratic,\nincompetent and overrated entrenched elite? Neither traditional political\nparty has any answers. Democrats are being overwhelmed by the identity\npolitics and socialism of progressives. Republicans are torn asunder between\nupstart populist nationalists and the calcified establishment status quo. Yet\nfor all the social instability and media hysteria, life in the United States\nquietly seems to be getting better. The economy is growing. Unemployment and\ninflation remain low. The stock market and middle-class incomes are up.\nBusiness and consumer confidence are high. Corporate profits are up. Energy\nproduction has expanded. The border with Mexico is being enforced. Is the\ninstability less a symptom that America is falling apart and more a sign that\nthe loud conventional wisdom of the past -- about the benefits of a globalized\neconomy, the insignificance of national borders and the importance of identity\npolitics -- is drawing to a close, along with the careers of those who\nprofited from it? In the past, any crisis that did not destroy the United\nStates ended up making it stronger. But for now, the fight grows over which is\nmore toxic -- the chronic statist malady that was eating away the country, or\nthe new populist medicine deemed necessary to cure it.

However, it appears there will be no rule passed to force that issue.\nGoodell had a news conference at the NFL's fall meetings that lasted about 20\nminutes and almost every question was related to the anthem and player\nprotests. Goodell's main talking point was that the NFL also will listen to\nits players about social issues and wants to be a part of the solution.\nEveryone was focused on what will happen at NFL games with the national\nanthem, which has become the most divisive issue among fans that the league\nhas seen in a long time. \"We believe everyone should stand for the anthem,\"\nGoodell said. \"That's an important part of our policy, it's also an important\npart of our game that we all take great pride in. It's also important for us\nto honor our flag and our country and we think our fans expect us to do that.\"\nThe best outcome for the NFL would be for the players to stop protesting\nwithout the league making a rule change. Goodell sounded like the league hopes\nthat if it keeps working with its players to help with their issues, with\nracial equality and law enforcement reform, then perhaps the protests will\nend. \"The fact is, we have about a half a dozen players that are protesting,\"\nGoodell said. \"We hope and we're going to continue to work to try to put that\nat zero. That's what we'd like to do. But we want to make sure we're\nunderstanding what the players are talking about, and that's complex.\" The\nnumber Goodell cited seems low, considering seven [San Francisco 49ers players\nalone took a knee for last Sunday's\nanthem](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/15/49ers-players-anthem-protest-\ncontinues-in-d-c-albeit-dwindled/), and as many as 30 49ers players were\ntaking a knee two weeks ago. But it appeared he wanted to make it a point that\nit's not as widespread of an issue as it is being made out to be. Goodell was\nasked why the NFL wouldn't make it a rule to stand. New York Giants owner John\nMara [told the Daily\nNews](https://twitter.com/garymyersNYDN/status/920714167115485184) that the\nleague has no plans to make a rule about standing for the anthem. \"We believe\nour players should stand for the national anthem. That's an important part of\nour game and our moments, and we believe in that,\" Goodell said. \"I think we\nalso have to keep focus on this: We have about six or seven players involved\nin this protest at this point. This is something, what we've tried to do is\nwe've tried to deal with the underlying issue and understand what it is\nthey're protesting and try to address that matter. The important thing for us\nis to be able to do that and take that opportunity to make real differences in\nour community. That is really what's ultimately going to be the important\naspect for us long term. Because this is a long-term issue. \"I understand the\nway our fans feel about this issue, and we feel the same way about the\nimportance of our flag, the importance of patriotism, and I believe our\nplayers feel that way. The will state to you and they have stated to everyone\npublicly, they're not doing this in any way to be disrespectful to the flag,\nbut they also understand how it's being interpreted.\" Goodell was also asked\nabout the latest tweet from President Donald Trump about the NFL. The NFL has\ndecided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our\nNational Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country! Goodell said he has\nnot talked to Trump about the anthem issue. \"We respect our country, respect\nour flag, respect our national anthem,\" Goodell said. \"I think you look at our\nclubs and what they do on a daily basis, look at our players and what they do\nand how they participate in that, we all feel very strongly about our country\nand our pride.\"\n\n",

Flames began racing up the 86-story\nbuilding, which is a popular residence for expats living in the UAE's largest\ncity. Footage of the conflagration circulating on social media shows\nfirefighters frantically trying to stop it from spreading. The Dubai Media\nOffice confirmed the UAE's Civil Defence is fighting the inferno raging at the\ntower. \"Firefighting squads from four Civil Defence stations have been\ndeployed to bring the fire under control,\" a spokesman said. Some Twitter\nusers on Thursday voiced shock at the fire burning at the Torch, which is the\nworld's fifth largest residential building at 1,105 ft. tall. Other people on\nthe social media platform noted that hundreds of people evacuated the same\nbuilding during a February 2015 fire. People across multiple social media\noutlets ranging from Facebook to Instagram, meanwhile, shared video footage of\nthe rare event. Civil Defence officials told the Sun that they had\n\"successfully evacuated\" the Torch while fire fighters tried stopping the\nblaze. The Sun reported that the 2015 fire at the same building was quickly\nbrought under control, resulting in no fatalities and seven people receiving\ntreatment for smoke inhalation. A Dubai Police spokesperson told the Gulf News\nthat the fire broke out on the tower's ninth floor before spreading four\nfloors higher. The BBC reported that the Torch boasts 676 apartments, with a\ntwo-bedroom flat starting at more than $500,000.

[1] The party's goals were to unite\nthe far-left political parties of Switzerland under a democratic socialist\nplatform. [2] The party's website reads (translated to English): \"A call to\nall these women and men of our country, who are locally involved in the social\nmovement, trade unionism, the associative fabric, environmental struggles,\ngrowth objection, food sovereignty, culture: let's create this together A new\nleft-wing political force, an ecosocialist, which is so much lacking in\nSwitzerland.\" On August 4th, 2015, Redditor launched zxz242 the subreddit\n/r/AlternativeLeft. [3] According to the Reddit's purpose, the subreddit is\nopen to all far-left leaning ideas. It reads: \"To improve communication\nbetween individuals who are dissatisfied with the behaviour and morality\ncommon to the mainstream Left and the far-Left. This is oriented to be a place\nfor Left-wing Nationalism, Left Communism, Anarchism of all branches, and any\nother form of political revisionism. Yes, syncretic politics are welcome among\nregulars and contributors, so long as they're based on empirical evidence, and\nnot on mysticism, romanticism, and traditionalism.\" On October 12th, 2015, the\nwebsite AltLeft.com was registered. [4] One month later, Rabbit, the site's\nowner, posted published his first post, entitled \"A Clockwork Greenshirt -\nIntroducing the Alt Left.\" According to the site, the AltLeft politically runs\n\"to the left of Alt-right.\" On April 9th, 2016, the Facebook group\n\"Alternative Left\" launched. [6] The group's about section reads, \"Leftist but\nagainst political correctness. Against SJWs but still socially liberal. Civil\nand cultural libertarian. Economic leftism.\" As of August 2017, the group has\nmore than 2,000 likes and 2,000 follows. On December 1st, The Washington Post\n[15] published \"Introducing the 'alt-left': The GOP's response to its alt-\nright problem.\" In the article, the Post reports that conservative advocacy\ngroup One Nation released a statement under the subject line \"\"Elizabeth\nWarren and Bernie Sanders Lead Alt-Left in Hijacking of Bipartisan Medical\nResearch Bill.\" On April 30th, 2017, YouTuber Tim Pool posted a video entitled\n\"THE RISE OF THE ALT-LEFT.\" In the video (shown below), Pool draws a\ndistinction between liberals and the \"alt-left,\" asserting that \"alt-left\"\ngroups are fringe groups \"do not do research.\" He says, \"When you're talking\nto someone who is adamant a Trump hat is triggering and could cause, you know,\nanxiety to certain marginalized voices that is 'alt-left.' That is this belief\nalmost as extreme as white nationalism.\" As of August 2017, the video has been\nviewed more than 67,000 views. On August 15th, the New York Times [13] spoke\nto researchers who said \"there is no such thing as the 'alt-left.'\" \"It did\nnot arise organically, and it refers to no actual group or movement or\nnetwork,\" Mark Pitcavage, an analyst at the Anti-Defamation League, told the\nTimes. 'It's just a made-up epithet, similar to certain people calling any\nnews they don't like 'fake news.'\" Highlights In March 2017, Vanity Fair [7]\nmagazine published an article entitled \"Why the Alt-Left Is A Problem Too,\"\nwhich pointed to far-left activist groups that supported Bernie Sanders,\nderided Hillary Clinton and reject \"identity politics\" as a problem for\nAmerican left-wing politics. On March 6th, New Republic magazine responded to\nthat article in a piece called \"Liberalism Needs the 'Alt-Left,'\" refuting\nVanity Fair's assertions. Over the next few months, many centrist and liberal\ncommentators used the term. On August 16th, 2016 MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted\nin response to another's post, \"'Alt left' -- well done. Perfect descriptor.\"\nThe tweet (shown below) received more than 120 retweets and 90 likes as of\nAugust 2017.  \"Alt left\" -- well done. Perfect descriptor. Liberal use of the\nterm \"alt left\" has largely been refuted by those within far-left groups. On\nAugust 12th, 2017, Twitter @Lukewsavage wrote, \"'Alt left' is a term quite\nliterally designed to draw equivalence between white supremacists and people\nwho want universal healthcare.\" Within four days, the tweet (shown below) has\nreceived more than 33,000 retweets and 86,000 likes.  \"Alt left\" is a term\nquite literally designed to draw equivalence between white supremacists and\npeople who want universal he Trump \"Unite The Right Rally\" Comments Following\nthe violent Unite The Right Rally that left one person dead and dozens\ninjured, President Donald Trump made a series of statements on the event.\nInitially, in a press conference he said, \"We condemn in the strongest\npossible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many\nsides.\" [8] The following day, Trump delivered another statement. He said, [9]\n\"Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and\nthugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate\ngroups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\" On August\n15th, during another press conference at Trump Tower, Trump made more comments\non his previous statements, backing up his original words (shown below). He\nsaid, \"What about the alt-left that came charging at the alt-right? Do they\nhave any semblance of guilt? What about the fact that they came charging with\nclubs in their hands?\" The reaction to Trump's comments brought the term \"alt\nleft\" into a wider conversation. Many online disagreed with Trump's\nstatements, asserting that he created a false equivalancy between white\nsupremacists and neo-Nazis and those who stand against them. The prevailing\ntake is that \"alt left\" is anyone who opposes Nazism and as America opposed\nNazism in World War II, being American makes one \"Alt-Left.\" That day,\ncomedian and actor Patton Osawalt [11] posted a picture of fictional character\nIndiana Jones punching a Nazi. He captioned the tweet (shown below, left)\n\"Liberal arts college professor brutalizes Nazi, who has a permit. More alt-\nleft indoctrination.\" The post received more than 53,000 retweets and 127,000\nlikes. Twitter user @Scott_Gilmore [12] posted a picture of the U.S. military\nstorming the beaches of Normandy, France to fight the Nazis during World War\nII. He captioned the post \"Alt-left, violently coming at the alt-right, circa\n1944.\" The post (shown below, right) received more than 42,000 retweets and\n88,000 likes.  Liberal arts college professor brutalizes Nazi, who has a\npermit. More alt-left indoctrination.  Alt-left, violently coming at the alt-\nright, circa 1944. That day, former head of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke, [10]\ntweeted his support of the president's statements. He said, \"Thank you\nPresident Trump for your honesty &amp; courage to tell the truth about\n#Charlottesville &amp; condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.\" The\ntweet (shown below) received more than 2,900 retweets and 2,000 likes.  Thank\nyou President Trump for your honesty &amp; courage to tell the truth about\n#Charlottesville &amp; condemn the leftist terrorist Trump's use of the term\nalt-left set off more criticism of the more moderate democrats use of the\nterm. On August 16th, New Republic Magazine [14] published an article entitled\n\"Liberals Helped Create Trump's New Bogeyman, the 'Alt-Left.'\" Twitter also\npointed out their issues with the term, stating that it creates a fale\nequivlancy between the left and Nazis.

Other Democrats that\nTrump called out over the summer have not indicated they will make a bid for\nthe presidency. After Trump in October tweeted he hopes Clinton will run\nagainst him, Clinton told BBC Radio 4, \"No, I'm not going to run again,\" but\nthat she would continue to speak out against Trump. Massachusetts Senator\nElizabeth Warren, who Trump refers to as \"Pocahontas\" because she claims to\nhave a Native American background, is considered a top Democratic contender.\nIn August, [she brushed off the\nidea](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/08/06/elizabeth-warren-says-shes-\nnot-running-for-president/23067703/), saying, \"I'm doing my job every single\nday.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\nin October told the Today show that if Trump runs again, \"I would support him,\nyes, but I'm not so sure what will happen.\" Shortly after, Senator Rand Paul\nsaid Republicans \"need to know (if) President Trump (is) running for re-\nelection,\" and, \"I think you won't know that until you get into sort of\nsecond, third year of his presidency.\" Trump's approval rating has remained\nvery low as a probe into whether he and his campaign colluded with Russians in\nthe 2016 election widens.

The lawyer said Erdely left out\nimportant details in her piece on purpose, like the fact that Eramo took\nJackie to the police on two separate occasions. 'Every one of her stories has\na victim, a villain and a vindicator…' \"They made a decision to remove [from\nthe article] every reference to the police and that's actual malice,\" he said.\nClare also blasted Erdely for ignoring red flags, such as Jackie's refusal to\nput her in touch with sources who could corroborate her alleged gang rape\naccount. \"Jackie's refusal to put Ms. Erdely in touch with people who could\nconfirm or deny her story was a giant, waving red flag,\" he insisted. \"Once\nthey decided what the article was going to be, it didn't matter what the facts\nwere,\" Clare added. Rolling Stone's attorney Scott Sexton countered that\nErdely put a \"tremendous amount of work\" into the article, but was ultimately\nfooled by Jackie.  \"Sabrina was acting in good faith when she wrote the\narticle with the information she had,\" he insisted. \"Our world would shut down\nif we walked out that court room door and expected everyone to lie to us.\"\nSexton also said that because Eramo is a public figure, Erdely had every right\nto criticize her. \"She is a highly compensated public servant… we are entitled\nas citizens to criticize a public figure,\" he explained. Sexton argued that\nEramo's attorneys are intent on proving that the story was republished in Dec.\n2014 -- when the magazine added an editor's note to the piece after Jackie's\nrape account had been called into question -- because they, \"have no case for\nactual malice\" before then. One of the questions jurors will be asked is\nwhether they believe that Rolling Stone \"affirmatively reiterated the content\nof any false and defamatory statements.\"\n\n",

            "input": "(C) 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP A chat with the host of the trashiest talk show\nin television history about Trump, Hillary, and the State of the Union. You\ncan see it, almost: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sitting just a few steps\nfrom each other onstage, going at each other's throats. \"It's just awfully\ngood that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the\nlaw in our country,\" Clinton levels. Trump cuts in with a threat: \"Because\nyou'd be in jail.\" The audience goes wild, collectively gasping, then\ncheering, either for their audacious, say-it-like-it-is savior, or because\nthey're just thrilled with the entertainment. Maybe a chair gets thrown. It's\nnot hard for Jerry Springer to picture some of the crazier moments from the\n2016 presidential election on the set of his eponymous talk show. After all,\nthe Jerry Springer Show traffics in drama and dysfunction, and that ugly scene\n--minus the chair throwing--played out live at the second presidential debate\nlast week, one of the most brutal in recent history. \"I've never had a guest\non my show who I thought should be president,\" says Springer, laughing. \"Ever.\nExcept the guy who married his horse.\" Faced with the prospect of a Trump\npresidency, Springer, a former Democratic mayor of Cincinnati who once ran for\ngovernor of Ohio, has thrown his hat back in the political ring to make the\ncase for Clinton. Last month, he tweeted his assessment of the options facing\nthe American people: \"Hillary Clinton belongs in the White House. Donald Trump\nbelongs on my show.\" We'll let him explain. GQ: The second debate was one of\nthe most savage--and personal--we've ever seen. How much did it remind you of\nyour show? Jerry Springer: I mean, good God. Other than his money, how in the\nworld is he different than people that are on my show? And that's not trying\nto be cute. That's the truth. I mean, I think about the issues of the people\nthat come on our show, the language they use, the relationship dysfunctions.\nYou know, other than your net worth, what is the difference, and why do people\nwind up calling people on my show trash? I've always said that wealthy people\nhaven't cornered the market on propriety or morality or decency. We keep\nthinking, just because people are poor and maybe didn't go to college or\nsomething that all of the sudden they're trash, and then we see this running\nfor president? The behavior's the same. After the first debate, you tweeted\nthat Trump belongs on your show. In the style of segments like \"My Girlfriend\nis a Man\" and \"I Married a Horse,\" what would you call the episode starring\nhim? [laughs] Great question. Oh gosh, I've gotta think…\"I'll Beat That Blank\nTo The White House.\" A hallmark of your show is when people start throwing\nchairs at each other. Be honest: Do you ever feel like thwacking Trump with a\nfolding chair? [laughs] Well, I'm nonviolent. I think he wouldn't come on my\nshow--nothing to do with chairs--he wouldn't come on my show because he\nwouldn't want his hair pulled. You know, they're always pulling off the wig?\nThat's why he wouldn't come on the show. There's been speculation that Trump\nis planning a new media empire to capitalize on his momentum after the\nelection. Are you worried he's going to take your job? \"I'm sorry.

So\nthey would have to run a graphic, they would have to keep saying, \"He's the\nhost, he's the host, he's the host.\" But other than that, yeah, he's\nphenomenal on television. You're an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter. Aside\nfrom \"she's not a demagogue,\" what's your case for her? Certainly in my\nlifetime, there's never been a human being more prepared, and more\nknowledgeable and more balanced to be president of the United States who\nhasn't already been one. In other words, when you run for reelection for\npresident, you already know all of the world issues. But for someone who\nhasn't yet been president, I don't think there's another human being that\ncould sit down with her and would know as much about what's going on in the\nworld, has thought more about all these issues for her whole lifetime, than\nshe has. She really is the most qualified person ever to run for president who\nhasn't been president before. And there's no particular benefit for me other\nthan I love my country. I mean, I'm not looking for a political job. I'm\nliterally just a citizen. And I do take it seriously. I'm [from] an immigrant\nfamily. So I take the State of Liberty very seriously. I mean, my family was\nlost in the Holocaust. We believe in the State of Liberty. This was the place\nwe were going to come. And then you have someone running for president who is\nopposed to the idea [of] America? Religious, ethnic and all that kind of\nfreedom? And wants to replace the State of Liberty with a wall? So I compare\nthat to the qualifications of a Hillary. You've talked about how the election\nis personal for you. How does it hit home? Someone comes to me and says,\n\"Well, if you knew Trump, he isn't personally bigoted.\" It doesn't matter--\nthat's irrelevant. He's smart enough to know that he is giving cover, he is\ngiving voice to a very ugly notion that you will be judged in this country\nbased on where you're from and what your religion is, what your ethnicity is,\nand in some instances, even what your color is. And gender. And your\ndisabilities, if you have any. Well, we all have some disabilities. But it's,\nlike, oh my god, this is so un-American. It's, like, a cruel irony to say\nwe're going to make America great again. Hey! First understand what America\nis. That is personal. You're the former mayor of Cincinnati. What have you\nlearned about politics in the two decades you've been doing your show that you\ndidn't know during your political career? I always knew we were all alike and\nthe only thing that separated us [is] some of us were luckier in the gene pool\nof parents, and some of us had more money, and stuff like that. And I saw that\nin politics, and I see it in the people on my show. ... 99 percent of what we\nare, we had nothing to do with. Not one person you will ever meet had anything\nto do with the decision to be born, to whom you'd be born, what kind of\nhealth, what kind of brain, what era, what country. None of this stuff. The\nlast one percent of what we become is maybe due to our own efforts. But even\nthat is based on what we were born with. If you understand that, then you will\nnever ever judge people based on what they are. You will only judge people\nbased on what they do. I guess I kind of knew that all along, and every job\nI've ever had just confirmed what I've always believed, is that human beings\nare alike. Some are just luckier. Your show is in its 26th season-- I\napologize. [laughs] I'm sorry. I've ruined the culture. I'm so sorry. Oh,\nplease, Rebecca, forgive me. I forgive you! What's one moment from this\nelection that would have been way better on your stage? Well, any of the\ndebates, clearly. And obviously the video. I mean, really. You can't even make\na parody of it anymore. I can't--it's almost, they're throwing softballs at\nme. It's, like, \"Hey! Here's a show topic, here's a show topic.\" I mean, I\ncould have done a whole season of shows just on this campaign. But again, it's\none thing to have a television [show] about that, which is the purpose of the\nshow, to have it about dysfunctional behavior, and another thing to say, \"Gee,\nwhy doesn't the person on this show run for president?\" What? Who thought that\nwas a good idea? You've said Trump's blurring of politics and entertainment\nhelped propel him to the GOP nomination. Are shows like yours to blame for\nTrump's rise? No, no one show. Lots of people watch the show and behave\nproperly.\n\n",

            "input": "Medical science is constantly making cancer breakthroughs, however there's an\nextensive process to bring treatments to the public. After making a discovery\nin the lab and performing tests, there are human clinical trials that require\noversight by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before approval. That\nbeing said, there are some promising new treatments (with some currently still\nin the investigational stages) targeting cancer, and they could prove valuable\nto millions of patients in the U.S. and beyond in the future. Here are six\nexperimental cancer treatments that are catching attention from the medical\nworld… 1\\. Hyperthermia Therapy BestMedicalDegrees.com outlines this\nexperimental use of heat to target tumors. This technique can zero in on\nspecific areas or heat the whole body, which will break down protein cells\nwithin a tumor and cause them to die, notes the source. While the treatment\ncan potentially blast away existing cells, it could also help prevent new ones\nfrom forming. \"Hyperthermia Therapy is very exciting because, if it turns out\nto be a viable treatment, this will destroy the cancerous tumors from the\ninside out and hinder its ability to infect more healthy cells,\" adds the\nsource.  2\\. Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Also called adoptive cell\ntransfer, the experimental technique aims to improve the ability of a\npatient's natural T-cells (lymphocytes for immunity) to fight cancer,\naccording to the National Cancer Institute. Doctors can take the best and most\nactive T-cells that have invaded a tumor and extract them to multiply in a lab\n- the patient's immune cells are then wiped out and the lab-grown cells are\nre-infused back to them, it adds. There are variations of this treatment, and\nthe first use of it targeted metastatic melanoma, which can spread quickly\nthrough the body. Modified T-cells are also being looked at to treat other\nsolid tumors as well as hematologic cancers (cancers of the blood), it adds.\n3\\. Molecularly Targeted Therapy ABC News says in an article that this therapy\nconsists of drugs that are aimed at destroying only specific cancer cells,\nwithout negatively affecting healthy cells as many existing treatments do.\n\"Thus, people taking the drugs too often suffer horrible side effects on top\nof whatever havoc the cancer itself is already wreaking,\" notes the source.\nABC says the leading drug in this new therapy is called Glivec (or STI571). It\nis designed to treat a specific form a leukemia called chronic myeloid\nleukemia, which has about 7,000 new cases per year in the U.S., adds the\nsource. \"Doctors are extremely hopeful that the drug could provide a model for\nsimilar drugs to treat cancers affecting many thousands more people,\" it\nnotes.  4\\. TNFR2-targeting Antibodies The National Cancer Institute detailed\na potential new cancer therapy in early 2017, which looks to target ovarian\ncancer cells. The basics are that tumor cells \"express\" a protein called\nTNFR2, which can prevent a patient's natural immune system from attacking a\ntumor. Researchers have developed new antibodies that target TNFR2, as well as\nhaving the ability to kill ovarian cancer cells, thus \"killing two birds with\none stone,\" notes the source. The team found that ovarian cancer cells express\nan abnormal level of TNFR2 that can promote tumor growth - and the source\npoints out other types of cancers, such as colon and kidney cancer, also show\nunusual TNFR2 production.  5\\. Tumor Treating Fields This therapy, which the\nAmerican Brain Tumor Association said was recently approved by the FDA for\nglioblastoma (an aggressive brain cancer), usually follows surgery and\nradiation therapy, adds the source. It involves ceramic discs called\ntransducer arrays to deliver electromagnetic energy to the scalp. \"These\nelectrical fields exert selective toxicity in proliferating cells thereby\nhalting cell division and destroying the cancer cells,\" notes the source.\nWhile the treatment is used in conjunction with oral chemotherapy drugs for\nglioblastoma (GBM), it can be used on its own to target recurrent (returning)\nGBM when other options have been exhausted, according to the source.  6\\.\nVirus Therapy Usually, having a virus is a bad thing. However, this therapy\nessentially involves introducing a virus to cancer cells that leave healthy\ncells alone, notes StandUp2Cancer.org. The virus only seeks out cancer cells\ndue to their genetic mutation that normal cells don't have, it explains. One\ntreatment in particular is called Reolysin, developed by a Canadian\nbiotechnology company, notes the source. The site notes that almost\n300-patients \"with various forms of cancer\" in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K.\nhave been treated with this therapy, which infects cancer cells and causes\nthem to explode. Apparently, side effects (such as a low-grade fever) are a\nlot milder than those associated with chemotherapy and radiation, it adds.\n\n",

Trump's\nearly morning tweets come in the wake of news that the bureau's former\ndirector had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton before the investigation\nwas over. \"Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter\nexonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete.\nMany people not interviewed, including Clinton herself,\" Trump wrote on\nTwitter. \"Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix?\nWhere is Justice Dept?\" \"As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and\ntotally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to\nher!\" the president added later. [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/james-\ncomey-fbi-clinton-emails-drafted-statement-686140) reported Monday on\ndocuments released by the FBI that included an email sent on May 2, 2016, by\nComey to other FBI officials that included a file titled \"Drafts of Director\nComeys July 5, 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of\n01.\" Despite Comey having already drafted a statement on the investigation\ninto Clinton's email practices while at the State Department, the probe would\ncontinue on for months. Clinton herself was not interviewed until July 2,\n2016, three days before Comey held a press conference to announce that the FBI\nwould not recommend filing charges against the former secretary of state. That\nComey had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton with months to go before the\ncompletion of the investigation has raised concern among Republicans on\nCapitol Hill, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Grassley\n(R-Iowa), who wrote a\n[letter](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017-08-30%20CEG%20+%20LG%20to%20FBI%20\\(Comey%20Statement\\).pdf)\nto current FBI Director Christopher Wray noting that \"the outcome of an\ninvestigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work\ntrying to gather the facts.\" While the president has complained that Comey was\ntoo easy on Clinton, the former secretary of state has made no secret that she\nbelieves it was Comey's late October 2016, announcement that the bureau was\nexamining potentially fresh evidence related to the email investigation that\ncost her the election. The evidence examined by the bureau came up fruitless,\nbut Clinton has complained that the resurfacing of the scandal so close to\nElection Day reintroduced doubt into voters' minds. Trump, who reveled in the\nbureau's investigation into Clinton throughout the campaign, fired Comey last\nMay, a move the White House initially said was based on Deputy Attorney\nGeneral Rod Rosenstein's assessment of Comey's handling of the Clinton\ninvestigation. Trump later conceded that he had already made his mind up to\nfire Comey before receiving Rosenstein's recommendation and that he had made\nthe decision with the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the\n2016 election weighing on his mind.\n\n",

A Huntington Beach police officer fatally shot a suspect outside a\n7-Eleven store Friday in a confrontation that was caught on video and posted\nonline. WARNING: VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES AND CONTENT The shooting\noccurred about 9:30 a.m. outside the store at 6012 Edinger Ave., where the\nsuspect got into a scuffle with the officer just before the shooting,\naccording to a Huntington Beach Police Department spokeswoman. The suspect\nlater died at a hospital, police said. It happened fast, and like most\neverything these days, was captured on cell phone video by a bystander. A\nHuntington Beach Police Officer, in a violent struggle with a man outside a\n7-11. The man appears to be a transient, and what spurred their initial\ninteraction is still not clear. After a few seconds of fighting...the two pull\naway, the man appears to have something in his hand. What it is is not clear.\nThe officer, a few feet away, takes aim with his handgun and fires,\nonce...twice...7 times. The suspect at first takes the shots standing up, then\ncrumbles to the ground. It's quite graphic, quite real, and quite dramatic. In\nfact, we don't even want to show it on TV it's that violent. The suspect would\nlater die at a hospital and per protocol, the Orange County Sheriff is taking\nover the investigation. What made this all the more scary was that diagonally\nacross the street is Marina High School. Police ordered it ''locked down'' and\nimmediately cell phones lit up with texts and emails between parents,\nstudents, and administrators. There was confusion and near panic among some\nover reports that there was an active shooter on campus, which there was not.\nWhy? Well, it appears that the shooting happened adjacent to a shopping center\ncalled 'Marina Village'. On campus there's an area referred to as ''The\nVillage\", so reports of a shooting in ''The Village\" or at \"The Village'' led\nto understandable confusion. Yet one of the benefits of social media and that\nfact that every student has a cell phone, is that the accurate story got out\nthere quickly and students and parents worst fears were calmed within minutes.\n[Cell phone video of the shooting was posted on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/Cali_Funk1/status/911268573170999296), showing\nthe officer firing five shots at the suspect, who stumbles, collapses against\na wall of the convenience store, then crumples to the ground.\n\n",

            "input": "The 1st Amendment is the most well known to Americans of all the amendments in\nthe Bill of Rights. It contains some of the most familiar phrases in political\ndiscussion, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech and freedom of the\npress. The 1st Amendment reads like this: \"Congress shall make no law\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of\nthe people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress\nof grievances.\" The 1st Amendment protects your right to believe and practice\nwhatever religious principles you choose and your right to say what you\nbelieve, even if it is unpopular or against the will of elected officials. It\nalso protects your right to publish any information you want, join together\nwith whomever you want and ask the government to correct its own errors. What\nexactly does the 1st Amendment mean and how does it apply to people today?\nDoes it have relevance to you today? It sure does. In fact, it affects just\nabout everything you do. The 1st Amendment has seven clauses. This page has a\nbrief description of each clause with links to more detailed information about\nthe history and purpose of each section. Seven Sections of the 1st Amendment\nOpening Phrase The Opening Phrase of the 1st Amendment says \"Congress shall\nmake no law.\" This opening phrase immediately tells exactly who this amendment\nis aimed at... and that entity is Congress. So the 1st Amendment specifically\nprohibits Congress from making laws interfering with the rights mentioned in\nthe amendment. It does not however, prohibit the states from making such laws,\nnor does it prohibit individuals from restricting these rights to those who\nmay be under their authority, such as a parent and child or an employer and an\nemployee. For one hundred years the 1st Amendment was understood to only apply\nto the federal government, but after the Civil War and the 14th Amendment was\nadded to the Constitution, courts began to forbid the states to interfere with\nthese rights as well due to an idea called \"due process of law.\" Learn more\nabout the Opening Phrase of the 1st Amendment here. Establishment Clause The\nEstablishment Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says Congress shall\nmake no law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" This is a very crucial\npart of the American Constitution. It prohibits the government from\nestablishing a state religion or denomination and from directing people in\nwhat they must believe. Without the Establishment Clause, the government could\nchoose a state religion and force everyone to participate in it. It could also\npunish anyone who didn't adhere to its chosen faith. Prayer at a football game\nThis clause has been the focus of much debate in the last half century. Some\nAmericans believe that whenever the government is involved, absolutely all\nreligious expression must be forbidden in order to comply with the\nEstablishment Clause. For example, they might say a public school football\nteam should not pray at a football game because the school is a government\nfunded school. Other Americans believe the government must make certain\nallowances for religious expressions in public events and buildings because\nAmericans are a very religious people. They belive a high school football team\nprayer or a government employee displaying a cross at work does not violate\nthe Establishment Clause because it is simply a personal expression and not an\nexpression endorsed by the state. Indeed, in the minds of some, banning\nexpressions of religious faith like this is a violation of another clause of\nthe 1st Amendment - the Free Exercise Clause, because it seeks to control the\nreligious expressions of citizens. Learn more about the history and purpose of\nthe Establishment Clause here. Free Exercise Clause The Free Exercise Clause\nis the part of the 1st Amendment that says Congress shall make no law\nrespecting the establishment of religion or \"the free exercise thereof.\" This\nphrase deals with the restriction on Congress to regulate anyone's religious\npractices. US Supreme Court In general, Congress cannot tell people how they\ncan or cannot express their religious beliefs. Such things as telling people\nwhen or how to pray, when they should go to church or to whom they should\npray, are off limits to lawmakers. In general, this is the case, but\nsometimes, minority religious groups may want to practice something that is\nnot generally accepted or that the state has a very strong interest in\nregulating. For example, polygamy, ritual sacrifice and drug usage have been\nbanned at times, because there is a compelling public interest in eliminating\nthese behaviors. In such cases, the Supreme Court has often ruled that the\nFree Exercise Clause does not apply. In other words, the Free Exercise Clause\ndoes not give free license to any behavior that someone says is their\nreligious belief. You can learn all about the Free Exercise Clause here. The\nFreedom of Speech Clause The Freedom of Speech Clause is the part of the 1st\nAmendment that says, \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of\nspeech.\" British history contained a long string of suppression by those in\nauthority of those with whom they disagreed. Many British subjects had been\nthrown in prison for voicing their religious and political beliefs. The\nAmericans intended to prevent this from ever happening in their newly formed\nrepublic. Picket line This is one of the protections in the Constitution that\nAmericans hold most dear. They value it because it allows them to speak out\nagainst government policies they don't like. It also allows them to express\nthe religious beliefs of their choosing. Negatively speaking, many people\nabuse this right by slandering people they disagree with, or using ugly and\noffensive language, racial epithets or hateful language about people who are\ndifferent than they are. Generally, freedom of speech is considered to be not\nonly the words people speak, but any type of expression that is used to convey\nan idea. Such things as picketing, wearing symbols or burning the flag are\nconsidered protected forms of speech because they are expressing the ideas of\nthe people participating in them.

Freedom of the Press Clause The Freedom of the\nPress Clause states that \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the\nfreedom... of the press.\" Freedom of the Press Clause This was a very\nimportant principle to the Founding Fathers of America because of the\nimportance the press played during the Revolutionary War. Without the press,\nthe Founding Fathers would have found it very difficult to distribute their\nviews to people in other parts of the country. The press turned out to be a\nvery important instigation in getting Americans to consolidate their views\nagainst England and in spreading the concepts that would justify a break with\nEngland. English history contained no freedoms for the press whatsoever. All\npublications were subject to governmental review before publication.\nCriticisms of the government were strictly prosecuted as sedition. All\nAmericans wanted the right to criticize their government freely as well as to\ndiscuss other topics whenever they chose.

Freedom of Assembly\nClause Civil Rights Protest The Freedom of Assembly Clause is the part of the\nFirst Amendment that reads like this: \"Congress shall make no law...\nabridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble...\" This clause is\nalso sometimes referred to as the Freedom of Association Clause. This clause\nprotects the right to assemble in peace to all Americans. The Freedom of\nAssembly was very important to early Americans because without the right to\nassemble, they could not coordinate their opposition to the British\ngovernment. The Freedom of Assembly was recognized to be of utmost importance\nif the Americans were to be successful in establishing a government of the\npeople. The Freedom of Assembly Clause has been relied upon by many groups in\nAmerican history, such as civil rights groups, women's suffrage groups and\nlabor unions. Government officials in each case tried to restrict the speech\nof these groups and prevent them from meeting, organizing and getting their\nmessage out. The Freedom of Assembly proved to be an important factor that\nallowed these groups to prosper and see their visions fulfilled. You can learn\nmore about the history and importance of the Freedom of Assembly Clause here.\nFreedom of Petition Clause  Save The Freedom of Petition Clause of the 1st\nAmendment reads like this: \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the\nfreedom... of the people... to petition the Government for a redress of\ngrievances.\" The freedom to petition the government was very important to\nearly Americans because of their experience with trying to get King George III\nand Parliament to respond to their grievances. The colonists were so angry\nabout the Monarchy's refusal to acknowledge their grievances that they\nmentioned this fact in the Declaration of Independence. The freedom to\npetition the government for redress of grievances has come to include the\nright to do such things as picketing, protesting, conducting peaceful sitins\nor boycotts and addressing government officials through any media available.\nYou can read more about the history and meaning of the Freedom of Petition\nClause here.

            "input": "Hillary Clinton is beginning to increase her odds of winning Florida in many\nelection forecasts, while other models say that Donald Trump is now likely to\ncapture the state. On November 6th, FiveThirtyEight was forecasting a Donald\nTrump victory in Florida, giving him a 52.5 percent chance of winning. The\nstate has flipped from red to blue in the past 24 hours; as of November 7th,\n[the FiveThirtyEight model](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-\nforecast/florida/) now gives Donald Trump a 48.5 percent chance of winning\nFlorida, with Hillary Clinton having the better odds of 51.6 percent. On their\nforecast, we can see a clear dip that occurs in the immediate aftermath of the\nnews that the FBI would be looking into new emails relevant to the Hillary\nClinton investigation, but now her lead is beginning to rise again.\nFiveThirtyEight is also forecasting that Hillary Clinton will win 48.2 percent\nof the popular vote in Florida, while Donald Trump will receive 48.0 percent\nof it. But [in The New York Times' The\nUpshot](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-\nforecast.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fupshot&action=click&contentCollection=upshot&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0),\nFlorida is actually beginning to move in Donald Trump's direction. On November\n6th, the Times' model gave Hillary Clinton a 70 percent chance of winning the\nstate, but now, this number has gone down to 66 percent. And two weeks ago,\nbefore the FBI news was released, Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of\nwinning Florida on The Upshot. The model currently gives Clinton an 84 percent\nchance of becoming the next president. Clearly, Clinton does not absolutely\nneed Florida to win, while Donald Trump almost certainly can't reach 270\nElectoral College votes without it. On\n[PredictWise](http://predictwise.com/politics), Hillary Clinton now has better\nodds of winning Florida than she did yesterday. On November 6th, Clinton was\ngiven a 73 percent chance of winning Florida by PredictWise, but now that has\ngone up two points to 75 percent. Surprisingly, PredictWise is actually giving\nClinton better odds of winning Florida today than she had prior to the FBI\nannouncement on October 28th. Hours before that news dropped, Clinton's odds\nof winning Florida were at 72 percent. In the aftermath of that bombshell, her\nodds fell all the way down to 58 percent, but she has now more than recovered\nfrom it. Nationally, PredictWise gives Clinton an 89 percent chance of winning\nthe election, up two points since yesterday. Meanwhile, a dramatic shift has\ntaken place on [The Huffington Post's\nforecast](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/forecast/president). On\nSunday, this model gave Clinton a 93 percent chance of winning Florida, and\nthe state was placed in the \"probable Clinton\" column. Twenty-four hours\nlater, Florida has been moved into the \"battleground\" column, and her odds of\nwinning the state have dropped down to 89 percent. The Huffington Post has\nalso moved North Carolina from \"probable Clinton\" into \"battleground.\" One day\nago, Clinton's projected minimum number of Electoral College votes was 317,\nbut now that has dropped down to 273. Clinton has seen a very slight bump in\n[DailyKos](http://elections.dailykos.com/app/elections/2016)' election\nforecast, though. On November 6th, they gave her a 74 percent chance of\nwinning Florida, but that has now gone up one point to 75 percent. This bump\nalso came as DailyKos released its final election prediction. They expect\nHillary Clinton to win 323 Electoral College votes - including that of North\nCarolina and Florida - and Donald Trump to win 215 votes. It's easy to see why\nall these shifts have taken place, as several key Florida polls were released\non Monday that show the race to be much tighter than it was just one day ago.\nYesterday, Hillary Clinton was ahead in Real Clear Politics' Florida polling\naverage by 0.9 percentage points, but today, [Trump leads by 0.3\npercent.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html)\nNo polls have yet been released that reflect the FBI's recent announcement\nthat they would still not be recommending charges against Hillary Clinton\nafter reviewing the new set of e-mails, so it remains to be seen if Clinton\nwill be able to recover even more of her lead in the aftermath of that news. 6\nComments\n\n",

At a rally in Greensboro, N.C.,\nTrump said these accusations are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton\ncampaign and what he called \"the corrupt media.\" Greg Gutfeld agreed with much\nof Trump's assessment on \"The Five\" today, saying, \"The media wants Hillary to\nwin. There's no doubt about that.\" Judge Jeanine on Trump Accusers: 'All on\nOne Day? It's a Little Too Convenient' Gutfeld explained that Trump has\nactually been \"set up,\" as he was given countless hours of coverage and\n\"billions of dollars of free media,\" only to have the rug pulled out from\nunder him. \"The media ... [and] Hillary and Obama, they knew elevating Donald\nTrump - giving him an air of respectability in the press, as well - turned him\ninto the Republican nominee.

            "input": "(CNSNews.com) - Continuing a series of tweets on lax border security\nWednesday, President Donald Trump promised quick action: \"We will be taking\nstrong action today,\" he promised, without getting specific. His full tweet,\ncoming shortly after 7 a.m., read: \"Our Border Laws are very weak while those\nof Mexico &amp; Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era,\nand other, laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour\ninto our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he plans to send the U.S. military to guard the border\nwith Mexico: \"We have very bad laws for our border, and we are going to be\ndoing some things -- I've been speaking with General Mattis -- we're going to\nbe doing things militarily,\" said Trump at a White House meeting with leaders\nof the Baltic nations. \"Until we can have a wall and proper security, we're\ngoing to be guarding our border with the military,\" he said. \"That's a big\nstep. We really haven't done that before, or certainly not very much before.\"\nSince Easter Sunday, when Fox News and The Drudge Report featured news about a\ncaravan of Central Americans making their way to the United States through\nMexico, Trump has issued a dozen tweets on border security. On April 3, he\ntweeted: The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and\nheading to our \"Weak Laws\" Border, had better be stopped before it gets there.\nCash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries\nthat allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW! WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN\nBORDER! On April 2: As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not\neasily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they\ncame from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico &amp; Canada\nhave tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS\nHonduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to,\nsends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION\nPOLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL.\nDemocrats allow open borders, drugs and crime! DACA is dead because the\nDemocrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA\nbandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with\nproper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!\nMexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours\nare pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they\nwill stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least\nuntil Congress changes our immigration laws! Mexico has the absolute power not\nto let these large \"Caravans\" of people enter their country. They must stop\nthem at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws\nwork, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective\nborder laws. Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear\nOption if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border\nPatrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to\ndo their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen! On April 1:\nBorder Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border\nbecause of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release.\nGetting more dangerous. \"Caravans\" coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear\nOption to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL! Mexico is doing very little,\nif not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their\nSouthern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration\nlaws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash\ncow, NAFTA. NEED WALL! These big flows of people are all trying to take\nadvantage of DACA. They want in on the act!

Matthew,\nthe most powerful hurricane to strike the Caribbean since 2007, made landfall\nin southwestern Haiti on Tuesday as a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained\nwinds of 230 kph. Casualties A partial evaluation indicates that more than\n20,000 homes were severely damaged, Joseph said, describing the storm's impact\nas a \"catastrophe.\" The search for additional casualties continues,\nauthorities said. Most of the victims were killed by falling trees, flying\ndebris and swollen rivers. Due to the emergency declaration in Florida, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency are\nauthorised to coordinate all disaster relief efforts, Xinhua news agency\nreported. Evacuation order Meanwhile, local authorities issued a mandatory\nevacuation order on Thursday for nearly 1.5 million coastal residents in\npreparation for the hurricane, one of the most powerful storms to hit the\nregion in a decade. \"This storm will kill you. We don't have much time left,\"\nsaid Florida Governor Rick Scott at a press conference. According to the US\nNational Hurricane Centre in Miami, Florida, Hurricane Matthew remained a\nCategory 3 hurricane as of Thursday morning. There was still possibility that\nit would evolve into a Category 4 storm in approaching the east coast of\nFlorida, said the Centre. Matthew is now moving on to the coast of the US. The\nUS National Weather Service warned on Thursday that the hurricane could be the\nworst storm seen in Florida for decades. Over 2 million people have been\nordered to evacuate coastal areas.\n\n",

On Friday, the sheriff reported no evidence of excessive force, and\nhe showed the controversial interaction between Bennett and officers.\nAccording to the department, officers were investigating an active shooter\ncall -- which turned out to be false -- and Bennett running quickly prompted a\nchase. The chase ended with the controversial encounter. Scroll down below to\nread expanded sections on what happened. Related coverage The events leading\nup to the encounter The Las Vegas Police Department has shared body camera\nvideo during a news conference of the scene that unfolded outside and inside\nthe casino-hotel, The Cromwell and Drai Nightclub, leading up to the incident\nwith Bennett on August 27. The video shows officers responding to an active\nshooter call, which turned out to be false. According to police, a stanchion\nwas knocked over during a fight, which prompted reports of a shooting.

See video of when chaos unfolded, and scroll down to\nkeep reading. In the body camera video, officers can be heard telling people\nto leave casino. Thousands of people were in the area at the time of the\nactive shooter call, according to police. Bennett was crouched down as\nofficers approached, and then he quickly ran, and jumped over a ledge onto\nbusy Flamingo Boulevard. This led officers to chase him and order him to the\nground, police said. Watch the video of his interaction with officers while in\nthe back of a police car below. Scroll down to read Bennett's letter. After\ndigging into 861 tapes, police released new body camera video on Friday that\nshowed officers putting Bennett in the back of the police car. Bennett is\npanicked, asking what he did wrong, and pleading to be let go. Sheriff Joe\nLombardo said the video shows some claims that Bennett made were not true,\nsuch as a gun being held to his head. Lombardo said that while officers had a\ngun in hand while putting Bennett in cuffs, it was not directed at his head.\nAs for the claims officers said they would, \"blow his ******* head off,\"\nLombardo reports his department found no evidence of that. What Bennett says\nin his letter Bennett wrote in his letter that he was visiting Las Vegas to\nwatch the Mayweather-McGregor fight, and he was on the way to his hotel when\nhe was detained. According to Bennett's statement, police ordered him to the\nground at gunpoint, jammed a knee into his back and handcuffed him so tight\nthat his fingers went numb. According to Bennett, one officer placed a gun\nnear his head and warned him if he moved his would \"blow his ******* head\noff.\" In his letter, Bennett called it an excessive use of force, simply\nbecause he was a \"black man in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Read his\nfull letter below, and scroll down to watch video of part of the encounter. A\nbrief video obtained by TMZ Sports surfaced just hours after the letter. It\nshowed part of the encounter between police and Bennett, where he lay on the\nground as an officer puts him in handcuffs. \"I wasn't doing nothing, man,\"\nBennett is heard saying in the video. \"They told us to get out and everybody\nran.\" Bennett's attorney on the encounter Bennett's attorney, John Burris in\nOakland, California, said he believed the TMZ 30-second video clip showed some\nof how his client was treated. \"We think there was an unlawful detention and\nthe use of excessive force, with a gun put to his head,\" Burris told The\nAssociated Press. \"He was just in the crowd. He doesn't drink or do drugs. He\nwasn't in a fight. He wasn't resisting. He did nothing more or less than\nanyone in the crowd.\" Burris said Bennett waited to make public his account of\nthe incident until after Burris contacted Las Vegas police last week by letter\nand email, seeking police records of Bennett's detention. What NVMPD say about\n'bias-based policing' In addition to explaining the events leading up to the\nencounter, police commented on social media commentary that the detention was\nmotivated by race. \"Many of the folks ... have called this an incident of\nbiased-based policing … police officers focused solely on the race of an\nindividual … I can tell you as I stand here today I see no evidence of that,\"\nsaid NVMPD Undersheriff Kevin McMahill. \"In fact as you may have noticed,\nwhile officers were searching the casino they were able to evacuate many\npatrons of all races. It's also important for me to note to you both of the\nofficers involved in this incident in question are of Hispanic origin,\"\nMcMahill said. McMahill invited Bennett and his legal team to make a formal\nstatement to the officers. According to McHill, after his detention, Bennett\ntold officers that he understood the events that led to the incident. He did\nmention to police that he had an issue with the officer who held a gun to his\nhead. In their second news conference, Lombardo commended the officers for\nfollowing their training, and he called them heroic for running into a\npossible active shooter situation. One of the officers involved in the\nincident did not have his body camera activated. About Bennett as an advocate\nBennett is one of the 200 NFL players who didn't participate in the national\nanthem over the weekend in the wake of President Donald Trump suggesting the\nNFL bar players from kneeling in protest. The entire Seahawks team also didn't\nparticipate during the anthem and sat out in the lockerroom before their game\nagainst the Tennessee Titans. Over the last year, Bennett has been a leader of\nthe national anthem protests started by former 49ers quarterback Colin\nKaepernick. Before President Trump's comments on the NFL, Bennett gave this\nreason for his protesting: \"I have always held the strong conviction that\nprotesting or standing up for justice is just simply the right thing to do.\nThis fact is unequivocally, without question, why before every game, I sit\nduring the national anthem - because equality doesn't live in this country,\nand no matter how much money you make, what job title you have or have much\nyou give, when you are seen as a 'n*****,' you will be treated that way.\" Pete\nCarroll supports his players and Bennett. At a news conference on Monday,\nCarroll told reporters he understands why people are upset with the protests,\nbut he hopes that they listen. \"It is not about denigration of the flag or our\ncountry,\" Carroll said. \"We all can learn what we want to learn out of this,\nbut I hope we learn about empathy.\" (C) 2018 Cox Media Group.\n\n",

But when\nyou rely on info that's wrong, chances increase that your decisions are wrong.\nSo it is with Florida's solar power ballot Amendment 1. Opponents are\nfunneling misinformation into the discussion. The truth is that by voting for\nAmendment 1, Florida voters have a historic opportunity to advance solar power\nin the Sunshine State, at the same time ensuring that energy consumers are\ntreated fairly; this includes those who choose solar and those who do not.\nWhat does the amendment do? It constitutionally guarantees individuals and\nbusinesses the right to buy or lease solar equipment to produce their own\nenergy; this means consumers will always have the right to generate their own\nsolar electricity, and politicians cannot tamper with that right. Contrary to\nwhat opponents say, solar customers can still sell any excess electricity they\ngenerate back into the electric grid. More importantly, it protects Florida\nconsumers from scams, rip-offs, overcharging and unfair subsidies. It treats\nall electricity consumers fairly. Because it is renewable energy, a tax break\nis provided. This is because renewable solar energy aids in protecting the\nenvironment. If you choose not to install solar, you won't be required to\nsubsidize the costs of electric grid access and back-up power to those who do.\nAnother good point made by Florida TaxWatch is that, for Floridians who want\nthe right to provide their own energy needs, \"this amendment raises that right\nto Constitutional status, which strengthens that right, as it cannot be\nchanged by state or local governments without going back to the voters.\"\nSomething else you should know, since we are seeing political leftists like\nthe League of Women Voters dishing out misinformation to welcoming publishers\nlike The Palm Beach Post (which editorially calls Amendment 1 a \"fraud\"), is\nthat this ballot initiative is being supported by a wide list of groups other\nthan utility companies. These include bipartisan coalitions of business,\ncivic, non-profit and faith-based organizations working to promote solar\nenergy without sacrificing common sense consumer protection. Many of those\nopposing Amendment 1 are companies that don't want you to buy your own solar\npanels to generate your own electricity because they want you to buy solar\nelectricity from them. Their business model is to lock consumers into 20-year\ncontracts to put their solar equipment on your roof and sell you the\nelectricity from it. And here's the awful catch: The current published price\nfor one of the leading companies, Solar City, is nearly 50% higher than what\naverage Floridians pay for electricity today, plus its contract includes an\nautomatic 2.9% cost increase--double what Floridians normally face. Something\nelse these opponents fail to divulge is that they want a subsidy to operate\ntheir business model in Florida, a \"stand-by charge\" uniformly applied to\nevery electric customer to ensure their model makes economic sense--for them.\nI do not believe that's good for Floridians. Amendment 1 protects consumers\nfrom this type of subsidy. The Amendment does not block ownership of solar, it\ndoes not make solar more expensive, and it certainly does not discourage\npeople from installing solar on their homes. These are outright lies to pull\nthe wool over your eyes. Florida deserves a holistic approach to solar.\nThankfully, Amendment 1 will provide a constitutional framework for solar in\nthe Sunshine State, which will keep politicians and special interest groups\nfrom tampering with it.\n\n",

[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text\nversion below transcribed directly from audio. (2)] I am happy to join with\nyou today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for\nfreedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, [a great\nAmerican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln), in whose symbolic\nshadow we stand today, signed the [Emancipation\nProclamation](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-\ndocuments/emancipation-proclamation). This momentous decree came as a great\nbeacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the\nflames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long\nnight of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not\nfree. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled\nby the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred\nyears later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a\nvast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still\nlanguished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in\nhis own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\nIn a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the\narchitects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and\nthe [Declaration of\nIndependence](http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/declarationofindependence.htm),\nthey were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\nThis note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men,\nwould be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit\nof Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this\npromissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of\nhonoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad\ncheck, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse\nto believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that\nthere are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this\nnation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon\ndemand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to\nthis hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no\ntime to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug\nof gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is\nthe time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the\nsunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the\nquicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the\ntime to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal\nfor the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer\nof the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an\ninvigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an\nend, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off\nsteam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns\nto business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in\nAmerica until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of\nrevolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright\nday of justice emerges. But there is something that I must say to my people,\nwho stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the\nprocess of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful\ndeeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the\ncup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high\nplane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to\ndegenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the\nmajestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new\nmilitancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a\ndistrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by\ntheir presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up\nwith our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is\ninextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we\nmust make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\nThere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be\nsatisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of\nthe unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long\nas our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the\nmotels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. **We cannot be satisfied\nas long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger\none. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their\nself-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\"**\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a\nNegro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are\nnot satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like\nwaters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"1 I am not unmindful that some\nof you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have\ncome fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where\nyour quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution\nand staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of\ncreative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is\nredemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South\nCarolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and\nghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and\nwill be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you\ntoday, my friends. And so even though we face the difficulties of today and\ntomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American\ndream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the\ntrue meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all\nmen are created equal.\" I have a dream that one day on the red hills of\nGeorgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be\nable to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one\nday even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of\ninjustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an\noasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will\none day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their\nskin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today! I have a\ndream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its\ngovernor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and\n\"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black\ngirls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as\nsisters and brothers. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day every\nvalley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the\nrough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight;\n\"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it\ntogether.\"2 This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the\nSouth with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of\ndespair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the\njangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With\nthis faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle\ntogether, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing\nthat we will be free one day. And this will be the day -- this will be the day\nwhen all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning: My country\n'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers\ndied, land of the Pilgrim's pride, From every mountainside, let freedom ring!\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. And so let\nfreedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring\nfrom the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening\nAlleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of\nColorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not\nonly that: Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring\nfrom Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and\nmolehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. And when\nthis happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every\nvillage and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to\nspeed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews\nand Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing\nin the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God\nAlmighty, we are free at last!3 ** = Content within red asterisks absent from\nthis audio.

            "input": "\"In fourteen hundred and ninety two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue…. Today,\nChristopher Columbus is celebrated as a mythical hero by some - complete with\nsongs, poems, and fictional tales about his great adventure across the\nAtlantic to explore the majestic land that would eventually be known as the\nAmericas. There are fifty four communities named after the explorer in the\nUnited States, including the District of Columbia. \"Hail, Columbia\" was the\nUnited States' unofficial national anthem until 1931. A federal holiday,\n\"Columbus Day,\" is celebrated every second Monday in October. Despite all of\nthis, historians have begun to tear down the Columbus myth: That he discovered\nAmerica. That he proved the world wasn't flat. ( That had been well-known for\nmore than a millennium in Columbus' time. In fact, scholars had a pretty good\nidea of what the circumference of the Earth was, which was part of the dissent\nagainst Columbus making his trip- Columbus thought Asia was bigger than it is\nand the world much smaller, leading one of the scholars commissioned by the\nmonarchy to investigate the plausibility of Columbus' journey succeeding to\nsay, it was \"impossible to any educated person\"). That he came to America in\nthe name of exploration. And, finally, that he came in peace. Quite simply,\nmost of these \"facts\" are unequivocally false or half-truths. Columbus sailed\nthe ocean blue to look for wealth and, officially, in the name of\nChristianity. What he mostly did, though, was enslave and rape the natives he\nmet, sold girls (as young as nine by his own account) into prostitution, and\ncommitted numerous acts so heinous that he was forcibly removed from power and\nsent back to Spain in chains. Christopher Columbus was brutal, even by the\nstandards of his age, leading [Bartolome de las\nCasa](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-\nauthor=Bartolome%20de%20Las%20Casas&linkCode=ur2&search-\nalias=books&sort=relevancerank&tag=vicastingcom-20&text=Bartolome%20de%20Las%20Casas&linkId=XKBNSFYXMQBJ4XUO),\nwho accompanied Columbus on one of his voyages, to write in his The History of\nthe Indies, \"Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no\nage can parallel… My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that\nnow I tremble as I write.\" In August 1492, Columbus departed Spain with three\nships - the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Santa Clara (nicknamed \"the\nNina\"). After two months on the high seas, land was spotted. Now, before they\nhad left, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had promised to whoever spotted\nland first a reward of a silken jacket and an annuity of ten thousand\nmaravedis. The lookout on the Pinta was Rodrigo de Triana and he was the first\nto spot land. He shouted to the rest of the crew down below, and the Pinta's\ncaptain announced the discovery with cannon fire. When it came time to receive\nthe reward though, [Columbus\nclaimed](http://www.ems.kcl.ac.uk/content/etext/e019.html#d0e393) he actually\nsaw a light in the distance several hours prior to Triana's shout, \"but it was\nso indistinct that I did not dare to affirm it was land.\" The reward\nreportedly went to Columbus. Upon landing on the island, which he would call\nSan Salvador (present-day Bahamas), Columbus immediately went to work finding\ngold and enslaving the native populations. Specifically, Columbus, upon seeing\nthe Arawaks (the peoples of the region) come out of the forests frightened of\nthe men with swords, but bearing gifts, wrote in his journal, They do not bear\narms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the\nedge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They would make fine servants . . .\nwith fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.\nAs other European visitors would observe, the Arawaks were legendary for their\nhospitality and their desire to share. Again saying Columbus about the\nArawaks, \"are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has\nnot witnessed them would believe it. When you ask for something they have,\nthey never say no. To the contrary, they offer to share with anyone.\" Columbus\nquickly took advantage of this. Seeing that they wore gold studs in their\nears, he rounded up of a number of Arawaks and had them lead him to where gold\nwas. The journey took them to present day Cuba and Haiti (but Columbus thought\nit was Asia), where they found specks of gold in the river, but not the\nenormous \"fields\" Columbus was expecting. Nonetheless, he wrote back to Spain\nsaying that, \"There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other\nmetals.\" This report earned him financing for a second voyage, this time with\n13 ships and twelve hundred men. While he never ended up filling up these\nships with gold, he filled them with another \"currency\" and one that would\nhave a horrendous effect on the world going forward - slaves. In 1495,\nColumbus arrived back in the New World and immediately took 1500 Arawaks as\nprisoners. Of those 1500, he picked 500 to be shipped back to Spain as slaves\n(about two hundred died on the journey back), starting the transatlantic slave\ntrade. The rest were forced to find what little gold existed in the region.\nAccording to noted historian Howard Zinn, anyone over 14 had to meet a gold\nquota. If they didn't find enough gold, they would have their hands cut off.\nEventually, when it was realized there wasn't much gold in the region,\nColumbus and his men just took the rest as slaves and put them to work on\ntheir newly established estates in the region. Many natives died and their\nnumbers dwindled. In the 15th century, modern historians believe there were\nabout 300,000 Arawaks. By 1515, there were only 50,000 left. By 1531, 600 and\nby 1650, there were no longer any full-blooded Arawaks left on the islands.\nThe way Columbus and his men treated the women and children of these\npopulations was even worse. Columbus routinely used the raping of women as a\n\"reward\" for his lieutenants. For example, here's an account from one of\nColumbus' friends and compatriots, Michele de Cuneo, who accompanied Columbus\non his second journey to the New World, on what Michele did to a native \"Carb\nwoman.\" Michele wrote that, While I was in the boat I captured a very\nbeautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral [Columbus] gave to me, and\nwith whom, having taken her into my cabin, she being naked according to their\ncustom, I conceived desire to take pleasure. I wanted to put my desire into\nexecution but she did not want it and treated me with her finger nails in such\na manner that I wished I had never begun. But seeing that (to tell you the end\nof it all), I took a rope and thrashed her well, for which she raised such\nunheard of screams that you would not have believed your ears. Finally we came\nto an agreement in such manner that I can tell you that she seemed to have\nbeen brought up in a school of whores… Going further, Columbus wrote in a\nletter from 1500, A hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as\nfor a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go\nabout looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand. As\nillustrated in a recently discovered 48 page report found in the Spanish\narchives written by Francisco De Bobadilla (charged with investigating\nColumbus' rule at the behest of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, who were\ntroubled by allegations of some of Columbus' acts), a woman who verbally\ninsulted Columbus' family was stripped naked and made to ride around the\ncolony on a mule. After the trip was done, her tongue was cut out by the order\nof Columbus' brother, Bartolome, who Columbus then congratulated for\nsuccessfully defending the family's honor. Needless to say, these and numerous\nother such acts ultimately resulted in De Bobadilla having Columbus removed\nfrom power and sent back to Spain in chains. After Columbus came, and was\nforced out, the Spaniards continued his policy of enslavement and violence. In\n1552, the Spanish historian and friar Bartolome de las Casas published\nmultiple volumes under the title The History of Indies. In it, he described\nthe collapse of the non-European population. Casas writes that when the men\nwere captured and forced to work in mines looking for gold, rarely if ever\nreturning home, it significantly impacted the birth rate. If a woman did give\nbirth, she would be so overworked herself and malnourished, that she often\ncould not produce enough milk for the baby. He even reported that some of the\nwomen \"drowned their babies from sheer desperation.\" There are lot more\nexamples, writings, and research that points to one fact - Christopher\nColumbus was a lamentable individual. Nobody's perfect- if we restricted\ncelebrated individuals to those who didn't have any major flaws, we'd have few\nhumans to celebrate- and it's extremely important to view things in the\ncontext of the time individuals lived in. But even in his age, many of his\nacts were considered deplorable by his peers, which is in no small part why\nColumbus was arrested for his conduct in the New World. Combined with his\ntruly historic and widespread impact being incidental to what he was actually\ntrying to do (so a little hard to celebrate him for even that side of his\nlife), maybe it is time that we let go of the myths we learned about\nChristopher Columbus in elementary school and stop celebrating Columbus, the\nman.

Further, while it is still somewhat up for debate if\nColumbus and his crew brought syphilis to the New World or if they brought it\nfrom the New World to Europe (the latter generally being the favored theory),\nwhat isn't argued is that Columbus inadvertently quickened and widen the\nspread of these dangerous diseases on both sides of the Atlantic.

More and more\nwomen are reporting that Harvey Weinstein harassed or sexually assaulted them.\nAfter an [explosive piece in The New York\nTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-\nallegations.html), which cited several women's firsthand accounts of\nWeinstein's alleged \"sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact,\" it\nappears the dam has broken. Yesterday, [a piece in The New Yorker quoted\nnearly a dozen on the record firsthand accounts of Weinstein's harassment and\nsexual assault](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-\novertures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-\nstories?mbid=social_twitter) and included never-before-heard audio recordings\nfrom a New York Police Department sting operation in which Weinstein appears\nto admit to groping model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. Although [Weinstein\napologized in a statement for at least some of the\nbehavior](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/us/statement-from-\nharvey-weinstein.html) referenced in the New York Times article, he denied the\nsexual assault allegations following the New Yorker piece's release. That\npiece, a gut-punch for anyone holding out hope the worst wasn't true, was\nnotably written by journalist Ronan Farrow. Farrow is the estranged son of\nWoody Allen, another Hollywood magnate accused of sexual assault. Those\nallegations (which Allen denies) [were made by his own daughter, Ronan's\nsister Dylan](https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-\nfrom-dylan-farrow/). With so many accusers against Weinstein now on the\nrecord, including household names like Gwyneth Paltrow, Cara Delevingne and\nAngelina Jolie, all corners of the country are offering their hot takes in the\ndiscussion. Perhaps one of the most unfortunate reactions has been to\npoliticize the story, as some conservative pundits have grasped onto Weinstein\n-- a major Democratic donor Michelle Obama once publicly praised as a\n\"wonderful human being\" -- as illustrative of rotten liberal America. But this\nisn't a uniquely Democratic problem. Fox News, a notoriously right-wing news\noutlet, has had to dismiss a slew of on-air talent because of sexual assault\nallegations. Our Republican president appeared to admit on tape to sexually\nassaulting women (and has [also been photographed chumming it up with\nWeinstein](https://twitter.com/Ike_Saul/status/916326817031696384)). The point\nbeing: this isn't a partisan or even a political issue. This is -- largely --\nan issue with men, specifically men who yield any kind of power. The\nallegations leveled against Weinstein, Allen, Bill Cosby, Bill O'Reilly, Roger\nAiles, Anthony Weiner and President Trump are not unique to Hollywood or a\ncertain political party. It's not always famous and powerful men, either: it's\nthe Catholic Church, Penn State football, orthodox Jews, professional\nathletes, universities, and your local retail store. The list goes on. In many\nof the cases that have made national headlines, though, wealthy men in\npositions of significant power have leveraged their status to pressure or\nforce women into sexual encounters. Those women are then shamed, threatened\nwith lawsuits and silenced if they speak out.  Perhaps most unsettling about\nthese stories is that there is almost always someone who could have stepped up\nand stopped the harassment or assault. In Farrow's story, he wrote that 16\nformer and current employees of Weinstein's companies had witnessed or had\nknowledge of unwanted sexual advances Weinstein made in work-related settings.\nSixteen! And that's just the number of current or former employees who\nhappened to speak to Farrow. What about all the ones who didn't? What about\nthe ones who were too scared to speak to a reporter? Weinstein's case, again,\nisn't unique. In President Trump's infamous Hollywood Access tape, television\nhost Billy Bush laughs offthe notion that Trump could simply \"grab women by\nthe pussy\" because he was a star. His supporters and advisers dismissed it as\n\"locker room talk.\" Former Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly and former CEO Roger\nAiles were repeatedly reported to human resources at Fox Newsand, reportedly,\nno action was taken. Football coach Joe Paterno was let go from Penn State\nbecause of what he may or may not have known about convicted rapist Jerry\nSandusky. An entire film was made about the Catholic Church spending years\ntrying to fend off reporters who wanted to get the truth out about rampant\nsexual abuse by priests. In many cases, campus rape stories include bystanders\nwho don't intervene when a clearly intoxicated woman is taken home by a less\nintoxicated man. People -- especially men who are in positions of power --\nhave the ability to step in and stop these stories from happening. And we\ncannot forget that there are male survivors of sexual assault, and they are\nevery bit as worth protecting. Terry Crews came out on Twitter to share a\nstory about being assaulted by another man who allegedly grabbed his penis\nwhile Crews was standing next to his wife at a Hollywood function. Crews said\nhe decided not to retaliate with allegations against the man because he didn't\nwant to be ostracized, noting that \"the predator has power and influence.\"\nInstead, he let it go, like many women do, because he couldn't stop asking\nhimself if anyone believe him and if the repercussions for speaking out would\nbe life-changing. If Terry Crews, a wealthy, well-known man is wary of\nreporting his assault, imagine the obstacles that face many other sexual\nassault survivors. It's time for men to police our own communities, our own\nfriends and our own family members. It's time for men to stop being passive\nobservers of the kinds of harassment and overt sexism that are all too common\nin the spaces we dominate. It's time for men to stand up for the victims we\nsee in our day-to-day lives, and to create spaces, environments, communities,\nteams, companies and homes where everyone feels safe and supported enough to\nspeak truth to power. The issue of sexual assault cannot simply be a \"women's\nissue.\" It cannot be a political talking point. It cannot be a Democrat or\nRepublican or religious or campus issue. Sexual assault is a men's issue. It\nis my issue. It is your issue. And it's about time we did something about it.\n\n",

In the letter, Goodell said the \"current dispute over the National\nAnthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now\ndividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country.\" Goodell, who\nadded that he's proud of the players and owners who have worked over the last\nyear to \"attempt to address the underlying issues within their communities,\"\nsaid the NFL believes everyone should stand for the anthem. \"Like many of our\nfans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem,\" he\nwrote. \"It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and\nour country, and our fans expect that of us.

We need to move past this\ncontroversy, and we want to do that together with our players.\" The\nkneeling/protesting intensified in late-September after comments from\nPresident Donald Trump in response to Colin Kaepernick's protest of police\nbrutality and inequality. During a campaign rally in Alabama, Trump said,\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects\nour flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's\nfired. He's fired.\" Trump's comments quickly spawned protests in the NFL where\nmany players did not stand for the singing of the national anthem.

Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more\ninformation. [ Earlier today we blogged about the\n](https://www.facebook.com/pg/benniesworc/photos/?ref=page_internal)Uxbridge\nFresh Prince of Bad Hair, who thought it would be wise to shoot a cop car with\na BB gun, and then shoot an autistic man the next day. We couldn't find his\nFacebook page, but within an hour we had a million people pointing us to his\nUxbridge street name - [Tre\nPatterson](https://www.facebook.com/tre.patterson.18): As you can see, we're\ndealing with a real winner here. Turns out this 19 year old is STILL IN HIGH\nSCHOOL!! I shit you not. That's why the two others he was with aren't having\ntheir names released - because they're his minor friends from high school. He\ntells kids in his peer group what things were like \"back in my day.\" This year\nTre, who recently moved here from \"down south,\" and claims to have enrolled at\nUxbridge High School because the coach at UConn told him it would help him get\nrecruited, was suspended multiple times. One of the incidents happened when he\ngot the school put on lock down because he had beef with kids from another\nschool on snapchat, and he claimed he had a gun on snapchat, DURING SCHOOL\nHOURS, and the other kids were coming to UHS with more guns. After being\nuncooperative with the principals AND the cops about it, he was escorted off\nthe premises and suspended. Not expelled- just suspended. Because I'm sure\nwhen he came back he had a newfound thirst for knowledge and a desire to\nfollow school rules. He also was on the basketball and football teams, but\nhardly ever played because his grades weren't good enough. It's hard passing\ncollege prep math when you're only 19 years old. So much for UConn. Here he is\nall dolled up for the first of many junior proms to come for Tre-Tre: Of\ncourse he's the cool kid because he can legally buy booze in Canada and no one\nelse can: Don't worry though, the fam is holding it down on Facebook and has\ngone full free my boi! Apparently his response to the cops after he shot the\nautistic man was that he \"didn't know he had autism.\" Because it's OK to shoot\npeople with BB guns in public as long as they're not autistic. Oh, and\nautistic people all have tattoos on their forehead that let them know they're\nautistic. That's literally the though process of this nudnik. Anyway, this is\nyet another example of the failed educational policies from our state and\nfederal government. This is what happens when administrators value their\ngraduation rates more than the well-being of the entire school - they keep\nshitheads like this in school instead of expelling them. Because it looks\nbetter on a chart if they have less dropouts. Oh, and don't forget that\nschools all have mandates from the federal government, due to Arne Duncan's\nreign of terror, to reduce suspension rates, particularly for students of\ncolor. So now schools like Uxbridge are forced to keep morons like this, who\nobviously have no intention of learning, enrolled in schools. They make it\nimpossible for teachers to do their job and they poison the rest of the\nstudent body with their bullshit. Uxbridge High School lost an entire day of\nlearning because of him. If somehow he graduates this year he'll be 20 when he\ndoes so. And it will only be the result of social promotion, fueled by a\ndesire for better charts.

In October 2017, a rumor\nspread that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- who\nNational Football League teams have refused to sign since his 2016 silent\nprotest during the national anthem -- had said he would be willing to stand\nduring the national anthem if he was signed by a team. Kaepernick was the\nfirst NFL player to sit, and then kneel, during the anthem, in protest against\npolice brutality and racial injustice. The Daily Wire web site\n[wrote](http://archive.is/hgujy): According to a breaking news report from the\nAssociated Press, former San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin\nKaepernick now says that he'll stand during the national anthem if an NFL team\nsuddenly decides to give him a job: BREAKING: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick\ntells CBS he'll stand during national anthem if given chance to play football\nin NFL again. According to CBS News, which sat down with the out-of-work NFLer\nfor \"several hours,\" Kaepernick is actively looking for work, and is willing\nto abdicate his year-long national anthem protest, if only an NFL team would\ndeign to allow him to warm their bench. The sports web site [Bleacher\nReport](http://archive.is/6ci2X) similarly reported: Free-agent quarterback\nColin Kaepernick, who remains unsigned after sitting or kneeling during the\nnational anthem throughout the 2016 season, said he plans to stand if signed\nby an NFL team. Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports revealed Kaepernick's\nintentions Sunday. These reports (and others) were ultimately based on claims\nmade by CBS reporter Jason La Canfora, who has since resiled from these\nclaims. The Daily Wire's story has been updated to reflect that, and the\nAssociated Press has deleted its tweet. However, as of press time, the Daily\nWire's article retained its original, inaccurate headline \"QB Colin Kaepernick\nNow Says He'll Stand for the National Anthem If He's Signed to a Team.\" As of\npress time, the Bleacher Report has not yet updated its story. On 7 October\n2017, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora appeared on the show NFL Today and\nsummarized a conversation he had had with Kaepernick. During that\n[segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c75Sj1_A6I), La Canfora described\nthe player's determination to return to an NFL team, and claimed: He's not\nplanning on kneeling, he's going to donate all his jersey sales, and he's\nplanning on standing for the anthem, if given the opportunity. However, a day\nlater Colin Kaepernick appeared to allude to the inaccuracy of that account,\nin this tweet: A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a\nchance to get its pants on. Kaepernick's girlfriend, radio presenter Nessa\nDiab, directly refuted La Canfora's claims: The reports that Colin will stand\nfor the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone.\n[pic.twitter.com/tWusUBJMeF](https://t.co/tWusUBJMeF) NFL Today deleted a\nvideo of La Canfora's claims from its Twitter account, and La Canfora himself\nposted a series of tweets clarifying that he had not, in fact, discussed the\npossibility of standing for the national anthem in his conversation with\nKaepernick.

What he would do\nduring the Anthem I do not know It was not the first time that a news\norganization reported Kaepernick's purported willingness to stand during the\nanthem. In March 2017, Adam Schefter wrote an\n[article](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18805744/colin-kaepernick-stand-\nnational-anthem-next-season) headlined \"Colin Kaepernick to stand during\nnational anthem next season,\" in which he cited anonymous sources: Quarterback\n[Colin Kaepernick](http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14001/colin-kaepernick)\nwill stand during the national anthem next season, sources told ESPN on\nThursday. Kaepernick no longer wants his method of protest to detract from the\npositive change he believes has been created, sources told ESPN. He also said\nthe amount of national discussion on social inequality -- as well as support\nfrom other athletes nationwide, including NFL and NBA players -- affirmed the\nmessage he was trying to deliver. Schefter did not quote Kaepernick himself in\nthe article or offer verifiable proof. We could not find any evidence to\ncorroborate Schefter's claim.

It's two or three people at the top of\nthe FBI.\" Kallstrom believes the government agency shouldn't have started an\ninvestigation in the first place if it didn't meet certain guidelines. \"If\nthey were not ever going to impanel a grand jury, that means you really don't\nconduct a criminal investigation. You don't have subpoena power, you don't\nhave warrants. That was apparently apparent early on in this investigation. I\nwould've liked to have seen somebody with the integrity not to just conduct an\ninvestigation that doesn't meet any of the criteria of how the FBI operates,\"\nhe stated. He added: \"I suspect that they never had a really bonafide\ninvestigation because the Justice Department wouldn't let them do it.\n\n",

In his room on\nthe 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, he had 23 guns, some of which were\noutfitted with bump stocks (devices which allow semi-automatic weapons the\ncapability to mimic the gunfire of automatic weapons). He killed 58 people and\ninjured 527 before being discovered, killing himself before police could\napprehend him. In the wake of the worst mass shooting in modern United States\nhistory, the [NRA CEO's response to the Las Vegas\nshooting](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/05/nra-wayne-lapierre-\nregulating-guns-mass-shootings-243523) was defiant, belligerent, and utterly\ntone deaf. Romper has reached out to the NRA and is awaiting a reply. NRA CEO\nWayne LaPierre, normally a man who keeps a low profile, offered a rare\ninterview with Fox News on Thursday. While he did call the Las Vegas shooting\nan \"unimaginable tragedy\" during his interview, LaPierre insisted that\n[stricter gun laws](http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/10/05/wayne-\nlapierre-reacts-to-las-vegas-tragedy-bump-stock-issue-vegas-survivor-insists-\non-standing-to-meet-president-trump.html) would not change mass shootings: If\nlegislation worked, Boston massacre wouldn't have worked, San Bernardino where\nCalifornia has every gun law on the books, that wouldn't have happened.\nLaPierre went on to quickly accuse the \"other side\" of the tragedy; notably\nDemocrats and celebrities who have been vehemently calling for gun control\nlegislation. The NRA CEO lashed out and accused them of trying to politicize a\ntragedy, and attempting \"to piggyback their whole agenda to ban guns, restrict\nlaw abiding people for the last 20 years, this circus, on the back of this\ntragedy.\" The CEO became especially agitated when discussing what he believes\nto be the double standard coming out of Hollywood: We spend millions of\ndollars every year, teaching people safety and responsibility, and this\nHollywood crowd makes billions teaching gun irresponsibility to the American\npublic. The hypocrisy is beyond belief. Of course, LaPierre doesn't have\nactual facts to back up those claims, and it's important to remember that he\nis talking about fictional depictions in action movies. When [LaPierre accused\nthose unnamed](https://www.salon.com/2017/10/06/nras-wayne-lapierre-blames-\nhollywood-for-mass-shootings/) \"Hollywood elites\" of \"protecting themselves\nwith guns,\" while supposedly wanting to get rid of guns, he has clearly\nforgotten that few people who have weighed in on stricter gun control have not\ncalled for an outright ban of firearms, according to Salon. His interview with\nFox News' Sean Hannity was terribly off the mark, focused on Hollywood, rather\nthan the \"unimaginable tragedy\" he referenced at first and then appeared to\nquickly forget. Movies in Hollywood do depict deaths, but not actual deaths\ncaused by real guns. Here are a few real-life statistics about gun use in\nAmerica: According to Vox, the United States fares poorly when compared to gun\nviolence in countries of similar socio-economic success. There are six times\nas many homicides by [firearms in the United\nStates](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-\nviolence-statistics-maps-charts)compared to neighboring Canada, and 16 times\nas many as Germany. Americans own nearly half of the [civilian-owned\nfirearms](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/americas/us-gun-\nstatistics/index.html)in the world, according to CNN, 310 million of the 650\nmillion civilian-owned firearms worldwide. [Americans own more\nguns](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-\nwith-guns/) per capita than any other country on the planet, according to a\nPEW Center study. There are more public mass shootings in the United States\nthan any other country in the world, according to the same study by the PEW\nCenter. However badly LaPierre would like to shift the focus from the Las\nVegas shooting victims to his personal vendetta against Hollywood action\nfilms, it can't happen. The reality is, the families of those victims need a\nreal, informed, empathetic response to the mass shooting. Not a distraction.\nBecause they are real people who lost real loved ones at the hands of a man\nwith real guns. This isn't a movie. It's real life.\n\n",

Douglas has [turned to movie news website\nDeadline](http://deadline.com/2018/01/michael-douglas-sexual-harassment-\nallegation-defends-himself-1202239676/) to set the story straight, stating, \"I\nfelt the need to get ahead of this.\" Revealing that The Hollywood Reporter\ncontacted him via his attorney regarding the woman's claims that he used\n\"colourful language\" in front of her, \"spoke raunchily, or dirtily with\nfriends of mine in private conversations on the phone\".

And a legitimate trade publication is going to try and print this\nstory? There is no corroboration, just that they found out somebody else might\nrun the story.\" Douglas calls the whole saga \"extremely painful\", adding, \"I\npride myself on my reputation in this business… I'm bewildered why, after 32\nyears, this is coming out, now. \"The part that hurt the worst is having to\nshare something like this to your wife and your children. My kids are really\nupset, have to go to school worrying this is going to be in some article about\nme, being a sexual harasser. They're scared and very uncomfortable.\" Douglas\nalso states this isn't \"the New Year I had anticipated\", adding he's worried\nthe drama may affect upcoming work he has booked. \"I'm fearful,\" he says. \"I\nhave jobs going with studios who all seem to be supportive at this time.

Sam Wormer, the subject of the story, told us that he was met\nby five men outside his home a night earlier. Two of the five men, he said,\nattacked him directly while the other three \"just kinda hung back,\" but he\ndisputed the story's premise blaming anti-fascist groups: I honestly dont\nthink antifa had anything to do with this. I personally believe this was a\nfalse flag attack perpetrated by the far right to further their own agenda.\nBig League Politics interviewed Wormer after he posted a picture of himself on\nhis Facebook page with a visible cut to his stomach, which he told us came\nfrom a box cutter blade. The caption read: This is social justice apparently.\nThis is what i get for sticking up for someone. Cowards. [ Wormer's attackers\nhave not been identified.

Roy described himself as a white nationalist and supporter of\nPresident Donald Trump to the Free Press. He also\n[said:](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2017/08/15/south-\nburlington-uno-worker-suspended-over-joining-charlottesville-rally/570201001/)\nObviously I would advocate for racial separation and racial nationalism or\nrepatriation or even a return to -- our country was a white country up until\nthe 1965 Hart-Celler Immigration Act.

According to Wormer, he was \"completely shocked\" to see\nRoy in a Vice News [report](https://news.vice.com/story/vice-news-tonight-\nfull-episode-charlottesville-race-and-terror) about the rally and did not\nagree with his beliefs, but still opposed subsequent demands online for him to\nbe fired or lose custody of his child. Taking away somebody's job and\nlivelihood -- I mean, that's just adding fuel to the fire. I don't think any\ngood is going to come of this on anybody's side. He said that he was attacked\nshortly after he made a separate comment about Roy on Facebook, which read: I\nbelieve he's doing what he truly believes is right, and despite all the anger\nand hate pointed his way right now he stands by his choices. There's a lot to\nbe said for that. I respect him for that, and I won't stand with those people\nwho are trying to have Ryan's child taken away or have him fired. I can't, he\nand his family have done too much for me. Sorry but my allegiance is with Ryan\nno matter his choice, even if I can't agree with him. You can hate me for it,\nbut I stand with my decision and if any violence comes his way I will stand\nwith him. I don't agree with his actions but he has stuck up for me and other\nmarginalized people when nobody else would. That is what family does. Wormer\nsaid besides the attack on him, his roommate and his roommate's mother also\nreceived death threats, including \"a threatening call\". Wormer also told us\nthat Roy contacted him after the attack: He and his mother both reached out to\nme and made sure I was okay and safe, and thanked me for standing up for him.\nPolice in Essex Junction, where Wormer lives, told us they have \"nothing\ncurrently to report\" on the matter.

He pulled the car over, but the driver quickly took off\nagain…only to crash into a fire hydrant. Dash cam footage from Ferguson's\npatrol car then shows the drunk driver exiting his vehicle. He stood there\nhunched over with his hands behind his back, until Ferguson began approaching.\nThat's when the driver pulled out a pistol. Rather than brandishing his own\nweapon, Ferguson wrestled the gun out of the driver's hands - and the driver\nto the ground where he was finally handcuffed. At his hearing in August, the\nsuspect pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and battery on a law enforcement\nofficer, as well as driving under the influence. After serving 170 days of his\nsentence, he was placed on probation. But according to Picerno, his lawyer, he\nshould just be thankful he's alive. \"He is very lucky and both he and his\nfamily are very grateful for the officer, Sgt.

Following Tuesday night's primary in\nIndiana, the GOP front-runner was named the presumptive nominee after Texas\nSenator Ted Cruz announced that he was suspending his campaign. \"Donald Trump\nwill be presumptive GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating\n@HillaryClinton #NeverClinton,\" Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus\ntweeted. Although, Trump and Cruz were far from cordial opponents throughout\nthe race, the billionaire businessman said what Cruz did was a \"brave thing to\ndo because we want to bring unity.\" While Cruz revealed he was leaving the\nrace as there no longer seemed to be a \"viable\" path to the White House, Ohio\nGovernor John Kasich has not announced the end of his campaign. However, even\nwith Kasich still in the race, Trump sits in a comfortable position to\nofficially take the nomination if he secures the required 1,237 delegates\nneeded to win his party. \"Tonight's results are not going to alter Gov.\nKasich's campaign plans,\" Kasich's chief strategist John Weaver said,\naccording to [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/03/politics/indiana-primary-\nhighlights/). \"Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves\nwinning the nomination at an open convention.\" While Kasich's camp continues\nto be optimistic, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign - which also\ntook a blow to her campaign when Senator Bernie Sanders won Indiana - released\na statement, condemning the announcement that Trump is the Republican party's\npresumptive nominee. \"Fundamentally, our next president will need to do two\nthings: keep our nation safe in a dangerous world and help working families\nget ahead here at home,\" the statement, obtained by PEOPLE, read. \"Donald\nTrump is not prepared to do either. Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has\ndemonstrated that he's too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our\nnation and the free world. \"With so much as stake, Donald Trump is simply too\nbig of a risk. Hillary Clinton has proven that she has the strength to keep us\nsafe in an uncertain world and a lifelong record of fighting to break down the\nbarriers - economic and social - that hold working families back. While Donald\nTrump seeks to bully and divide Americans, Hillary Clinton will unite us to\ncreate an economy that works for everyone.\" While Trump ignored any criticism,\nsaying during his victory speech at Trump tower, \"We're going to win in\nNovember\", he faced backlash from another opponent in the form anti-Trump adds\nthat the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has released in an accelerated\ncampaign against Trump. According to a press release from the PCCC, the ads\nwill highlight Trump's \"hate-mongering, his disrespect for women, and his\nbelief that American wages are 'too high'.\" \"We have already begun running ads\nacross the nation hitting Donald Trump - defining him early and moving the\ndebate to our turf. This is key to winning.\" WATCH: Voters React to Ted Cruz\nDropping Out of the Presidential Race Other opponents of the real estate mogul\nquickly vocalized their opinions, including former adviser to Jeb Bush Tim\nMiller who currently serves as the spokesman for an anti-Trump super-PAC, Our\nPrinciples PAC. \"Never ever, ever Trump.

            "input": "A lot of Californians are mad as hell. Some even say they're not going to take\nit anymore. \"It\" is the result of November's presidential election. What these\nCalifornians are doing is organizing a secessionist movement -- as in, taking\nCalifornia out of the United States. Their movement is called Calexit, as in\nBrexit. Their inspiration is the growing gulf that separates them --\npolitically, culturally, demographically -- from the rest of the union.\nHillary Clinton outpolled Donald Trump by a two-to-one margin here. \"Without\nCalifornia, Trump would have won the popular vote,\" tweeted conservative\npundit and Trump critic David Frum. The Golden State has a population of 39\nmillion people, more than any other state in the union, and more people than\nin all of Canada. Metro Los Angeles alone is home to close to 19 million, a\ntotal greater than Ontario and Alberta combined. As Frum points out, those are\nnumbers that come with economic clout, and therein lies the rub for many\nCalifornians. The U.S. without California, he writes, would be the world's\nsecond-ranked technology power instead of the first. It's home to Silicon\nValley and companies such as Google, Apple, Cisco, Intel, Oracle, and SpaceX.\nCalifornia boasts the world's sixth largest economy, greater than France,\nItaly, South Korea and India. California is also culturally distinct from much\nof the rest of the U.S. It's synonymous with liberal causes, from\nenvironmental protection to gun control to health care, and that has other\nAmericans judging Californians, and not in a flattering way. It's a reality\nnot lost on Marcus Ruiz Evans, one of the movers and shakers behind Calexit.\n\"California,\" he admitted to the Washington Post, \"(is) seen as weird.\" That\nweirdness extends to politics beyond the presidential variety. Gov. Jerry\nBrown has vowed to ensure Californians have health insurance coverage, offered\nthrough the state-run health exchange called Covered California, even if Trump\nRepublicans repeal ObamaCare. But where the state most hears a different\ndrummer is on immigration. Californians are decidedly in favour of it, and\nit's easy to see why. California has the largest immigrant population in the\nunion, approximately 10 million in total, a quarter of those undocumented. If\nyou're not an immigrant in California, you know one. Or two. Or more. In\nresponse to Trump's ambitions to engage in large-scale deportation of illegal\nimmigrants, the state legislature is considering a bill that would declare the\nstate a \"sanctuary.\" Lawmakers have even hired former Obama attorney general\nEric Holder to battle the Trump administration on the issue. That step earned\nthe enmity of the new president. \"Trump claims California is 'out of control,'\n\" writes columnist George Skelton in the Los Angeles Times, though the irony\nis undoubtedly lost on the president. Trump has threatened to cut off federal\nfunds to California. \"We'll defund,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We give tremendous\namounts of money to California.\" The problem is that, like residents of\nCanada's \"have\" provinces, Californians contribute more money to the federal\ntreasury than what comes back. There has been much grousing about the Trump\nadministration ever since the threats were levelled, fertile ground for\nCalexit. The secessionists even have the support of Silicon Valley\nbillionaires Peter Thiel and Shervin Pishevar. Companies like Google have\nexpressed concern about their ability in an anti-immigrant climate to recruit\nforeigners for jobs not enough Americans are qualified to fill. In January,\nthe group Yes California was given permission to circulate a petition with the\nintention of putting the sovereignty question on the 2018 ballot. If the\npetition is successful -- close to 600,000 signatures are required -- a\nspecial vote to decide the state's future would follow in 2019. Calexit does\nhave its skeptics. \"Canadians know you don't escape the shadow of your giant\nneighbour by drawing a border,\" wrote Prof. Timothy William Waters in the Los\nAngeles Times. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he believes secession is a\nbad idea. Such opinions are far from universal. According to a new\nReuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken in California, one-third of respondents\nsupport \"peaceful withdrawal from the union.\" As one tweeter wrote: \"We'll\njust take our avocados and legal weed and go.\" Terry McConnell is a former\nEdmonton Journal columnist, editorial writer and copy editor now living in\nCalifornia\n\n",

As the FS1 Dynamic Duo began discussing the topic, Sharpe went\non an incredible eight-minute rant on how NFL owners suddenly got an awakening\nabout President Trump's comments at an Alabama rally about players who kneel\nduring the national anthem. Sharpe first said he was \"disappointed and …\nunimpressed,\" about the whole thing. And then he expressed why he was\ndisappointed and unimpressed: \"I'm disappointed, Skip and Joy, because this is\nthe tipping point. Of the 7,537 things that President Trump has said in the\nlast 50 years, him calling an NFL player a 'SOB' is what brought the NFL, the\nowners and players together. And while some might be moved by the conscience\nof these NFL owners, it wasn't their conscience that moved them. It was the\ncash. Because see Skip, what we know about people with money, they don't like\nto be told what to do…they don't like being bullied. You see, President Trump\nhas bullied a lot of people …\" Sharpe then mentioned Trump's comments on\nMexico, attacking a Gold Star family after last year's Democratic National\nConvention, and his statements to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush\nabout women saying, \"that did not shock the conscience of NFL owners.\" And he\nalso pointed out a number of owners, including Jerry Jones, Daniel Snyder,\nShad Khan, and Robert Kraft, who contributed to Trump's inauguration. \"Now I'm\nunimpressed because this wasn't a protest. This was unity. So what are we\nshowing solidarity against, Skip? We're showing solidarity because President\nTrump .. he challenged the very men … wealthy, wealthy men … billionaires and\nhe told them what you should do if someone protests, you should fire them.\nThey don't like being told what to do, Skip. \"And then, Skip, he called\nplayers that protested the anthem … he called them 'SOB's.' Think about that\nnow, he called them 'SOB's.' That's what got the owners, that's what got the\nplayers to unite. \"Is that the worst that he's ever said? Absolutely not.\nNever called Vladimir Putin an 'SOB,' Never called (Erdogan) of Turkey an\n'SOB,' even those men that walked down the streets in Charlottesville,\nVirginia … he never said 'SOB' …\" This was an impassioned Sharpe. He also\npointed out Colin Kaepernick, who started the kneeling during the national\nanthem, was forgotten and the NFL owners were uniting against Donald Trump.\n\"It wasn't until he came for the NFL that their conscience was shocked!\"\nSharpe said of all the teams that issued statements this weekend, only the\nSeattle Seahawks got the reason why they were denouncing the President's\nstatements. And he also set his sights on fellow FS1 analyst Ray Lewis for\npreviously criticizing Kaepernick and [then kneeling on the sideline with the\nBaltimore Ravens](http://thecomeback.com/nfl/ray-lewis-switched-sides-to-\nkneel-for-the-anthem-in-london-and-people-werent-thrilled-about-it.html) in\nLondon on Sunday. Sharpe said he was \"very disappointed\" in him, saying Lewis\n\"sat in that chair right there saying that he could never kneel, never not\nstand for the national anthem\" citing those who died fighting for the flag and\nthen he went down on both knees. \"What are you kneeling for?\" It was one of\nthe more emotional segments on Undisputed in its brief history.\n\n",

The show documents Ms Freeman's experiences in\nManchester in the week after a terror attack at the city's arena that killed\n22 people. Described as an attempt to challenge stereotypes, the show aimed to\ngive the the 44-year-old a \"chance to meaningfully walk in the shoes of\nsomeone from a different background.\" Katie Freeman starred in the documentary\n(Channel 4) However, when a trailer for the show aired on Tuesday, viewers\ntook to social media to slam the nature of Ms Freeman's disguise. One wrote:\n\"What the f*** is this? Channel 4 has totally missed the mark here. Who on\nearth thought it would be a good idea to put prosthetics on somebody to make\nthem a caricature of people of a different race (as if being white and Muslim\nare exclusive anyway)?

Madness.\" Another bemused\ncommenter simply wrote: \"Did they...brownface her?\" On Twitter, viewer Alice\nBeggs said: \"Just saw Channel 4 have a show called 'My Week As A Muslim' where\nthis white woman has brownface and prosthetics so she can learn about racism\netc. Because god forbid we just listen to Muslims when they tell us what abuse\nthey get.\" Another criticised Channel 4 for not \"actually following a Muslim\npoc (person of colour) and documenting their life, instead of doing this\".\nBefore Ms Freeman underwent the transformation, she admitted she would avoid\nsitting next to a Muslim on public transport because \"you see them and think\nthey're going to blow something up\", [the Daily\nMail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4991044/Channel-4-slammed-\nblacking-woman-new-show.html) reported.

The assailant opened fire\nwith a fully automatic weapon just as Jason Aldean was beginning his show at\nthe Route 91 Harvest Festival.  Videos posted on social media show Aldean, one\nof the biggest names in the genre, singing as very rapid gunfire begins in the\nbackground. He can be seen running from stage as he, and the thousands in the\ncrowd who came to see him, realized the horror of what was happening. No\nmatter how often these tragedies occur (and it is far too often), one never\ngoes into an event thinking it will happen then or there. The terror is\nunimaginable. In this case, it was also protracted. A [gunman continued to\nrain bullets](http://people.com/crime/active-shooter-reported-near-las-vegas-\ncasino-hotel-during-country-music-festival/) on the audience for up to two\nterrifying hours, reports indicate. Victims ran to safety, according to NBC\nNews, during momentary breaks in the violence, at which point the shooter\npresumably reloaded.  Many were trapped in the venue for what must have felt\nlike an eternity, but police SWAT officers eventually found and killed the\nshooter. He was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas\nMetropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said, and shot dead. \"Right now we\nbelieve it's a solo act, a lone wolf attacker,\" Lombardo told reporters. \"We\nare pretty confident there is no longer a threat.\" The gunman has not yet been\nidentified. Aldean said he was safe in an Instagram post early Monday, sharing\nan image of the city and asking for prayers for the victims: \"Tonight has been\nbeyond horrific. I still dont know what to say but wanted to let everyone know\nthat Me and my Crew are safe.\"  \"My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone\ninvolved tonight,\" he wrote, clearly as stunned and traumatized as anyone\nelse. \"It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming\nout to enjoy what should have been a fun night.\" Aldean's wife Brittany Kerr\nposted her own message on Instagram, saying, \"We are safe… our angels were\ndefinitely watching over us tonight.\" \"No words for what happened,\" she added.\n\"Just horrific. Praying for everyone.\" Witness accounts are what you would\nexpect - unable to fully do justice to what happened as you read this, but\nterrifying nonetheless. Country star Jake Owen was one of the witnesses,\nhaving just finished his set and was still on stage when the shooting started.\n\"I was crouched down behind a cop car,\" he said. \"There was blood on people\nand you could see a couple of people in the streets that looked like they had\nbeen shot,\" Owen added. Ivetta Saldana told the Las Vegas Review-Journal, \"It\nwas was a horror show. People were standing around, then they hit the floor.\"\nRobyn Webb, who was at the concert along with her husband last night, told the\nnewspaper, \"It just kept coming. It was relentless.\" Authorities, meanwhile,\nare searching for a 62-year-old woman named Marylou Danley, whom they believe\nis the gunman's roommate. Police have searched a home in Mesquite, Nevada, 85\nmiles from Las Vegas, where it is believed the gunman lived with Danley. She\nis considered a person of interest in the case.  UPDATE: Police have\nidentified the assailant as Stephen Paddock, 64. He is shown above with his\ncompanion, Danley. Paddock is believed to have begun his attack around 10:00\npm local time and to have continued shooting for two hours. Police were\nreportedly able to locate Paddock quickly due to the smoke from his weapon\nsetting off hotel fire detectors. Paddock's motives for the shooting remain\nunclear. Early reports indicate that he was not a member of any militant\ngroup. He was not known to hold extremist political or religious beliefs,\nthough the investigation into the matter is just hours old. Danley was\napprehended for questioning at 3:40 a.m.  It is not currently known if she's\nbeing treated as an accomplice in the attack, or whether law enforcement\nsimply wants to learn more. In any case, reports indicate that several guns,\nincluding at least eight rifles, were found in the room rented by Paddock and\nDanley. \"We have no idea what his belief system was,\" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo\nsaid during his press briefing early this morning. More details to follow as\nthis shocking story develops ... UPDATE: The death toll is now 58 and\nclimbing, according to an ABC News report, with more than 518 people wounded.\nExpect that to tragically rise as the day progresses.\n\n",

An\nAlabama lawmaker introduced a bill Monday that would require certain sex\noffenders to be permanently and physically castrated prior to being released\nfrom prison. The offenders that the bill targets are the worst of the worst --\npredators of young children. Republican Rep. Steve Hurst introduced the\nmeasure requiring anyone older than 21 who is convicted of \"certain sex\noffenses\" against children age 12 or younger to pay for the surgical procedure\nbefore they serve the end of their prison sentence. This isn't a first for\nHurst -- he's introduced similar legislation seven times since 2006, but most\nof his efforts never made it out of committee, according to CBS News. He was\nprompted to begin this crusade as the result of a visit from a foster parent\nadvocacy group that relayed a \"horrible\" story of abuse. \"I've often wondered\nwhat that child went through, physically and mentally, and what kind of shape\nhe's in now,\" Hurst said Monday. \"They (sex offenders) have marked these\nchildren for life. They will never get over it. And if they've marked children\nfor life, they need to be marked for life.\" CBS News reported: Hurst in 2005\nagreed to remove castration requirements from legislation setting tougher\nsentences for sex offenders. Several House members at the time told The\nAssociated Press they feared the castration language would have made the bill\nunconstitutional. In 2011, Hurst co-sponsored a bill that classified the\nsexual abuse of a child 6 years or younger as a capital offense, allowing\ncourts to sentence offenders to life without parole. Alabama residents have\nmixed feelings about the measure. \"Somebody that wants to mess with a little\ngirl or little boy that age should be castrated, and they should not be able\nto mess with any other kids,\" Keith Dison told CBS affiliate WIAT. \"I\nunderstand prison and going to prison for a long time for some kind of crime\nlike that, but to physical mutilate someone…that's a little out there…it's\ncrazy,\" Jessica George told the station.

In\na hastily arranged press conference Friday night, Clinton said it was\n\"imperative\" for the FBI to \"explain this issue ... without delay.\" Clinton\nsaid she is \"confident\" the conclusion reached in July about her emails will\nnot change and downplayed its potential effect on the election. \"I think\npeople a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,\" she said. The\nnew emails -- which potentially number in the thousands -- came from a laptop\nthat had been shared by top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her now-estranged\nhusband, Anthony Weiner, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reported. Asked if Abedin had\nshared with her what might have been discovered, Clinton said she had no\ninformation and \"we don't know what to believe.\" \"We've heard these rumors, we\ndon't know what to believe, and I'm sure there are going to be even more\nrumors, which is why it is incumbent on the FBI to tell us what is going on,\"\nClinton said. \"Right now, you're guess is as good as mine, and that's not good\nenough.\" Clinton's campaign said it had no advance knowledge of Comey's\nletter, and the campaign staff found out about it only after the news had\nbroken Friday afternoon, while Clinton was on a two-hour,15-minute flight\ntraveling with staff and with reporters to Cedar Rapids, all of whom had\nlittle or no Wi-Fi access for most of the duration of the flight Reporters\nshouted questions to Clinton as she walked from the plane in Cedar Rapids to\nthe car that took her to her rally. She just smiled and waved, ignoring the\nquestions. House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah,\nannounced the FBI's discovery of the emails. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The\nFBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the\ninvestigation.\" Case reopened-- Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) [October 28,\n2016](https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/792047597040971776) Pegues\nconfirmed Friday that the new batch of emails was discovered during the\ninvestigation into the August sexting scandal of Anthony Weiner, the husband\nof top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, after the agency seized electronic devices\nbelonging to the couple. Weiner was alleged to be exchanging sexually explicit\nmessages with a 15-year-old girl. Comey's letter to Congress informed\nlawmakers that he was supplementing his previous testimony on the matter of\nthe investigation, which was completed in July. At the time, Comey recommended\nno charges against Hillary Clinton, which was accepted by the Justice\nDepartment. Following the release of the FBI letter, House Speaker Paul Ryan\nreiterated his call for the Director of National Intelligence to stop giving\nclassified briefings to Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. \"This\ndecision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email\nserver, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,\" Ryan\nsaid in a statement. \"I renew my call for the Director of National\nIntelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until\nthis matter is fully resolved.\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said\nFriday that the Department is trying to figure out what these emails pertain\nto and whether they're relevant to Clinton's time as secretary of state. Toner\nsaid they can't make any assumptions that they are, \"but they may be.\" If so,\nToner said the State Department is ready to cooperate with the FBI, but as of\nFriday afternoon, the department had not been contacted by the agency. Donald\nTrump weighed in on the news at a Friday rally in Manchester, New Hampshire,\nsaying that \"perhaps justice will be done\" after the FBI takes further\ninvestigative steps on the emails. The audience roared, \"Lock her up! Lock her\nup,\" as Trump declared, \"Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have\nnever seen before...We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval\nOffice.\" Trump also commended the FBI for now being \"willing to have the\ncourage to right the horrible mistake that they made\" in announcing its\ninvestigation was complete. \"This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the\nAmerican people fully understood and it is everybody's hope that it is about\nto be corrected,\" he said. Later, Trump said of the \"system\" he has claimed to\nbe \"rigged\" for several weeks: \"It might be not be as rigged as I thought. I\nthink they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right\nthis yet.\" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, called on Comey in a\nstatement to \"immediately provide the American public more information than is\ncontained in the letter\" sent to Senate and House committee chairmen.\n\"Director Comey's letter refers to emails that have come to light in an\nunrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director\nhimself notes they may not even be significant,\" Podesta wrote Friday\nafternoon. \"The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide\nthe full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not\nproduce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.\" He\nadded that, in the months since the email investigation was completed,\npartisan efforts have continued to undermine the agency. \"Donald Trump and his\nRepublican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both\npublic and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their\nconclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential\ncampaign,\" Podesta said. The timing of the revelation has angered some former\nDepartment of Justice employees. Former spokesman Matthew Miller called the\ndisclosure \"inappropriate\" on Twitter and suggested that Comey had broken a\ncardinal rule: But today's disclosure might be worst abuse yet.

The next\npresident will face countless challenges on day one. Among the biggest is the\nongoing civil war in Syria. Margaret Brennan spoke with Leon Panetta -- a\nformer CIA director, defense secretary, and White House chief of staff --\nabout the road ahead for U.S. involvement in the war-torn nation. LEON\nPANETTA: Inaction is not an option in Syria because if you stand back, the\nsituation is gonna get worse. Look, the best-case scenario would be to have\nAssad step down, to have a transitional government be able to establish itself\nrepresenting each of the factions that are there -- the Sunnis, the Kurds, the\nShias. And then, frankly, have the Russians and whatever is left of the Syrian\nforces join with the United States in going after ISIS to truly defeat them.\nThat would be the best-case scenario. MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the odds of\nthat? PANETTA: Not very good. Not very good. BRENNAN: What's the worst-case\nscenario? PANETTA: The worst-case scenario is that Assad continues to remain\nin power, continues to kill Syrians. That refugees continue to flow out of\nSyria, that the Russians continue to have a presence there and continue to\nattack our moderate forces that we're trying to train in Syria. And that ISIS\nthen uses that and creates an even bigger base from which to conduct attacks\nagainst this country. That's the worst-case scenario. BRENNAN: Sounds like\nyou're describing what's happening now. PANETTA: It is what's happening now.\nAnd it's what can continue to happen in the future if we don't deal with it.\nBRENNAN: There are around 300 special operators in Syria right now. Will the\nnext president have to commit more American boots on the ground? PANETTA: I\nthink the likelihood is that the next president is gonna have to consider\nadding additional special forces on the ground to try to assist those moderate\nforces that are taking on ISIS, and that are taking on Assad's forces. And we\nhave to increase our air strikes. We've got to do all of those things in order\nto put increasing pressure on ISIS but also on Assad. We can't surrender one\nobjective for the other. We've gotta continue to press on both fronts.\nBRENNAN: Is it possible to defeat ISIS without challenging Assad? PANETTA: I\nthink it's very difficult as we've seen to conduct effective operations\nagainst ISIS when we're dealing with Assad's forces pressing us in different\nplaces. And when we're dealing with the Russians who go in and literally bomb\nthe very forces that we're training to go after Assad and to go after ISIS. We\ncannot have that situation continue in the future. Protect our forces there.\nBRENNAN: So the U.S. has to confront Russia? PANETTA: We are hoping upon hope\nthat the Russians will do the right thing. They're not gonna do the right\nthing without pressure. They're not gonna do the right thing without giving\nour diplomats greater leverage than what they have now to deal with the\nRussians. To do that we have got to make very clear that we have objectives to\nachieve, that we intend to press to achieve those objectives, and that we will\nnot allow them to divert us from the goals of defending ourselves. Here's\nwhere the candidates stand: Hillary Clinton wants to increase airstrikes\nagainst ISIS. She said she would arm the moderate rebels, and pressure Russia\nto get out of Syria. We should add that Panetta is advising the Clinton\ncampaign. Donald Trump has announced he'd declare war on ISIS, and he wouldn't\nrule out more U.S. troops on the ground -- although he offered few details.\n\n",

At the top of that list is the protracted crisis in Syria, where\nmore than 250,000 people have died, according to UN reports, and some 12\nmillion have been forced from their homes. Correspondent Steve Kroft asks\nPresident Obama about the lack of progress in Syria, but Obama says\nimprovement takes time. \"In a situation that is as volatile and with as many\nplayers as there are inside of Syria, there aren't any silver bullets,\" he\nsays. One of those players, Kroft points out, is Russia, which recently\nstepped up airstrikes and naval bombardments in support of Syrian President\nBashar al-Assad. President Putin \"is challenging your leadership, Mr.\nPresident,\" Kroft says. Obama disagrees. \"Steve, I've got to tell you, if you\nthink that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in\nin order to prop up your only ally, is leadership, then we've got a different\ndefinition of leadership,\" he says. Kroft and Obama discuss domestic issues as\nwell, including gun violence. At a [press\nconference](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/01/statement-\npresident-shootings-umpqua-community-college-roseburg-oregon) after last\nweek's mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama urged the country to do more\nto prevent these tragedies. In the unaired clip below, Kroft asks the\npresident if he can personally make a difference. Obama acknowledges that his\noptions are limited. \"We are running out of administrative actions that could\nreally move the needle in reducing gun violence in this country,\" he says. At\nthe same time, he adds, \"it is not realistic to think that this Congress will\npass any common sense gun safety legislation.\" But that doesn't mean a public\noutcry can't effect change, Obama says. \"The most important thing I can do\nright now is just to keep on lifting up the issue and saying, 'It doesn't have\nto be this way,'\" he tells Kroft. \"I genuinely believe that.\" The two-part\ninterview also touches on the 2016 presidential race, and the candidates on\nboth sides of the aisle. Kroft asks the president what he thinks of GOP\nfrontrunner Donald Trump. \"He is, you know, the classic reality TV character,\"\nObama says. \"At these early stages, it's not surprising that he's gotten a lot\nof attention.\" As to whether that attention will evaporate, the president\ndeclines to speculate. \"I'll leave it up to the pundits to make that\ndetermination,\" Obama says. \"I don't think he'll end up being president of the\nUnited States.\" At different moments in the interview, the president turns\nreflective, taking stock of his time in office and eyeing the year ahead. In\nthe unaired clip below, he tells Kroft that, at this point, he's learned to\ntrust his instincts. \"The nice thing about being a veteran in anything is your\nfear kind of goes away,\" he says. \"There's no doubt I'm better at this job now\nthan I was when I started.\" At the end of the interview, Kroft asks Obama if\nhe's glad he can't run for president again. Obama says he feels a mixture of\nsatisfaction at what he's accomplished and a desire to still do more. \"But by\nthe time I'm finished, I think it will be time for me to go,\" he says, adding\nthat new blood in the White House is essential for a healthy democracy. \"Do\nyou think if you ran again, could run again, and did run again, you would be\nelected?\" Kroft asks. \"Yes,\" says Obama, without missing a beat.\n\n",

At least seven people were killed and 35\nothers injured in the twin assaults, the semi-official Fars agency reported.\nThe attacks were the most audacious State media reported that gunmen stormed\nthe parliament building in Tehran and went on a shooting spree. At least one\nattacker detonated a suicide bomb. Five people died and at least 25 were\ninjured there, Fars reported. At the same time, a gun and suicide bomb attack\ntargeted the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum on the southern outskirts of the\nIranian capital. Two people died and 10 were injured at the shrine, Fars said.\nA woman was arrested after the attack at the tomb, Fars reported, adding that\nanother attacker has been surrounded by security officers. CNN has not\nindependently verified the number of victims and it was not immediately clear\nwhether the number of dead included the suicide bombers. The attackers were\nholding a number of hostages inside the highly-fortified parliament building,\nPress TV reported, as Iranian officials scrambled to establish who was behind\nthe attacks or whether they were coordinated. A picture from semi-official\nFars news agency shows a man lowering a young boy from a window of the\nparliament building onto the street as another man holding a gun watches over\nthem from another window. The man with the gun is reportedly a policeman\nhelping with the evacuation. Attacks of this nature are extremely rare in\nIran, particularly in the highly-controlled capital where tourist and\ngovernment sites are tightly policed. Gun ownership is heavily controlled in\nIran, raising speculation that the attackers' guns were smuggled into the\ncountry. Symbolic attack Iran's parliament, also called the Islamic\nConsultative Assembly or Majlis, has 290 members. It has female members and\nhas representatives for religious minorities including Christians,\nZoroastrians and Jews. It is currently unclear how the attacker or attackers\nentered the parliament building, which has multiple security checkpoints. The\nlocation of the mausoleum attack is symbolic, targeting the tomb of the\nIslamic Republic's founder and first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah\nKhomeini. He led the revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979 and was Iran's\nleader for 10 years. The mausoleum is located around 25 kilometers (15 miles)\nfrom the parliament. Attacks rare Such attacks in Iran are rare, but the\ncountry -- with its largely Shiite population -- has been involved in military\nactions against Sunni terrorist groups such as ISIS, who regard Shiites as\napostates. Last year, Iran's government said it thwarted \"one of the biggest\nplots\" by terror groups targeting Tehran and other major cities during the\nmonth of Ramadan. This year's holy month started almost two weeks ago on May\n26. The last major attack in Iran was in 2010 when a Sunni extremist group\ncarried out a suicide attack against a mosque in Sistan-Baluchistan killing 39\npeople. Kurdish groups have carried out small scale attacks against Iranian\nsecurity forces in the north-west of the country. Print this article Back to\nTop\n\n",

University\nadministrator Nicole Eramo is seeking $7.5 million from the magazine over its\nportrayal of her in the 2014 story by Sabrina Rubin Erdely about the alleged\nsexual assault of a woman identified only as \"Jackie.\" Eramo claims she was\nunfairly portrayed in the article as trying to sweep Jackie's sexual assault\nunder the rug in order to protect the university. Attorney Tom Clare argued\nTuesday that Erdely set out from the beginning to tell a story of\n\"institutional indifference,\" brushed off statements from her sources that\ndidn't fit that narrative and pushed her own views about the administration\nonto the vulnerable women she was interviewing. \"Once they decided what the\narticle was going to be about, it didn't matter what the facts were,\" Clare\nsaid. The story about Jackie's rape set off a firestorm at the University of\nVirginia and in schools nationwide and prompted police to launch an\ninvestigation into the alleged assault. Eramo received hundreds of angry\nletters and emails and faced protesters outside her office. The story crumbled\nafter other news outlets began asking questions and police found no evidence\nto back up Jackie's claims. The article was officially retracted in April\n2015. Eramo must prove that Rolling Stone statements about her made her appear\n\"odious, infamous or ridiculous\" and that the magazine acted with \"actual\nmalice,\" meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or\nshould have known it was false. A lawyer for Rolling Stone, Scott Sexton, said\nin closing statements there is no evidence the magazine knew a botched story\nabout a gang rape at the University of Virginia was false before publishing\nit. While the women Erdely interviewed - including Jackie - told her that\nEramo was their fiercest advocate, Clare argued that Erdely was so invested in\nher preconceived storyline that she was \"blind to the facts.\" He argued that\nErdely purposely set out to make Eramo the \"villain\" because she knew she was\nan \"easy target\" and couldn't speak publicly about Jackie's case due to\nfederal privacy laws. \"It's reckless, it's cavalier and it's intentional,\"\nClare said. Over the course of the more than two-week trial, the 10 jurors\nhave watched 11 hours of video testimony, heard from a dozen live witnesses\nand have examined nearly 300 exhibits. Seven jurors will deliberate and three\nwill be named as alternates. (C) 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights\nReserved.

Two weeks ago, the U.S. intelligence\ncommunity announced it is \"confident that the Russian government directed the\nrecent compromises of e-mails.\" The candidates also challenged on a number of\nother issues throughout the debate. On the issue of immigration, Trump said\nClinton agreed with his signature proposal. \"Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.\nHillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006,\" Trump said. \"I voted for border\nsecurity, and there are...\" Clinton began speaking, before Trump interrupted,\n\"And the wall.\" We rate Trump's claim as partially true. As a senator, Clinton\ndid vote for a bill to build 700 miles of fencing along parts of the\n2,000-mile Southern border, but not a massive wall as Trump has proposed.\nTrump accused Clinton Wednesday night of hiring people to disrupt his allies.\n\"She's the one, and Obama, that caused the violence,\" Trump said. The truth on\nthat score is unclear. Democratic contractors were caught on video, appearing\nto plan to provoke Trump supporters. But there's no indication Clinton's\ncampaign paid for it or even knew about it. As in previous debates, Trump\ndenied making some controversial comments that are immortalized on video. \"He\nsaid that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because\nthey were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted,\" Clinton said. \"I\ndid not say that. I did not say that,\" Trump said. But in Greensboro, North\nCarolina, Trump told a crowd, \"Believe me. She would not be my first choice.\nThat I can tell you.\" \"He also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and\nmimicked him on national television,\" Clinton said. \"Wrong,\" Trump denied. But\nhe did that too, at a campaign rally at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. \"I don't\nremember!' He's going like, 'I don't remember!'\" Trump said, imitating his\nphysical handicap. On the budget, Clinton claimed that her proposals on\ninfrastructure and education would not add a penny to the debt because she has\nways to pay for all of them. Independent analysts said that's false -- her\nplan add $200 billion to the debt over the next decade. Trump's plans, they\nsaid, would add $5.3 trillion.\n\n",

Although Allah allows a husband to beat\nhis wife, there is no provision in the Qur'an for a wife to beat her husband.\nNor can she initiate a divorce. Only men can do so, and with relative ease. In\n\"Heretic,\" Ayaan Hirsi Ali explains the shackles of sharia for women,\nincluding \"the right of men to have unfettered sexual access to their wives,\nthe right of men to practice polygamy, and the restriction of women's legal\nrights in divorce cases, in estate law, in cases of rape, in court testimony,\nand in consent to marriage.\" According to Sharia, women (and little girls) who\nare captives of war can be raped by their Muslim captors. But girls who have\nsex outside of marriage are flogged, and women who commit adultery are stoned.\nTwo incidents almost 14 centuries apart show just how deeply the exploitation\nof women is ingrained In Sharia. In August 2014, after Muslim fighters\ncaptured Yazidi villages in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq, they executed\nthe men and adolescent boys by spraying them with automatic-weapons fire. What\nhappened to women and children might truly have been worse. As chronicled in\nthe Islamic State on-line magazine \"Dabiq,\" \"After capture, the Yazidi women\nand children were then divided according to the Sharī'ah amongst the fighters\nof the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar operations, after one\nfifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State's authority to be\ndivided.\" Captives were sent \"to Syria or to other locations inside Iraq,\nwhere they were bought and sold for sex.\" According to a report in The New\nYork Times, one of the captives, a 12-year-old Yazidi child, was raped by a\ndevout Muslim fighter who \"took the time to explain that what he was about to\ndo was not a sin. Because the preteen girl practiced a religion other than\nIslam, the Quran not only gave him the right to rape her - it condoned and\nencouraged it.\" Sadly, the victim was just one of countless thousands in the\nhistory of Islam. In 627, Muhammad and his fighters invaded the villages of\nthe prosperous Banu Mustaliq Jewish tribe on the shores of the Red Sea. As\nwith the Yazidis, the Jewish men and boys murdered by Muhammad and his Muslim\nhordes were spared the unthinkable atrocities their loved ones were about to\nsuffer. In accordance with the law of Allah, many were raped, others sold as\nchattel. Muhammad, revered by Muslims the world over as the founder of their\nreligion, took a Jewish woman as booty after having her husband and hundreds\nmore men beheaded. Then he forced her on his bed and added her to his stable\nof wives and concubines. Though the Yazidi and Mustaliq atrocities bookend\nnearly 1,400 years of Islamic history, their treatment of female captives was\nvirtually identical. Why? Because, as chronicled in \"Dabiq,\" what the Islamic\nState does in the 21st century is an authentic application of the teachings\nand practices of Muhammad. Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells the horrifying story of a\n13-year-old girl in Somalia who was found guilty of adultery after reporting\nthat she had been raped by three men. Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow - named after\nMuhammad's 9-year-old wife - was dragged, screaming and flailing, into a\nsports stadium in Kismayo to be stoned. \"It took four men to bury her up to\nher neck in the hole,\" Hirsi Ali wrote. \"Then fifty men spent ten minutes\npelting her with rocks and stones. Then she was dug out of the ground and two\nnurses examined her to see if she was still alive. Someone found a pulse and\nbreathing. Aisha was returned to the hole and the stoning continued.\" After\nshe died, \"a local sheik told a radio station that Aisha had provided\nevidence, confirmed her guilt, and 'was happy with the punishment under\nIslamic law.'\" When will equality-minded Americans stand up for women's rights\naround the globe?

            "input": "WASHINGTON Newly leaked emails show consternation among those closest to\nHillary Clinton about how Bill Clinton's business dealings might damage his\nreputation and potentially affect her presidential hopes. The emails, posted\nMonday by the WikiLeaks organization, also give insight into tension and\nturmoil within the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was serving as secretary\nof state. The chief operating officer of the family charity was reported to be\nthreatening to commit suicide over the stress. WikiLeaks began releasing on\nFriday what it says are years of messages from the accounts of Clinton\nCampaign Chairman John Podesta. Podesta has acknowledged his emails were\nhacked, but warned the messages may have been altered or edited to do\npolitical damage to Clinton. It wasn't immediately clear who hacked Podesta's\nemails, though U.S. intelligence officials last week blamed the Russian\ngovernment for a series of breaches and leaks intended to influence the\npresidential election. The emails that circulated among Podesta, Chelsea\nClinton and former Bill Clinton aide Doug Band detail internal tensions that\nsimmered inside the Clinton Foundation and appear to have played a role in\nBand's departure from the family charity. Internal concerns among Clinton\nfamily intimates about Band and the private corporate advisory firm he co-\nfounded, Teneo Holdings, have been previously detailed in several media\naccounts. But the new emails provide raw glimpses of an apparent power\nstruggle between the Clintons' daughter and Band, who worked closely for Bill\nClinton for more than a decade after the end of the Clinton administration. In\nan email exchange from December 2011, Chelsea Clinton tells Podesta and others\n- including Clinton adviser and current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe - that\nshe's increasingly concerned about Teneo. The email includes a forwarded news\narticle that alleges that Bill Clinton had collected $50,000 a month through\nTeneo from MF Global, the commodities brokerage formerly run by former New\nJersey Gov. Jon Corzine, while MF Global was preparing to file for bankruptcy.\nChelsea Clinton told Podesta and others that two people separately came up to\nher at a London event for the Clinton Foundation to raise concerns that\nsomeone representing Teneo clients had been calling members of the British\nParliament \"on behalf of President Clinton\" without her father's knowledge.\nChelsea Clinton said the calls had people in London \"making comparisons\"\nbetween the \"profit motivations\" of the former president and former Prime\nMinister Tony Blair. \"Which would horrify my father,\" Chelsea Clinton wrote.\nBand wrote in an email that Chelsea Clinton seemed more concerned about\ncritical news coverage about MF Global, a derivatives broker, and Band's\nadvisory firm, Teneo, than published reports about Bill Clinton's infidelity.\n\"I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go\n(too) far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems,\"\nBand vented in an exchange sent to Podesta. \"I don't deserve this from her and\ndeserve a tad more respect. ... She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has\nnothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she,\nas she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life.\"\nThe emails reflect the ascendance of Chelsea Clinton - as early as 2011 -\ninside the family charity. The younger Clinton was recently was anointed as\nthe Clinton Foundation's future leader if her mother wins the presidency next\nmonth. Bill Clinton announced in August that he planned to step down from the\ncharity's board if his wife becomes president. Chelsea Clinton will remain on\nthe organization's board. Bill Clinton explained in a letter to supporters in\nAugust that he would resign and stop raising funds for the charity to\neliminate \"legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\" Calls\nseeking comment from the Clinton Foundation and from Teneo, where Band works,\nreceived no response Monday. Also in December 2011, Clinton Foundation chief\noperating officer Laura Graham contacted Band to complain that stress she\nblamed on the former president and Chelsea Clinton was causing her to consider\nsuicide. Band wrote that when Graham called him, she was in her car parked\nnear the water with her foot on the gas pedal. He said he dissuaded her from\nhurting herself. \"She called me to tell me the stress of all of this office\ncrap with wjc and cvc as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge\nand she couldn't take it anymore,\" Band wrote in an email to Podesta and\nCheryl Mills, then Hillary Clinton's chief of staff. Graham later departed the\nClinton Foundation, taking a new job with the Empire State Development\nCorporation. Phone messages left for Graham on Monday received no response.\n(C) 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be\npublished, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.\n\n",

Yahoo was\nhacked in 2013, which affected all 3 billion of its accounts. [Irfan Khan |\nLos Angeles Times via TNS] WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump made his first\n\"Crooked Hillary\" Twitter post less than 48 hours into the new year Tuesday,\naccusing a former Clinton aide of \"disregarding basic security protocols,\" and\ncalling his own Justice Department a \"deep state.\" \"Crooked Hillary Clinton's\ntop aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security\nprotocols,\" he wrote. \"She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign\nagents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept\nmust finally act? Also on Comey &amp; others\" Attacking his former Democratic\nopponent from the 2016 presidential election and taking aim at his own Justice\nDepartment struck familiar tones for the new year. Almost 14 months after the\n2016 presidential election, Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on\nClinton. Last year, Trump also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney\nGeneral Jeff Sessions for not pursing investigations of his political\nopponents. Tuesday morning's Twitter post followed [an article in the Daily\nCaller,](http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/01/abedin-forwarded-state-passwords-\nto-yahoo-before-it-was-hacked-by-foreign-agents/) a conservative publication\nthat Trump closely monitors. The article said Abedin forwarded some government\npasswords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Clinton was\nsecretary of state. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all 3 billion of\nits accounts. After the breach, the data was offered for sale by a hacking\ncollective based in Eastern Europe. Trump also implored his administration to\ninvestigate Abedin. The term \"deep state\" typically refers to a shadow\ngovernment of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy; they are\nusually associated with countries that have authoritarian elements that\nundercut democratically elected leaders. On Friday, the State Department\nreleased about 3,000 of Abedin's work-related emails. The emails were found on\nthe laptop of Abedin's now estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and were\nreleased as part of a public records request. The emails found on Weiner's\ncomputer are a sore spot for Clinton. James Comey, the former FBI director,\nhad notified Congress shortly before the 2016 election about the existence of\nnewly discovered emails that could be relevant to the closed investigation\ninto Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state.\nClinton, in a book released last year, said Comey's October 2016 disclosure\nhurt her campaign's momentum and helped Trump win the election. In his Twitter\npost, Trump also referred to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for\ntaking pictures inside a military submarine. According to a report in Fox\nNews, the sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president, but has\nnot.\n\n",

She said: \"This is key because this\nPresident has made clear from the beginning and constantly throughout the\nfirst year of his presidency that a nuclearised North Korea is not just a\ndanger and a threat to America, and to any freedom and democracy loving\npeople, but to the entire world and the world is responding.\" It comes after\nPresident Trump threatened North Korea with his \"much bigger and more\npowerful\" nuclear button following menacing undertones in Kim Jong-un's speech\non New Year's Day. Mr Trump wrote on Twitter: \"North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un\njust stated that the 'Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.' \"Will\nsomeone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too\nhave a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than\nhis, and my Button works!\" North Korea has been fanning fears of World War 3\nby refusing to heed calls for denuclearisation - with leader Kim engaging\nPresident Trump in an escalating war of words. But Kim appeared to offer an\nolive branch to neighbouring South Korea - a close US ally - by suggesting\nNorth Korea could use the 2018 Winter Olympics to organise diplomatic talks\nwith Seoul to defuse tensions with the international community.\n\n",

            "input": "[ -- As a survivor of childhood sexual trauma, there are many misconceptions I\nlive with on a daily basis. My pain is treated as fodder for jokes and people\nwith backgrounds like mine are assumed to be abusers-in-the-making. Both of\nthese are very real issues, but today I want to talk about a third issue that\nmany people don't even realize about sexual abuse victims: the effect that the\nabuse has had in obscuring our own understanding of our sexual and gender\nidentities. It's impossible for some of us to even understand what an innate\ngender or sexual identity would even feel like. Our entire perception of our\n\"true\" gender and orientation is mutilated by our experiences. It's a well-\nestablished fact that child abuse does not cause homosexuality or gender\nfluidity, nor does gender fluidity or homosexuality cause people to become\nchild abusers. This is an important truth that needs to be continually\ndisseminated as too many people still think there is a causal link in one\ndirection or both. It is unfortunate, however, that the well-intentioned\ndesire to keep the LGBT community from being maligned has resulted in the\nexperiences of many CSA victims being silenced because it confuses the\nnarrative. It is a testimony that is actually quite simple: for many victims\nof CSA, especially repeated CSA, nothing about their identity can be fully\nseparated from the early trauma. That includes sexual orientation and gender\nidentity. Which means that many CSA survivors will tell you that they cannot\nsay with a straight face that their perception of their gender identity or\nsexual orientation was not shunted down a different road by their experiences.\nIt is a testimony that is actually quite simple: for many victims of CSA,\nespecially repeated CSA, nothing about their identity can be fully separated\nfrom the early trauma. This requires a steady mind and a grasp of nuance to\nunderstand what is being said. Obviously not all, or even the majority if, gay\nCSA victims attribute their orientation to their abuse. Nor do, or should,\ngender fluid victims give credit to abusers when it comes to discovering their\ntrue self. What it does mean, however, is that men who do say their identity\nwas affected by their trauma should not be dismissed out of hand. In abusive\nsituations, coercion is often mixed with reward (such as emotional attention)\nand being forced to do something can still lead to physical arousal. Such\nexperiences can rewire the brain into seeking out similar situations as an\nadult for complex psychological reasons other than because of natural\ninclination. Among male victims, the term \"SSA\" (same-sex attraction)\ncontinues to be a meaningful term. This is a term that in other circles has\nbecome appropriately abandoned, given the connection and connotations it has\nwith fundamentalist conversion therapies. On its face, the term is benign and\nnon-judgmental. In usage, however, it is a denial of orientation as an innate\nand non-changing element. That aspect of it, which when applied to homosexuals\nen masse is insulting and invalidating, is ironically exactly why some CSA\nsurvivors willingly apply it to themselves. Because they are not convinced\nthat their sexual attraction to men was not the result of early trauma. In\nfact, they feel as if recognizing that attraction and their true orientation\nare at odds is actually a more authentic description of themselves. I've seen\nthe term \"abuse reactive\" to label the difference between people who are able\nto know themselves apart from the abuse and people for whom the self before\nthe trauma is a black hole difficult or even impossible to ever fully explore.\nOne of the confusing aspects to this is that throughout history and even to\nthis day, boys who showed effeminate characteristics were and are more likely\nto be denied a proper support system. They are more likely to be bullied and\nsocially isolated and seen as unsatisfactory by both peers and adults. This\nputs them at a greater risk of abuse. No child is immune from the risk of\nbeing preyed upon, but many predators look for the outcast unlikely to be\nlistened to or believed and desperate for ANY adult attention. Therefore,\nbecause of society's prejudice, LGBT youth are often at greater risk of being\nsexually exploited. Drawn to signs of non-heteronormative behavior or not, a\npredator may very well strike before the boy himself understands his own\norientation and gender. Across his entire lifespan, a male is most in danger\nof being sexually assaulted between the ages of 4 and 13. Think about what you\ndidn't know about yourself at age 7. The risk here is that conversation like\nthis only gives fire to the bigots who want to say that there is something\n\"wrong\" with everyone who identifies as LGBT. That would be the wrong\ntakeaway. The correct lesson is to believe individuals. For those who say \"I\nwas always this way,\" believe them. For those who say \"I can't tell you for\nsure\" or \"I'm pretty sure my SSA was caused by my abuse,\" believe them too.\nDon't silence their voice because some people might misinterpret it. Don't\nassume you know their true selves better than they do. -- More on this subject\nby Dr. Joe Kort: Sexual abuse disorients you; it does not orient you. __ Photo\ncredit: ](https://foto.gettyimages.com/?et=bIJA-\naiHRrFq64icjsm9fw&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgoodmenproject.com%2Ffeatured-\ncontent%2Fidentity-in-a-fog-\nlbkr%2F&embedLink=EmbedSingleImage_thumbnail)[Getty\nImages](http://www.gettyimages.com/license/638971397)\n\n",

            "input": "Heading into Election Day 2016, the Donald Trump campaign has a very specific\npath to 270 Electoral College votes. In order to win the election, Trump must\nwin nearly every single battleground state and retain every state that Mitt\nRomney won in 2012 as well. Plus, there are a few states that Trump is hoping\nto flip from blue to red. So what exactly are the states that Trump needs to\nwin if he hopes to become president? First, there are 21 states that Donald\nTrump will win essentially by default. These are the states that traditionally\nalways vote for the Republican candidate, and they add up to 163 Electoral\nCollege votes. If Hillary Clinton were to somewhat win in just one of these\nstates, it would be a complete shock. The states are: Alabama Alaska Arkansas\nIdaho Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska\nNorth Dakota Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah West\nVirginia Wyoming Then there are two states that usually vote for the\nRepublican candidate but where Hillary Clinton has actually been somewhat\nclose in the polls. Still, it seems likely that these states will stay red as\nthey have been for a long time, but it's necessary for Trump to defend himself\nhere if he wants to win the election. Those states are: Arizona Georgia If we\nadd these two states to Donald Trump's column, plus all the traditionally red\nstates, the Republican nominee is now at 190 Electoral College votes. He needs\n80 more votes to become president. What remains are six battleground states\nthat could realistically be won by either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.\nThose battlegrounds are: Florida Iowa Maine's 2nd Congressional District\nNevada New Hampshire North Carolina Ohio All of these states add up to 80\nElectoral College votes, meaning that if Trump wins all of the states we have\nmentioned so far, he hits 270 electors exactly, and he becomes the next\npresident of the United States. The state that Donald Trump absolutely must\nwin in order to be elected president is Florida. Technically Trump can win\nwithout it, but the path would become so narrow as a result that it's almost\nimpossible to imagine Hillary Clinton not winning if she turns Florida blue.\nIf Florida is called for Hillary Clinton on the evening of November 8th, you\ncan essentially consider this the announcement that Hillary Clinton has won\nthe presidency. Florida is worth 29 Electoral College votes. Really, though,\nTrump does not have much wiggle room, and so basically all of the six\nbattleground states - plus one battleground district - are must wins for him.\nBecause the aforementioned path is so narrow, the Trump campaign is also\nlooking at a fourth category, states that are leaning towards Hillary Clinton\nand that traditionally vote blue but that Trump hopes he can turn red. Winning\nany one of these would dramatically increase his odds of victory, as they\nwould give him some room to lose another battleground state but still win the\nelection. Winning any of them would also start eating into Hillary Clinton's\npath rather than simply forging Donald Trump's. Those blue states, accompanied\nby the lead Hillary Clinton currently has in the polls according to Real Clear\nPolitics, are: Colorado (Clinton +3) Michigan (Clinton +5) Minnesota (Clinton\n+6.4) Pennsylvania (Clinton +2.8) Virginia (Clinton +4.3) Wisconsin (Clinton\n+6.5) To summarize, with each of the battlegrounds (Florida, Iowa, Maine's 2nd\nCongressional District, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio) losing\none means Trump must make up for it by winning a combination of blue states\n(Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin) . If\nTrump loses a single battleground but does not compensate for it with a\nvictory in a blue state, Hillary Clinton wins the election. And if Trump loses\ntwo battleground states, that will be almost impossible to recover from. With\nthat in mind, here are a few scenarios, albeit somewhat unlikely scenarios,\nwhere Trump could recover from the loss in a battleground state.

            "input": "Another day, another uncomfortably shady revelation about Donald Trump's\npresidential campaign and possible connections to Russia. This time, it's the\nnews that [FBI investigators wiretapped Trump campaign chair Paul\nManafort](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/politics/paul-manafort-government-\nwiretapped-fisa-russians/index.html?adkey=bn) not once, but two times before\nand after the presidential election, per a CNN report. The news source\nreported on Sept. 18 that the surveillance continued into the early part of\n2017, when Manafort had long since left the Trump team but was still in\ncommunications with the President. Several sources told CNN that the\nintelligence which the investigation collected included communications that\n\"sparked concerns… that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the\ncampaign,\" though at least two sources specifically added that the evidence\nwasn't conclusive. Manafort was surveilled under a Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act (FISA) warrant, which must be backed with information showing\nsuspicion that the subject could be acting as an agent of a foreign power. The\nwarrant must be approved by top officials in the FBI and the Department of\nJustice. Notably, there's a big piece of the puzzle missing. CNN reports that\nthe FBI was not surveilling Manafort during the now-infamous meeting between\nDonald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer with Kremlin connections in June 2016,\nwhich then-campaign manager Manafort and Trump's son-in-law and current White\nHouse adviser Jared Kushner also attended. But even with the missing pieces,\nthe fact that government investigators were able to get the warrant, with such\na high bar for approval, means that things are getting real for the\ninvestigation into Trump campaign leaders' dealings with Russia. Manafort was\noriginally investigated for his alleged shady dealings with former Ukrainian\npresident Viktor Yanukovych, who was at the head of a pro-Russian party which\nwas driven out in 2014 by civil unrest and street protests. Manafort's firm\nwas [accused of lobbying for\nYanukovych](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-05-22/paul-manafort-\ns-lucrative-ukraine-years-are-central-to-the-russia-probe)'s interests while\nfailing to register with the U.S. government as a lobbyist for a foreign\npower. In fact, that accusation is [why Manafort left the Trump\ncampaign](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/paul-manafort-resigns-from-\ntrump-campaign-227197) back in August of 2016, after reports of the\nconnections surfaced. But if the first warrant was based on his dealings with\nsketchy oligarchs, the second one is reportedly the more damning. CNN's\nsources said that the second warrant, the start date of which is unknown, was\nbased on efforts to investigate possible ties between Trump campaign\nassociates and Russian agents. So basically, for the first warrant there\nneeded to be suspicion that Manafort was dealing with the Ukrainians (which,\n[yeah, he was](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/manafort-firm-\nmade-usd17-million-for-ukraine-lobbying.html)). For the second, investigators\nneeded suspicion he was talking to Russian operatives -- which is way more\nspecific, and given Manafort's role in the Trump campaign, could be incredibly\ndamning. On the other hand, the report also gives some near-credibility to\nTrump's old claim that former President Barack Obama was wiretapping him (and\nby \"credibility,\" I mean you have to tilt your head and squint to \"see\" it).\nBack in March, Trump tweeted an accusation that Obama had wiretapped him at\nhis residence at his eponymous Trump Tower shortly before the 2016 election,\ncalling the former president \"sick.\" Representatives of both Obama and the\nDepartment of Justice said that [the claims were\nbaseless](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/no-evidence-trump-claim-obama-\nwiretapped-trump-tower-doj/). While Manafort keeps a residence at Trump Tower,\nthere is still no evidence Trump himself was under surveillance. Which,\nhowever, doesn't mean he wasn't picked up by the surveillance on Manafort. CNN\nnotes that Trump and Manafort continued to communicate for months after\nManafort left the campaign, even after the FBI investigation into the former\ncampaign manager became public knowledge. The conversations reportedly\ncontinued until lawyers for both men \"insisted they stop.\" But this isn't even\nthe worst news for Manafort that came out today. Special counsel Robert\nMueller, who is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the\nelection, reportedly told Manafort in July that the [investigation planned to\nindict him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-\ninvestigation.html?_r=0), according to The New York Times. Agents reportedly\nshowed up at Manafort's house with a search warrant, combing through his\nVirginia home and taking away binders of documents, computer files, and even\nphotos of his wardrobe. A physical search warrant is unusual for someone whose\nlawyer has already been in touch with the Justice Department, as Manafort's\nhas been -- and is an indicator that prosecutors had probable cause to believe\nthat the home contained evidence of a crime, and were concerned about\ndestruction of evidence.

At the most, it could turn at least some\nvoters to rival Donald Trump, who has rested much of his pitch on the argument\nthat Clinton is dishonest and who grabbed at the news immediately as a gift to\nsalvage his trailing campaign. With less but still important impact, it could\nfreeze the momentum to Clinton that has helped her pull ahead in past weeks.\nAt a minimum, it could have a nominal effect on an electorate that already had\ndoubts about her honesty, and has already started voting. FBI Director James\nComey set off the late October furor with a letter to Congress on Friday\nsaying the agency was launching another investigation into Clinton's personal\nemail server after obtaining additional information in an unrelated case\nThursday. \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be\npertinent to the investigation,\" Comey wrote in the\n[letter](https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/102816_FBI-\nLetter.pdf). \"I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative\nsteps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine\nwhether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their\nimportance to our investigation.\" Breaking News Be the first to know when big\nnews breaks Recaptcha requires verification. protected by reCAPTCHA\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\-\n[Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\-\n[Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) Loaded: 0% Progress:\n0% Current TimeÂ 0:00 / DurationÂ 3:10 Trump on newly discovered Clinton\nemails: at last justice will be done Advertisement Donald Trump was holding a\nrally in New Hampshire when news broke that the FBI would review new emails in\nits investigation of Hillary Clinton. He called the inquiry \"bigger than\nWatergate.\" By McClatchy Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta called the\nannouncement so late in the campaign \"extraordinary\" and urged the FBI to\nrelease all of the details of what it is examining. \"We are confident this\nwill not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in\nJuly,\" Podesta said, referring to the FBI decision earlier not to seek any\nprosecution of Clinton. His eagerness to address the matter as fast as\npossible underscored the mysterious nature of the new investigation and the\nimpact it could have. Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been\nbaselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private,\nbrowbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a\ndesperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Clinton\ncampaign chairman John Podesta The news spread quickly, including through the\nbattleground state of North Carolina, one of several where a turn of a few\npercentage points still could decide the race. \"This is definitely going to\ninfluence me,\" said Democrat James Smythers, a warehouse manager from\nPrinceton, North Carolina. \"I'll lean to Trump if he makes her pay for what\nshe's done.\" A great day in our campaign just got even better.

He said:\n\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal\nrecords, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two\nmillion, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our\ncountry or we are going to incarcerate. \"But we're getting them out of our\ncountry, they're here illegally.\" He said a \"determination\" would be made\nabout remaining illegal immigrants.

In the main. the protests have been peaceful\nand have decried Mr Trump for his campaign promises to clamp down on\nimmigration and register Muslims along with claims the former reality TV star\nhad sexually abused women. So far, arrests have been in the dozens and a\nnumber of police have been injured. Slogans including \"not my President\" and\n\"love trumps hate\" were chanted by campaigners on the march in New York, Los\nAngeles, Chicago and elsewhere. Protesters say Mr Trump threatens their civil\nand human rights. A protestor in New York holds a sign which reads, 'Trump is\nnot my President' The protests come as it emerged that Hillary Clinton could\nreceive two million more votes than Mr Trump when the final tally is made. The\nlatest findings show Democrat Mrs Clinton has received 400,000 more votes than\nthe President-elect - 60.4 million compared with 60 million. Millions of votes\nare yet to be counted in the pro-Democrat state of California and experts\nbelieve Mrs Clinton's win of the popular vote could be extended to two\nmillion. Campaigners are fighting for reform as they suggest the US electoral\ncollege system is outdated. The result is similar to the situation which arose\nin the 2000 election when Al Gore lost having defeated George W Bush in the\npopular vote.\n\n",

Here are some people involved in the latest political drama. ANTHONY\nWEINER Once a rising star in the Democratic Party, Weiner was an outspoken and\ntelegenic congressman from the outer boroughs of New York City. He married\nsenior Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin in 2010 in a ceremony officiated by\nBill Clinton, and was mentored by Sen. Chuck Schumer. Then, in 2011, he\naccidentally tweeted an explicit photo from himself, which eventually led to\nhis resignation from Congress. FILE - In this July 24, 2013 file photo, New\nYork City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner leaves his apartment building in\nNew York. He launched a comeback bid for Mayor of New York City in 2013, and\nwas briefly the frontrunner until it was revealed that he was still sending\nexplicit photos to people other than his wife, sometimes under the pseudonym\nCarlos Danger. Over this past summer, authorities opened an investigation into\nWeiner's alleged sexting with an underage girl, which at one point included a\npicture of his young son. Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner\nin August, but the investigation eventually led to the discovery of a laptop\ncontaining thousands of emails potentially relating to the FBI investigation\nof Hillary Clinton's email server. JAMES COMEY Appointed FBI director in\nSeptember 2013 by President Obama, Comey has a long and distinguished record\nin law enforcement, including a stint as U.S. Attorney for the Southern\nDistrict of New York from 2002 to 2003. He then became a deputy attorney\ngeneral under President George W. Bush until 2005 before leaving to accept a\nseries of lucrative private sector jobs. FBI Director James Comey makes a\nstatement at FBI Headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, July 5, 2016. A\nRepublican for most of his life, Comey contributed to the presidential\ncampaigns of both Sen. John McCain and Gov. Mitt Romney, but said in 2016 he\nwas no longer registered with the GOP. In July, he attracted criticism from\nRepublicans for declining to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton over\nthe use of her private email server, a decision he announced in a press\nconference. Last week, he sent a letter to Congress notifying the chairs of\nrelevant committees that the investigation had resumed due to information\nobtained during a separate investigation. It was later revealed that FBI\ninvestigators looking into Anthony Weiner had found a laptop used by him and\nhis wife, Huma Abedin, containing thousands of emails potentially going to-\nand-from Clinton's private server. ANDREW MCCABE McCabe joined the FBI in\n1996, serving out of the New York field office and focusing on organized\ncrime. According to his official FBI biography, he has held senior positions\nin the counterterrorism and national security divisions, eventually becoming\ndeputy director, the bureau's second-in-command position, in February. His\nwife, Jill McCabe, was an unsuccessful Democratic Virginia state senate\ncandidate in 2015, and received nearly $500,000 in campaign funds from Gov.\nTerry McAuliffe political action committee. McAuliffe is a close Clinton ally,\nbut Andrew McCabe still reportedly oversaw the wide-ranging investigation into\nHillary Clinton's private email server. McCabe did, however, recuse himself\nfrom a separate investigation into McAuliffe due to his wife's ties to the\ngovernor. In early October, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal's\nDevlin Barrett, agents investigating Anthony Weiner notified McCabe that a\nlaptop had been discovered that could contain emails pertinent to the separate\ninvestigation of Hillary Clinton's email server. FBI investigators originally\nlooked through the laptop looking for child pornography, and required another\ncourt order to look for emails relating to the server to-and-from Weiner's\nwife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. JASON CHAFFETZ The GOP chairman of the House\nOversight Committee has been closely tracking the FBI's investigation into\nHillary Clinton's use of private email servers as secretary of state. On\nFriday, Chaffetz tweeted that FBI Director James Comey had learned about new\nemails pertinent to its investigation into Clinton. Comey had sent him and\nother Republican committee chairmen on Capitol Hill a vague letter about the\ndiscovery. Chaffetz said that the case had been reopened.

REUTERS/Gary Cameron - RTS29RH Before the development, Chaffetz told The\nWashington Post last week that he planned to spend \"years\" investigating\nClinton. JILL MCCABE Despite never running for office before, McCabe launched\na campaign last year to run for a state Senate seat in Virginia. She is the\nwife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe who, has been overseeing the\ninvestigation into Hillary Clinton's use of private email servers when she led\nthe State Department. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a former top aide to the\nClintons, reportedly recruited McCabe for the seat in an effort to tip the\nbalance of the state Senate. While she was recruited around the time that The\nNew York Times broke the Clinton emails story, the FBI didn't launch its\ninvestigation into it until July 2015 and Andrew McCabe wasn't promoted to his\ncurrent role until earlier this year. McAuliffe's political action committee\ndonated nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe's campaign, which was unsuccessful.\nChaffetz asked Andrew McCabe last week to provide documents about his wife's\nSenate campaign amid questions about a possible conflict of interest. Huma\nAbedin The emails being reviewed by the FBI were found on laptop belonging to\nAnthony Weiner in the course of a separate investigation into Huma Abedin's\nnow-estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. He was allegedly sexting with a\n15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Abedin was said to be \"surprised\" by the\nemails on the computer, and during her interview with the FBI, she said she\nhad given up all relevant electronic devices used for emails relating to her\nwork for Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. After an earlier\nsexting scandal over the summer, Abedin announced she was separating from\nWeiner. Abedin was deputy chief of staff for Clinton but served in the\ncapacity of a consultant, rather than as State Department staff. During this\ntime, she also consulted for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm founded by a\nformer Bill Clinton aide, Doug Band, and for the Clinton Foundation. Her\noverlapping jobs have been at the center of questions about whether Clinton's\nState Department was too close to the Clinton Foundation and to Teneo. Abedin\nhas been called the Clintons' \"second daughter\" \\-- Bill Clinton even\nofficiated at her 2010 wedding to Weiner. She was born in Michigan to Saudi\nintellectuals and was subsequently raised in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. She\nreturned to the U.S. for college and became an intern for Clinton in 1996, who\nwas first lady at the time. She has served as traveling chief of staff and\nsenior adviser to Clinton, as well. TERRY MCAULIFFE A close Clinton ally and\nformer chair of the Democratic National Committee, McAulifee was elected\nVirginia governor in 2013. McAuliffe's PAC donated nearly $500,000 to the\nVirginia state senate election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI\nofficial Andrew McCabe. According to The Wall Street Journal, McCabe oversaw\nthe investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while\nshe was secretary of state. At the same time, the Virginia Democratic Party\ncontributed another $207,778 in the form of mailers to McCabe. The Virginia\ngovernor responded to insinuations by Republicans that his PAC's donation to\nMcCabe was an attempt to influence the FBI. \"I think we're in silly season,\"\nhe told WTVR last week. The only time he met her husband, Andrew McCabe, was\non Mar. 7, he said: \"It was about Jill, highly qualified, she's a medical\ndoctor, and she's a community leader. That's why we were supporting her.\"\nMcCabe ultimately lost the election to incumbent GOP State Sen. Dick Black.\nFILE - In this Jan. 13, 2016 file photo, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\ngestures as he delivers his State of the Commonwealth Address before a joint\nsession of the 2016 Virginia Assembly at the Capitol in Richmond, Va. The FBI\nis also investigating the propriety of some donations to McAuliffe's own 2013\ngubernatorial campaign, including one by Chinese businessman, Wang Wenliang,\nCNN reported. Wang was born in China but is a permanent U.S. resident, which\ncould make him eligible to make campaign contributions. McAuliffe's friendship\nwith both Clintons goes back to Bill Clinton's presidency -- he was one of\nClinton's top fundraisers and later went on to chair the DNC. When the\nClintons were short of money after they left the White House burdened by legal\ndebt, it was McAuliffe who secured the loan with $1.35 million of his own\nmoney, the New York Times' Adam Nagourney reported at the time (they paid him\nback soon after). And the Clintons were big supporters of both his\ngubernatorial bids.\n\n",

            "input": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The U.S. government improperly spent $84 million to help\nplan for a massive project to ship Northern California water to Southern\nCalifornia, a new federal audit said. Federal officials gave $84 million to\nhelp finance the water districts' planning, backed by Democratic Gov. Jerry\nBrown, to build two giant water tunnels to re-engineer the state's water\nsystem, according to the audit by the inspector general's office of the U.S.\nInterior Department obtained by The Associated Press. By California law and by\nan agreement by the water districts, California water districts and not\nfederal taxpayers are supposed to bear the costs of the $16 billion project,\nthe audit said. The proposed tunnels are part of Brown's decadeslong push for\na project that would more readily carry water from green Northern California\nsouth, mainly for use by cities and farms in central and Southern California.\nVoters rejected an early version of the proposal in a statewide vote in the\n1980s. California water districts are making final decisions on whether to go\nahead with the controversial project. The inspector general says federal\nauthorities did not fully disclose to Congress or others that it was covering\nmuch of the cost of the project's planning. The actions by the Bureau of\nReclamation, which is part of the Interior Department, mean that federal\ntaxpayers paid a third of the cost of the project's planning up to 2016, the\naudit said. Central Valley water districts that were supposed to pay 50\npercent of the tunnels' planning costs contributed only 18 percent, the audit\nfound. California officials, meanwhile, have consistently said no taxpayer\nmoney was being spent on the project. Asked if auditors wanted contractors to\nrepay the money, Interior spokeswoman Nancy DiPaolo said, \"We certainly hope\nso.\" That decision was up to California, she said. Thomas Birmingham, general\nmanager of the sprawling Central Valley rural water district Westlands, which\nreceived one of the largest shares from the government, said he knew of\nnothing about the arrangement that was \"inconsistent with either state or\nfederal law.\" \"The state was aware of it,\" Birmingham said of the federal\npayments. \"No one indicated this was somehow a violation of the letter or\nspirit of the agreement\" guiding the costs of the project. Birmingham said\nwater districts would be responsible for reimbursing the federal money if the\nproject went forward and benefited those districts. Spokespeople for the\nBureau of Reclamation, Brown's office and the state Department of Water\nResources either had no immediate comment Friday or did not respond to\nrequests for comment. The audit's findings were \"appalling,\" said Doug Obegi\nof the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group, which has\nopposed the project on the grounds that it would speed up the extinction of\nseveral endangered native species. \"The public is paying for what a private\nparty is supposed to pay for,\" Obegi said. \"That is taking the public's money,\nand that's not OK.\" A former lobbyist for Westlands, David Bernhardt, has been\na top official in the Interior Department under the George W. Bush\nadministration and again under Trump. Critics long have said Westlands has\nbenefited from its ties to the federal agency, which the water district and\nInterior deny. \"I wish I were surprised to learn that the Westlands Water\nDistrict colluded with the Interior Department to hide millions of dollars in\nunauthorized payments from Congress, but this is typical of the longstanding\nand incestuous relationship between the largest irrigation district in the\ncountry and its federal patrons,\" said U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a California\nDemocrat.\n\n",

But [federal\ndata](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/2013-14-first-look.pdf)\nshowing that even at the preschool level black students are nearly four times\nas likely to be suspended as their white peers is especially shocking. What it\nsuggests is that racial biases are creeping into classrooms filled with\n4-year-olds and that schools are effectively criminalizing black children,\nparticularly boys, when they are barely out of diapers. Two years ago, federal\ncivil rights officials issued guidance calling on school districts to train\ntheir teachers to overcome this problem and showing districts how to recognize\nand avoid discriminatory practices. But researchers are just beginning to\nunderstand the psychological mechanisms that lead teachers who see themselves\nas loving, supportive figures to discriminate against minorities. Chief among\nthese mechanisms, [according to a new\nreport](http://ziglercenter.yale.edu/publications/briefs.aspx)from Yale\nUniversity's Child Study Center, are racial preconceptions that shape the way\nthe teachers view black boys in particular. These preconceptions were found to\nexist in black as well as white preschool teachers. In the study, the Yale\nresearchers showed teachers a dozen brief video clips of four well-behaved\npreschool-aged children, two boys, one black and one white, and two girls, one\nblack and one white, working and playing together in a classroom. Though the\nchildren were behaving calmly, the teachers were asked to look for signs of\nbehavior that might become problematic. A computer program that tracked the\neyes of the teachers as they watched the video showed that both black and\nwhite teachers watched the black children, especially the boys, longer when\nlooking for signs of trouble. And when the researchers asked teachers which\nchild had commanded the most attention, 42 percent of them chose the black\nboy, 34 percent the white boy, 13 percent the white girl and 10 percent the\nblack girl. In other words, the black boy in this study received far more\nscrutiny from teachers than his behavior warranted. This brings to mind the\n\"driving while black\" phenomenon, in which police officers stop African-\nAmerican motorists without cause, or stop-and-frisk practices that\npredominantly single out blacks. The Yale study is consistent with previous\nresearch suggesting that teachers tend to see \"acting out\" by black children\nas more threatening than similar behavior in white children, and thus\ndeserving of disproportionately harsher punishments. This is counterproductive\non a number of counts, but what's really at stake here is the future of these\nchildren, whose early disciplinary problems put them at greater risk later on\nof falling behind, dropping out and eventually getting caught up in the\njuvenile justice system.\n\n",

The center\n[reported](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/#Harvey)Thursday afternoon that the\ntropical storm will make landfall late Friday night or early Saturday morning\nalong the south-central Texas coast. \"Harvey has intensified quickly this\nmorning, and is now forecast to be a major hurricane at landfall, bringing\nlife-threatening storm surge, rainfall, and wind hazards to portions of the\nTexas coast,\" the center wrote. People residing like coastal cities like\nCorpus Christi were encouraged to evacuate from their homes on Thursday. The\nmayor Joe McComb, called for people to leave in the \"strongest possible\nterms.\" Some are surprised how much the hurricane has strengthened. A\nhurricane warning was issued for the Texas coast early Thursday, blanketing an\narea from Port Mansfield to Matagorda. Forecasters indicated that Harvey could\nbecome a hurricane after regaining tropical storm strength and began drifting\ntowards the Gulf of Mexico. Harvey's maximum sustained winds increased to near\n60 mph Thursday, re-establishing its status as a tropical storm. The U.S.\nNational Hurricane Center said additional strengthening is expected, resulting\nin Harvey emerging as a hurricane by the time its expected to reach Texas's\nsouthern coast Friday. Some Twitter users on Thursday voiced alarm over\nHarvey, while others noted its name's resemblance to comedian Steve Harvey.\nHarvey was centered about 335 miles southeast of Port Mansfield around 8 a.m.\nlocal time Thursday and heading north-northwest at about 10 mph. Texas Gov.\nGreg Abbott (R) ordered the State Operations Center to elevate its readiness\nlevel, freeing up resources there for possible rescue and recovery maneuvers.\nThe governor also pre-emptively declared a state of disaster for 30 counties\non or near the Texas coast to speed the deployment of state resources to those\nimpacted. Texas emergency officials on Wednesday asked residents along the\nstate's upper coastline to relocate or prepare to head inland. People in low-\nlying areas were urged to seek higher ground, and individuals elsewhere were\ninstructed to closely follow official announcements. Rice farmers in coastal\nMatagorda County late Wednesday rushed to harvest their crops as Harvey nears.\nPeople on South Padre Island, for their part, filled sandbags that evening to\nprotect exposed businesses and houses from the storm. Other locations in the\nforecast path, finally, sought out generators, plywood and other goods from\nhardware stores as a safety precaution.

            "input": "Hillary Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, will be campaigning in Wisconsin\nFriday. In a wide-ranging interview, he spoke to \"CBS This Morning's\" Norah\nO'Donnell Thursday at his home state of Virginia. He addressed the controversy\nsurrounding the U.S. cash payment of $400 million to Iran, which Donald Trump\nclaims is ransom for U.S. hostages released around the same time in January.\nThe Obama administration has strongly denied paying ransom. \"If you were vice\npresident, would you allow a plane full of money to land in Iran on the same\nday that four U.S. hostages are freed?\" O'Donnell asked. \"Here's the thing.\nAnd Congress was briefed on this months ago. Again, I'm on these committees\nand we're aware of it. Iran had a sizeable legal claim against the United\nStates that has been pending in international law for a very long time. There\nwas a settlement of that claim. A settlement where the U.S. agreed to pay a\nfraction of the claim. And yes, the U.S. then paid that claim,\" Kaine said. \"I\nunderstand that, but let's talk about the perception of on the very same day a\nplane with $400 million in foreign currency landing and being delivered. ...\nIs that ransom?\" O'Donnell asked. \"Perception is one thing. Reality matters\nmore. We got hostages home and we took a legal claim that was a legit claim\nand bargained it down to a fraction and we paid that claim out,\" Kaine said.\n\"That's the reality.\" \"So as vice president, you would do that same deal? If\nyou were vice president you would let it happen?\" O'Donnell asked. \"I would\nnegotiate any legal claim that we had and I'd try to get the best deal we\ncould. And I'd also try to get American hostages home,\" Kaine said. The\nVirginia senator, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed\nServices Committees, also addressed Trump's claims that he saw a video of the\ncash transfer between U.S. and Iran showing \"money pouring off a plane.\" Trump\nclaimed the Iranian government released the footage to embarrass the U.S. \"I\nhave no idea what he's talking about,\" Kaine said. \"That video doesn't exist?\"\nO'Donnell asked. \"It doesn't exist. I-- he might be thinking about Iran Contra\nfrom, like, 35 years ago or something like this. He recently criticized me\nsaying I was a bad governor of New Jersey,\" Kaine said. O'Donnell pointed out\nTrump may have confused Kaine with Tom Kean. \"Tom [Kean] was the governor of\nJersey 26 years ago. I mean, so it hurt my feelings till I realized, 'Wait a\nminute. I was never governor of New Jersey. I didn't even live in New Jersey.'\nHe was confusing it with a situation from two or three decades ago. Maybe\nthat's what he's doing with this video claim,\" Kaine said. \"You think Donald\nTrump is confused?\" O'Donnell asked. \"I absolutely think he's confused,\" Kaine\nresponded. Campaigning in Kaine's state of Virginia, Trump said he would take\ncare of veterans better than anybody. \"I don't think anybody believes that,\"\nKaine said. \"I mean here's what he's done in my home state just in the last\ntwo weeks. ... He trashed a Virginia family, the Khan family from\nCharlottesville, whose son is a UVA grad, who was a hero who was killed.\nTrashed this Gold Star family. He came to a rally in northern Virginia a\ncouple of days ago and kicked a crying baby out of a rally. And then he had\nthe nerve to say to the crowd, 'Hey, things are going lousy for you here.'\nThis is Loudoun County. Loudoun County has the highest family income in the\nUnited States. ... But he told them how bad things were. This is not the way\nto win friends and influence people, to come into a state, trash military\nfamilies, trash institutions that people care about and perpetrate sort of a\nfalsehood about the state -- the state of the state's economy.\" Kaine also\nsaid Trump has \"spent his whole life bragging about how he uses every dodge he\ncan to pay as few taxes as he can.\" \"How do veterans services get supported?\nThey get supported by people like you and me paying taxes because we want to\nhonor their service and sacrifice. A guy who tries to dodge paying taxes is no\nfriend of vets,\" Kaine said. \"At the Democratic convention, the former mayor\nof New York City, Michael Bloomberg, spoke and he said that Americans need a\nsane and competent president. Do you think Donald Trump is sane and\ncompetent?\" O'Donnell asked. \"Oh, I don't know Donald Trump, so I'm not gonna\nmake any comment about mental capacity, et cetera. Why would I do that? I\ndon't know him,\" Kaine said. \"But again, when you say things, they reveal who\nyou are. And when somebody shows you who they are, you oughta trust that.\"\nWhile the Clinton campaign has embraced President Obama's popularity, Kaine\ndenied that a Clinton-Kaine administration would be a third Obama term. \"And\nit's not a third Bill Clinton term. It is the first Hillary Clinton term. And\nit's very, very important that that be the case,\" Kaine said. \"I think what\nyou're gonna see in Hillary Clinton's choice of people around her when she\ngets in, is a very clear signal that we're taking advantage of new talent, new\nideas, innovative people. Because this is the first Hillary Clinton term and I\nthink she's gonna make that plain from the very first day,\" he added. \"But how\nare they different? It's no secret that President Obama has not had the\nwarmest of relations with Republicans in Congress. And as a result, there's\nbeen a lot of gridlock on a lot of really important issues facing this\ncountry,\" O'Donnell said. \"What would [Clinton] do differently than President\nObama?\" \"I wouldn't lay the gridlock just at President Obama's feet,\" Kaine\nsaid. \"Remember, before he even made his first visit to Congress there was a\nmeeting of Congressional Republican leadership and they said, 'Our top goal is\nto make him a one term president.' So I think you have the put a good bit of\nthat on Congress' shoulders.\" Kaine said he gets along with Senate Majority\nLeader Mitch McConnell. \"But let me tell you what's more important. The number\nof Republicans who tell me, 'You know, Hillary was actually a really good\nsenator.' They tell me that all the time,\" Kaine said. \"So you think Hillary\nClinton has better relationships with Republicans than Barack Obama?\"\nO'Donnell asked. \"She was in the Senate for eight years and then four years as\nsecretary of state, so she has got 12 years of working together with the\nSenate,\" Kaine said. \"When the president was elected -- and I'm a big\nsupporter of President Obama and a friend -- he had been in the Senate four\nyears. Two years he was running. So just in terms of the time into the\nrelationships. Yes, on her first day she will have a deeper well of\nrelationships in Congress than President Obama had on his first day.\"\n\n",

The National Hurricane Center's\nlatest forecast shows that the hurricane is likely to hit or brush Florida\nthen to go back out to sea. It is not yet known when the hurricane will leave\nthe coast at Florida or further north in Georgia or the Carolinas. Some models\nare now showing that Hurricane could go out to sea and then do a u-turn and\nhead back to Florida for second time. This would be a devastating double blow\nfor the state where thousands of Americans have been told to evacuate the\ncoast before it is \"too late\". This is the latest map from the National\nHurricane Centre The Met Office storm tracker yesterday showed the hurricane\nwas going to make a clear loop back in the direction of Florida But the latest\nmap has been updated and shows the hurricane heading further out into the\nocean towards Bermuda. The Met Office said: \"There is high uncertainty in the\nmovement of Matthew early next week. \"It may stay out at sea and slowly\nweaken, but there is a possibility that it will make a clockwise loop and head\ntowards Florida or the Bahamas again.\" This is the map from the Met Office\nstorm tracker on Wednesday October 5 This is the updated map from the Met\nOffice storm tracker on Thursday October 6 Met Office tropical prediction\nscientist Julian Heming said there is a \"huge amount of uncertainty\" about\nwhat Matthew does next. He said that some of the models yesterday showed that\nthe Matthew could drift off out to sea and then \"lift off\" the northeast.\nOther models showed that the hurricane could go off the coast but then loop\nround to the south, possibly back to the Bahamas and Florida. But Mr Heming\nsaid its was \"far from clear\" what was going to happen that far in advance\nbecause hurricanes often change course. Large swathes of this section of the\nEast Coast are being evacuated and under states of emergency as the hurricane\napproaches.

Shortly before the\nDemocratic National Convention, the activist released incriminating email\nshowing that the DNC had worked against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in\nfavor of a Clinton nomination. Though that did much to shake up supporters of\nthe American political system and infuriate supporters of Sanders, the Vermont\nSenator pledged his support to Clinton nonetheless. He cited that it was\nimportant to unify the party and prevent a Trump presidency. Rigged or not\n(and it's most definitely rigged), is this truly the reason Bernie Sanders\ngave up the good fight? According to Assange, Bernie Sanders was threatened.\nDuring an interview with Australian journalist John Pilger, who is based in\nthe United Kingdom, Assange disclosed some very concerning information.\nPilger, who is working on a documentary about Assange,\n[asked](http://www.usasupreme.com/assange-bernie-sanders-was-threatened-to-\ndrop-out-of-the-race/): \"Julian, we cut you off earlier when you were talking\nabout what you felt were the most significant emails that you have released.\nIs there any last one that you'd like to mention?

Whoever--whatever political party\ngets into government is going to merge with the bureaucracy pretty damn fast.\nIt will be in a position where it has some levers in its hand.

He says he has\nevidence that Hillary made deals with an alleged Islamic state sponsor, as\nwell as damning information about the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton campaign\nknows he's on to her, too, which is why a strategist called for an\nassassination of Assange on TV. \"Of course, we're very interested in revealing\nthe truth about any candidate and yes we have some material about Bernie\nSanders that will be published,\" Assange added.

The culprits must be caught and brought to justice.\" Dallas\nWoodhouse, executive director of the state GOP, called the bombing \"political\nterrorism.\" \"The office itself is a total loss,\" he said. \"The only thing\nimportant to us is that nobody was killed, and they very well could have\nbeen.\" Later, Woodhouse said, \"Whether you are Republican, Democrat or\nIndependent, all Americans should be outraged by this hate-filled and violent\nattack against our democracy. … Everyone in this country should be free to\nexpress their political viewpoints without fear for their own safety.\" The\nflaming bottle, which Woodhouse described as a significant Molotov cocktail,\nand bomb, was thrown through a window that bore the words \"Freedom spoken\nhere.\" \"This is a horrific, horrific act of political terrorism, one that we\nwill not succumb to and one that we will answer,\" he said. \"When people try to\nstifle freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, you must come back with more\nspeech and aggressively defend your rights.\" Woodhouse also mentioned the\ngraffiti that said \"Nazi Republicans leave town or else.\" \"Or else what? That\nis what we all wonder, or else what,\" he said. \"Because we're not going\nanywhere.\" Woodhouse said a van had already been brought in from Durham, and\ncampaigners would go back to work in the heavily Democratic county. Volunteer\nBob Randall was there to clean up Sunday. He said he believes that the bombing\nwas an act of political terrorism and that it would get people angry and\nmotivated to vote Republican. \"The idea is to intimidate us, to make us crawl\nback in the shadows,\" he said. \"But I think it's going to backfire on them.\"\nThe incident comes barely three weeks before an election marked by heightened\ntensions and passion on both sides. On Sunday the Bangor Daily News reported\nthat about 20 cars were vandalized with spray paint outside a Saturday rally\nfor GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Earlier this year violence broke\nout with protesters at a Trump rally in Chicago. And one protester was sucker-\npunched at a Trump rally in Fayetteville. \"You hope (the firebombing) is an\nisolated incident,\" said Ferrel Guillory, a political analyst at UNC Chapel\nHill. \"It always happens that toward the end of the campaign, emotions get\nboth frayed and intensified.\" The Rev. William J. Barber, president of the\nNorth Carolina NAACP, condemned the act. Barber told the Associated Press,\n\"While vigorous debate on issues is acceptable, we in the NAACP denounce any\nkind of violence that is perpetrated toward our citizens or any political\nparty.\" Woodhouse said he's sending an advisory to county Republican offices\nacross the state warning them to take extra caution. Anyone with information\nis asked to call the police department's tip line at 919-732-3975. The\n(Raleigh) News &amp; Observer's Chris Cioffi and The Associated Press\ncontributed.

The cop, who only goes by John Doe Smith, was\nshot in the head and through the intestine during the attack that claimed two\npolice lives and wounded several others. He blamed Black Lives Matter for\ntheir presence on the scene \"inciting violence\" to cause Gavin to snipe the\ncops, and sought damages to the tune of $75,000 for his surgery bills. The\nthing is… Black Lives Matter is a movement, not a specified group of people or\na business. So there's really no one in particular to sue. According to\n[TMZ](http://www.tmz.com/2017/09/28/black-lives-matter-off-hook-cop-lawsuit-\ninjury/), the judge ultimately dismissed the case due to the fact that BLM is\na social movement, and McKesson as an individual was only using his first\namendment right by appearing at the protest -- not inciting anyone to commit\nany acts of violence. It's truly unfortunate what happened to his officer, but\nyou can't blame the peaceful protestors on the scene exercising their rights\nfor the reckless actions of one disturbed individual.

            "input": "The FBI is advising people to hang up if they receive a call from a woman\nscreaming for help. A decades-old [virtual kidnapping scam is placing more\nU.S. residents at risk of becoming potential\nvictims](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/virtual-kidnapping), the FBI warned\non its website. The scheme takes many forms, but basically callers trick\nvictims into paying ransoms to free family or friends who have been\n\"kidnapped.\" The virtual abductors coerce victims to pay a ransom before\nvictims can find out that no one has been kidnapped. The FBI had been tracking\nvirtual kidnapping calls primarily from prisons in Mexico between 2013 and\n2015. The callers targeted individuals who spoke Spanish, the FBI said. Most\nof the victims were from the Los Angeles and Houston areas. The FBI issued the\nwarning because kidnappers have widened their pool of potential victims by no\nlonger targeting only specific individuals and Spanish speakers. The callers\nalso are cold-calling numbers in various cities. In a recent investigation,\nthe FBI found that more than 80 people have fallen victim to the new tactics\nin California, Minnesota, Idaho and Texas. Those victims paid more than\n$87,000 in ransom. An FBI spokeswoman for the Kansas City offices said she was\nnot aware of any instances that have occurred in Kansas or Missouri where the\nFBI was involved. The scam works this way: The potential victim answers a call\nand hears a woman screaming, \"Help me!\" The victim might blurt out a name,\nlike Mary, asking her if she's OK. At that point, the caller will tell the\nvictim that Mary has been kidnapped and she will be harmed if ransom isn't\npaid quickly. The scam is successful when victims don't know the whereabouts\nof their loved ones. The scammers typically demand that the ransoms are wired\nto Mexico. The amount is typically less than $2,000 because of legal\nrestrictions for wiring larger amounts across the border, the FBI said.\nHowever, two victims in Houston were coerced to pay larger ransoms by making\nmoney drops. A federal grand jury charged a 34-year-old Houston woman in July\nwith 10 counts, including wire fraud and money laundering, for her involvement\nin the scam. The charges are the first federal indictment in a virtual\nkidnapping case, the FBI said. Robert A.

(Courtesy of\nthe Oklahoma DOC) OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) -- An Oklahoma man has been arrested\nafter attempting to detonate a vehicle bomb parked outside a downtown Oklahoma\nCity bank. Jerry Drake Varnell, of Sayre, was arrested August 12 in Oklahoma\nCity. Court documents show that at 1 a.m. 23-year-old Varnell attempted to\ndetonate what he believed was a van loaded with explosives parked in an alley\nnext to BancFirst, 101 N. Broadway. Court documents show that the FBI learned\nof Varnell's plot in December 2016 after being notified by a confidential\ninformant of his plot to \"bomb the Federal Reserve Building in Washington D.C.\nin a manner similar to the Oklahoma City Bombing.\" The informant later told\nVarnell that they had access to anhydrous ammonia and ammonium nitrate. The\ntwo then began collecting items to develop an explosive device. In May 2017,\nVarnell allegedly told the informant he wanted to target BancFirst in downtown\nOklahoma City instead because \"I don't wanna kill a bunch of people\". Court\nrecords show that Varnell admitted to \"holding 3 percent ideology\" during a\nmeeting with the informant. \"Varnell expressed a desire to start the new\nrevolution. His targets included institutions with affiliation to the U.S.\nGovernment in Washington D.C.\" FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Raul\nBujanda said. The DOJ reports that Varnell continued to advance his plans to\nbuild a device and had a statement ready to be posted to social media\nfollowing the explosion. On August 11, Varnell met with an undercover FBI\nemployee that was posing as the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia. The two\nthen drove to a mini-storage unit in El Reno and began constructing the\ndevice. All of the items used to construct the bomb were inert and provided by\nthe undercover employee. Varnell then allegedly drove the van with the device\nto an alley by BancFirst and left on foot. The undercover employee picked up\nVarnell and the two drove a short distance away. Court records show that\nVarnell used a \"burner\" cell phone to dial a number to detonate the bomb\nseveral times. He was then arrested by FBI agents. The FBI reports that that\nmonitored Varnell closely during the months-long plot. He has been charged\nwith attempting to use explosives to destroy a building in interstate\ncommerce. Varnell was arraigned in federal court Monday afternoon. The U.S.\nAttorney's Office plans to seek indictment from the grand jury within 30 days.\nIf convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison. United States Attorney Mark\nYancey and FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda spoke to the\nmedia Monday to discuss the arrest. Major Bill Weaver with the Oklahoma City\nPolice Department says Varnell's plan was derailed thanks to a concerned\ncitized and a committed group of law enforcement. \"This goes to show what\nhappens when someone that sees something says something and then law\nenforcement works forward to interdict that threat,\" Weaver said. BancFirst\nhas released the following statement on the incident: BancFirst has been\nworking cooperatively with the FBI. At no time were employees, customers or\nthe general public ever in any danger. We believe our BancFirst downtown\nOklahoma City building was a random and convenient selection by the suspect.\nThere is no further threat or reason for concern. We take comfort and our\ncompany embraces a deep appreciation and admiration for the men and women of\nthe FBI for their diligent and dedicated work in protecting our nation.\n[](https://www.adplugg.com/track/click/A48212425/23793/click?hn=okcfox.com&bu=%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Ffbi-\nman-arrested-after-attempting-to-detonate-vehicle-bomb-outside-downtown-okc-\nbank&rf=&zn=7972&pm=3395)\n\n",

I\nhappen to be one of them,\" Trump said. Offering no proof, the Republican\nnominee posited that Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, had\nbribed Lynch with the position when the two had an impromptu meeting earlier\nthis summer on a plane in Arizona. The two met just days before the FBI\ncompleted its probe into the private email server. \"Perhaps, just perhaps, of\ncourse he said he only talked about golf and the grandchildren, but he was on\nthe plane for 39 minutes, he went to Arizona, an unbelievable place, but there\nare those who think when he went onto the plane that's what he discussed just\nprior to a decision being made,\" Trump said. The New York real estate mogul\nthen trained his biting attacks on Abedin and her husband, former Democratic\nCongressman Anthony Weiner. The emails tied to the Clinton probe were found on\nthe separated couple's electronic devices from a separate FBI investigation\ninto Weiner's sexting scandal. \"Did I call him correctly, did anybody see?\"\nTrump asked, pointing to his prior criticisms of Weiner. \"It's called good\njudgement, it's called good instincts. If you check out the tweets, or if you\ncheck out whatever it is I wrote about him, it is so perfect, I said. And that\nwas done a long time ago, but they found, by looking at Anthony Weiner, a\nmajor, major, major sleaze, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing\nand deleted emails.\" Trump has, in the past, wondered whether Abedin was a\nnational security concern because of her relationship to Weiner. \"[Abedin's]\nreceiving very, very important information and giving it to Hillary. Who else\nis she giving it to?\" Trump said back in August. \"Her husband has serious\nproblems and on top of that, he now works for a public relations firm...So how\ncan she be married to this guy who's got these major problems? She's getting\nher most important information, it could be, in the world. Who knows what he's\ngoing to do with it? Forget about her.\" Trump's speculation on what the newly\nsurfaced emails contained, however, remains unfounded. The FBI has yet to\nrelease any further details about the information found in the emails.\nClinton's campaign, in the meantime, has defended Abedin, with campaign chair\nJohn Podesta telling reporters on a conference call that the staff stands\nbehind her. \"There's no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, no\nindication that this was even about Hillary,\" Podesta said Saturday. He added\nthat Comey's letter to top Republicans in the House and Senate was \"long on\ninnuendo and short on facts.\" Podesta added that Comey knew \"full well what\nRepublicans in Congress would do with it\" and blasted House Oversight\nCommittee Chair Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in particular for taking \"the\nopportunity to distort the facts.\" CBS News' Hannah Fraser-Chanpong\ncontributed to this report.\n\n",

Daniel Richman, with whom Comey shared at least one memo -- the\ncontents of which Richman shared with New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt\n-- said President Trump was simply wrong. \"No memo was given to me that was\nmarked 'classified,'\" Daniel Richman told CNN. \"No memo was passed on to the\nTimes.\" Richman did share the contents of one memo, he said, but \"the\nsubstance of the memo passed on to the Times was not marked classified and to\nmy knowledge remains unclassified.\" During Senate testimony in June, in which\nhe said he gave memos to someone he described as a Columbia University\nprofessor, Comey said he specifically wrote the memos to avoid including\nclassified information. \"My thinking was, if I write it in such a way that I\ndon't include anything that would trigger a classification, that'll make it\neasier for us to discuss, within the FBI and the government, and to -- to hold\non to it in a way that makes it accessible to us,\" Comey told senators. On\nSunday, writing in The Hill, John Solomon reported that, \"More than half of\nthe memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote as personal recollections of\nhis conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have\nbeen determined to contain classified information, according to interviews\nwith officials familiar with the documents.\" CNN has not independently\nverified The Hill's report. The Hill's reporting raised \"the possibility,\"\nSolomon reported, that \"Comey broke his own agency's rules and ignored the\nsame security protocol\" that Comey criticized Hillary Clinton for\ndisregarding. Solomon did not report that the possible breaking of FBI rules\nwas determined to have happened, nor did he report that this would be a\nviolation of the law. Yet that is how President Trump depicted it in a tweet\nMonday morning: \"James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That\nis so illegal!\" One of the issues at play may have to do with whether any\ncontents of the Comey memos have since been upgraded to classified, although\nthat has not been definitively reported by CNN.

That's the whole premise of The Good\nWife, sort of. That's not true of every wife, however. After all of the\naccusations against Harvey Weinstein that have come out into the open and been\nmade public, Georgina Chapman is parting ways with the former big-name studio\nexecutive after ten years of marriage.  Considering that Harvey Weinstein has\nbeen fired from his own company \\-- the Weinstein Company -- it's not all that\nsurprising that his wife is taking drastic steps, too. After these kinds of\nallegations, it would be hard to understand anyone who wouldn't put some\ndistance between themselves and the accused. First came the Harvey Weinstein\nsexual harassment accusations in a New York Times expose. After decades of\nrumors, the biggest surprise wasn't the nature of the accusations so much as\nthat the article was actually published. A lot of the times, powerful people\npull strings and call in favors to make problems go away. Some of the\nallegations were creepy but not damning -- stories about him promising young\nactresses that he'd boost their careers if they did certain things for him.\nThat's gross, but there are situations (clearly not involving Weinstein) where\nboth parties might consent to that sort of arrangement in a way that would\nbenefit everyone. The other accusations that came out in that same expose --\nabout coercing women to drink and watch him shower, about pulling out his\npenis without invitation and masturbating before an unwilling audience -- were\nbeyond just creepy. Some of those things are crimes and none of them are okay.\nThings looked bleak for Harvey Weinstein, and he was condemned by major names\nin Hollywood. But accusations sexual misconduct is something that a lot of\npowerful men can and do somehow get past Hell, some people who are accused of\nsexual assault and also famously recorded bragging about it go on to become\nPresident. Men with money can get away with a lot. Then, yesterday, the New\nYorker released more -- allegations of Harvey Weinstein committing sexual\nassault again and again and again. A number of actresses came forward as\naccusers, and his is now accused of outright rape. Suddenly, his powerful\nformer friends are returning his donations but not his calls. Weinstein's\ncareer is almost certainly history at this point. And so, it seems, is his\nmarriage.  Georgina Chapman is a British actress and designer. Now 41, she\nmarried Harvey Weinstein in 2007. The couple has two children together: India\nPearl, who is 7 years old, and Dashiell Max Robert, who is 4. In a statement\nto People, Georgina Chapman reveals that [she and Harvey Weinstein are\nseparating](http://people.com/movies/harvey-weinstein-wife-georgina-chapman-\nseparating/). \"My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous\npain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband.\nCaring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for\nprivacy at this time.\" We've seen a number of extremely bad takes on Harvey\nWeinstein since this story began to break, but his wife's statement is exactly\non point. First, she expresses sympathy for his victims. Second, she makes it\nclear that sexual assault is unforgivable -- which it is. Third, she announces\nthat she's leaving Harvey Weinstein. And fourth, she emphasizes that she's\nputting her children first, which is what every parent should always, always\ndo.  Rose McGowan is naming names, exposing people whom she claims knew about\nWeinstein's pattern of predatory behavior and either did nothing or\nparticipated in the cover-up. (Honestly, bless Rose McGowan for having zero\nchill about anything, ever) Harvey Weinstein already seems like he's toast,\nbut it could cost others -- possibly even Ben Affleck -- his career. Something\ntells us that there are more accusations against Harvey Weinstein out there\nthat just haven't come to light yet. Things looked bleak for Harvey Weinstein,\nand he was condemned by major names in Hollywood. But accusations sexual\nmisconduct is something that a lot of powerful men can and do somehow get past\nHell, some people who are accused of sexual assault and also famously recorded\nbragging about it go on to become President.

Their pledge was closely followed by the Paradigm Research\nGroup, a campaign organisation set up by Steve Bassett, the only registered\nlobbyist on the UFO issue in the US. Mr Bassett has been calling for an end to\nan alleged \"truth embargo\" that he and other UFO enthusiasts believe was put\nin place by global government to hide the truth about aliens visiting earth\nfrom the public since the infamous 1947 Roswell UFO incident in New Mexico.\nBut, now Mr Bassett is hoping Hillary Clinton and Mr Podesta can still\ninfluence incumbent President Barack Obama to disclose the files and reveal\nthe truth before he leaves office in Janaury.  A statement on the PRG website\nsays: \"There are 70 days left to persuade Secretary Clinton, John Podesta and\nPresident Obama to engage the media on the extraterrestrial issue leading to a\nWhite House/Pentagon rapprochement and Disclosure under President Obama.\" In\nJanuary, Mrs Clinton said she also wanted to open up on what is happening at\nthe mysterious Area 51 military base in Nevada, where UFO conspiracists\nbelieve evidence of alien technology is hidden away. Clinton claimed she would\n\"get to the bottom\" once and for all of questions and controversy over what\nthe US Government does or does not know about the mysterious subject.\nResponding to questions about UFOs from a reporter during an election\ninterview in New Hampshire, she said: \"Yes, I am going to get to the bottom of\nit.\" Clinton even admitted that she realises Earth may have actually been\nvisited by extraterrestrials. Clinton and husband former president Bill\nClinton have allegedly tried to force disclosure of UFO files before, but even\nwhen the latter was in the White House it did not fully happen. Bill Clinton\nmet billionaire Laurance Rockefeller at his ranch in Wyoming in 1995 where\nthey held discussions on the \"Rockefeller Initiative\" to secure release of all\npreviously classified UFO files. In 2007, Mrs Clinton acknowledged that among\nthe top freedom of information (FOI) requests her husband received as\npresident were requests related to UFO and alien disclosure.

We don't know for sure.\"\nIn 2014 her Mr Podesta said his biggest regret during his time as top adviser\nto President Obama was not securing release of classified UFO files. Other\nalien hunters are now banking on President elect Donald Truth to unlock the\nfiles. UFO blogger Scott C waring said: \"Will Trump reveal UFO info to the\npublic, or will he skirt this issue?\"\n\n",

About 5% of the island's population is Muslim, or about 60,000\npeople. The indications are that Caribbean-wide ISIS recruitment was around\n150 people, up from 100 the prior year. In reality, the \"threat\" here is much\nless about Trinidad not having a globe-hopping military, than that ISIS isn't\nmaking such a big deal about recruits coming to Syria anymore, and is instead\npressing them to launch attacks at home. This is particularly problematic for\nthe US because many Caribbean islands are popular tourist destinations, and\nAmerican tourists are a likely target. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz\n\n",

Obama will take the stage 12 years after he first came to\nnational attention as a freshman senator from Illinois at his party's 2004\nconvention. Ostensibly, Obama was there to endorse Massachusetts senator John\nKerry for his White House bid. But it's best remembered as the launching-point\nof Obama's own run four years later. John Kerry believes in America. And he\nknows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper, for alongside our\nfamous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga, a\nbelief that we're all connected as one people. If there is a child on the\nSouth Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my\nchild. If there is a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their\nprescription drugs and are having to choose between medicine and the rent,\nthat makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there is an\nArab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due\nprocess, that threatens my civil liberties. It is that fundamental belief --\nit is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's\nkeeper -- that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our\nindividual dreams, and yet still come together as one American family. \"E\npluribus unum;\" \"out of many, one.\" Now even as we speak, there are those who\nare preparing to divide us; the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who\nembrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is\nnot a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States\nof America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino\nAmerica and Asian America. There's the United States of America. The pundits\n-- the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue\nstates, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got\nnews for them, too: we worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't\nlike federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach\nlittle league in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the\nred states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are\npatriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging\nallegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of\nAmerica. In the end -- in the end -- in the end, that's what this election is\nabout. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a\npolitics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to\nhope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the almost willful ignorance\nthat thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it, or a\nhealth care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm\ntalking about. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of\nslaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants\nsetting out for distant shores. The hope of a young Naval lieutenant bravely\npatrolling the Mekong Delta. The hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy\nthe odds. The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America\nhas a place for him too. ( Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the\nface of uncertainty. The audacity of hope. In the end, that is God's greatest\ngift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen; a belief\nthat there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class\nrelief, and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we\ncan provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young\npeople in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we\nhave a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of\nhistory, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\nAmerica, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same\nurgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the\nsame hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt\nthat all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine,\nthe people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as\npresident, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this\ncountry will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness, a\nbrighter day will come.

Three people\nwere arrested: a 40-year-old man for obstruction, a 37-year-old man for\nassault and a 25-year old man for assault. Council member Mike O'Brien\nexpressed frustration over the crowd being kept away from Westlake Park. \"Why\nweren't the demonstrators not allowed to get to Westlake Park?\" O'Brien said.\n\"I don't know what the call was. I'm not in a position to second-guess that at\nthe moment.\" Demonstrations respond nationwide in wake of Charlottesville\nSeattle was just one of the cities in the United States on Sunday that had\nprotesters decrying hate and racism. In Charlottesville over the weekend, neo-\nNazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists gathered\nto \"take America back\" and oppose plans to remove a Confederate statue in the\nVirginia college town, and hundreds of other people came to protest the rally.\nThe groups clashed in street brawls, with hundreds of people throwing punches,\nhurling water bottles and beating each other with sticks and shields.\nEventually, a car rammed into a peaceful crowd of anti-white-nationalist\nprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. A Virginia State Police\nhelicopter deployed in a large-scale response to the violence then crashed\ninto the woods outside of town. Both troopers on board died. President Donald\nTrump condemned what he called an \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and\nviolence on many sides,\" a statement that Democrats and some of the\npresident's fellow Republicans saw as equivocating about who was to blame. The\nWhite House later added that the condemnation \"includes white Supremacists,\nKKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\" Some of the white nationalists at\nSaturday's rally cited Trump's victory, after a campaign of racially charged\nrhetoric, as validation for their beliefs. Some of the people protesting\nSunday also point to the president and his campaign, saying they gave license\nto racist hatred that built into what happened in Charlottesville.

            "input": "It used to be pretty easy to tell the difference between advertising and\neditorial content on Facebook. If a post had a little \"sponsored\" label on it,\nthat was a red flag telling you, \"Hey, a brand paid for this, you should treat\nit as an advertisement.\" But that line has gotten blurrier for Facebook users,\nespecially over the last few months as Facebook has limited how far posts from\nmedia companies can spread on their own (so-called \"organic reach\"). In\nJanuary, Facebook announced that it would de-emphasize publisher content in\nfavor of \" [friends and\nfamily](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571)\" posts. One of\nthe main complaints I heard from folks on the publisher side was that Mark\nZuckerberg didn't actually want less publisher content on Facebook: He wanted\npublishers to pay him to help their articles spread. \"Facebook is now pay to\nplay,\" was a lament I heard many times. And that is what many publishers -\nfrom The New Yorker, to The Wall Street Journal, to Marie Claire (and Business\nInsider) - have been doing for certain articles, with more frequency since the\nalgorithm change. They have paid Facebook to help their editorial,\njournalistic articles spread. The Facebook posts that link to these articles\nare labeled \"sponsored,\" because they are technically ads, but they link to\nnormal news articles. When you follow the link to the publisher's website, the\narticle isn't a piece of \"sponsored content,\" even though the Facebook post is\nlabeled \"sponsored.\" Confusing, right? But that's only the start of the rabbit\nhole when it comes to the blurring of the lines between advertising and\neditorial content on Facebook. Traditionally, media companies have worked to\nseparate advertisements from journalistic writing (and to properly label\n\"advertorial\" content). But in the world of Facebook, these outlets don't\nalways even have control over how posts appear to readers. Positive articles\nabout companies like Uber (for instance) are being turned into promotional\nads, sometimes without the media organizations being made aware. It can be\nhard for readers to wade through, so we decided to break it down for you in a\nway that is easy to digest. We'll walk you through the various types of\n\"sponsored\" posts on Facebook and what they mean. When the outlet pays to\nspread it Let's start with the one I just mentioned: Purely editorial articles\nthat are being promoted with \"sponsored\" posts on Facebook. This basically\nhappens when a publisher wants to boost an article it thinks has viral\npotential, and can bring the publisher in much more advertising (or\nsubscriber) revenue than it is paying Facebook to push it into your feed, or\nget new readers. Here is what that looks like from The New Yorker on an\neditorial article titled \" [The Great Sadness of Ben\nAffleck](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/the-great-\nsadness-of-ben-affleck)\": Nathan McAlone/Facebook And here's one from The Wall\nStreet Journal on an editorial article titled \" [Silicon Valley to Washington:\nWhy Don't You Get Us](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-to-\nwashington-why-dont-you-get-us-1523451203)\": Nathan McAlone/Facebook Just\nscrolling through my Facebook feed casually, I noticed many such articles from\noutlets ranging from those above to Marie Claire (as mentioned), Ranker,\nScreen Rant, Elite Daily, U.S. News and World Report, and so on. They really\nrun the gamut editorially. Okay, so this type of post is easy enough to\nunderstand. When the subject pays to spread it Here is where it starts to get\nmore confusing. Sometimes, the subject of an article pays Facebook to promote\nan editorial article written about them - presumably one that paints them in a\npositive light. These are also technically \"ads\" on Facebook, but the\njournalism they are promoting was not paid for by the subject. The article\nitself is not \"sponsored content,\" even though the Facebook post is\n\"sponsored.\" Here's an example with Uber and CNET: CNET wrote this article\nabout Uber's new CEO, titled \" [Uber's U-turn: How the new CEO is cleaning\nhouse after scandals and lawsuits](https://www.cnet.com/news/ubers-u-turn-how-\nceo-dara-khosrowshahi-is-cleaning-up-after-scandals-and-lawsuits/).\" To be\nclear, this was written by a reporter at CNET and was not paid for by Uber.\nIt's just a regular news article. But Uber clearly liked the piece and is now\npaying Facebook to spread it far and wide. Here is an example from the video\nworld. This [editorial video (not an ad) by NowThis\nMoney](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/money/you-choose-the-charity-when-you-\nbuy-this-streetwear) is being promoted by the subject of the video, Adam\nKhafif. Adam Khafif's Facebook page is sharing a NowThis Money post from its\nFacebook page, and that share is being \"sponsored\" (i.e. boosted by paying\nmoney to Facebook). See, it gets very convoluted. But the main point is that\nthe underlying video, and in this case even the underlying original Facebook\npost, isn't an ad - but the subject of the video is paying for a \"sponsored\"\nFacebook post to promote it. Sometimes these \"sponsored\" posts are even geo-\ntargeted, like the one on this article from The New Yoker titled \" [Divinity\non the Dance Floor](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/divinity-on-\nthe-dance-floor),\" which is being \"promoted\" not even by its subject (DJ\nRobert Hood), but by the nightclub where he performs regularly (\n[Schimanski](https://www.schimanskinyc.com/)): When the outlet pays an\ninfluencer to spread it Now let's get to influencers and celebrities.\nSometimes publishers pay influencers (people with big Facebook followings) to\npromote their articles. This used to be done a lot through organic Facebook\nreach ( [here's an article on this about George\nTakei](https://theoutline.com/post/2491/when-publishers-get-paid-for-\npromoting-narratives-george-takei-influencers?zd=1&zi=xsbdje6y).) But now I've\nonly seen it recently in the form of \"sponsored\" posts. Here's an example from\nSnoop Dogg and FashionBeans: Snoop Dogg in this instance is technically paying\nFacebook to promote an article from FashionBeans, [titled \"Here Are The Most\nObnoxiously Rich Suburbs Of America's Biggest\nCities](http://www.fashionbeans.com/content/here-are-the-most-obnoxiously-\nrich-suburbs-of-americas-biggest-cities),\" that really has nothing to do with\nhim. But most likely what is happening is that FashionBeans is paying him to\npromote it, then he is paying Facebook. So the idea is that while FashionBeans\ncould directly pay Facebook to promote the post, the promotion is more\neffective (dollar for dollar) if Snoop Dogg's name is attached. When an\nadvertiser pays for the actual article Now we get to the last category: actual\n\"sponsored content\" from a media company. This is an instance of\n\"advertorial,\" where the advertiser is directly paying the media company to\nsponsor the actual article itself. Here's an example from BuzzFeed and NBC\nSports: In these cases, the word \"with\" is usually employed in the Facebook\npost to denote which company is paying for the underlying content. It's marked\nagain if you follow the link to BuzzFeed's site: Notice that the \"Brand\nPublisher\" is NBC Sports. So this is actually an ad - not only on Facebook but\non BuzzFeed's site as well. And there you have it, we've come to the end of\nour guide to understanding who is paying to get journalism or advertising in\nfront of you on Facebook. One last thing to remember is that no matter who is\npaying for a \"sponsored\" Facebook post - outlet, subject, or influencer - if\nyou check the actual article after following the link, it should clearly mark\nwhether the article is an advertisement or a journalistic piece.

Speaking to CBS in his first major interview since being elected\nMr Trump said: \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal\nand have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these\npeople, probably two million - it could be even three million - we are getting\nthem out of the country or we are going to incarcerate.\" Collins, attempting\nto understand why the Mexican woman was so pleased about Mr Trump's election\nsuccess, said: \"Was he saying something that lots of people think but are too\nscared to say?\" Josephine said: \"Yes, and another thing is that I love the\npeople that are here that I know, I know many people that are Asians, that are\nArabs, good speaking English people, but there are very few. \"The most people\nin the area don't want to mix, and they are very hostile. \"Everything has been\ntwisted.

            "input": "As the New Year 5778 begins, 88% of Israeli Jews say that they are happy and\nsatisfied with their lives. This makes sense. Israel's relative security, its\nprosperity, freedom, and spiritual blossoming make Israeli Jews the most\nsuccessful Jewish community in 3,500 years of Jewish history. The same cannot\nbe said for the Jews of the Diaspora. In Western Europe, Jewish communities\nthat just a generation ago were considered safe and prosperous are now\nbesieged. Synagogues and Jewish schools look like army barracks. And the\nsevere security cordons Jews need to pass through to pray and study are\nentirely justified. For where they are absent, as they were at the Hyper\nCacher Jewish supermarket in Paris in 2015, assailants strike. Western\nEuropean Jewry's crisis is exogenous to the Jewish communities. It isn't the\nJews who caused the crisis, which may in time cause the wholesale exodus of\nthe Jews from Europe. The crisis is a function of growing levels of popular\nantisemitism spurred by mass immigration from the Islamic world and the\nresurgence of indigenous European Jew-hatred, particularly on the far Left.\nThis is not the situation among American Jewry, which at the dawn of 5778 also\nfinds itself steeped in an ever-deepening crisis. And while antisemitism is a\ngrowing problem in America, particularly on university campuses, unlike their\nEuropean counterparts, American Jews could mount and win a battle against the\ngrowing anti-Jewish forces. But in large part, they have chosen not to. And\nthey have chosen not to fight the anti-Semites because they are in the midst\nof a self-induced identity crisis. First, there is the problem of demographic\ncollapse. According to the Pew Research Center's 2013 study of American Jewry,\nnearly 60% of American Jews intermarry. Based on the Pew data, the Jewish\nPeople Policy Institute published a report in June that noted that not only\nare 60% of American Jews who get married marrying non-Jews, only half of\nAmerican Jews are getting married at all. And among those who are getting\nmarried, less than a third are raising their children as Jewish in some way.\nEarlier this month, a study of American Jews was published by the Public\nReligion Research Institute. It found that not only hasn't the situation\nimproved since the Pew survey was published, the trend toward assimilation and\nloss of Jewish identity among American Jews has accelerated. In 2013, 32% of\nAmerican Jews under 30 said that they were not Jews by religion. Today the\nproportion of Jews under 30 who say they have no relation to the Jewish faith\nhas ballooned to 47%. Not surprisingly, the wholesale abandonment of Jewish\nfaith by nearly half of young American Jews has taken a toll on the two\nliberal streams of American Judaism. According to the study, the percentage of\nAmerican Jews who identify as Reform or Conservative Jews is in free fall.\nWhereas in 2013, 35% of American Jews identified as Reform, today, a mere four\nyears later, only 28% identify as Reform. The situation among Conservatives is\neven worse. In 2013, 18% of American Jews identified as Conservatives. Today,\nonly 14% do. Among Jews, under 30 the situation is even starker. Only 20% of\nAmerican Jews under 30 identify as Reform. Only 8% identify as Conservative.\nTo be sure, the trend toward secularism and assimilation among US Jewry is not\nnew. And over the years, Reform and Conservative leaders have adopted varying\nstrategies to deal with it. In 1999 the Reform movement tried to deal with the\nproblem by strengthening the movement's religious practices. Although the\neffort failed, the impulse that drove the strategy was rational. American Jews\nwho seek spiritual and religious meaning likely want more than a sermon about\nTikkun Olam. The problem is that they also want more than a rabbi donning a\nkippa and a synagogue choosing to keep kosher. This is why, as the number of\nReform and Conservative Jews is contracting, the number of American Jews who\nassociate with the Orthodox movement is growing. Between 2013 and 2017, the\nproportion of young American Jews who identify as Orthodox grew from 10% to\n15%. Moreover, more and more American Jews are finding their spiritual home\nwith Chabad. Today there are more Chabad houses in the US than Reform\nsynagogues. Unable to compete for Jews seeking religious fulfillment, the\nReform and Conservative movements have struck out for new means of rallying\ntheir bases and attracting members. Over the past year, two new strategies are\ndominating the public actions of both movements. First, there is a selective\nfight against antisemitism. While antisemitism is experiencing a growth spurt\nin the US progressive movement, and antisemitism is becoming increasingly\novert in US Muslim communities, neither the Reform nor Conservative movements\nhave taken significant institutional steps to fight them. Instead, both\nmovements, and a large swath of the Jewish institutional world, led in large\npart by Reform and Conservative Jews, have either turned a blind eye to this\nantisemitism or supported it. Take for instance the case of Davis, California,\nimam Amman Shahin. $107 Billion Treasure Found From WW2! You Won't Believe\nWhere It Was Stashed On July 21 Shahin gave a sermon calling for the Jewish\npeople to be annihilated. His Jewish neighbors in the progressive Jewish\ncommunities of Davis and Sacramento didn't call the police and demand that he\nbe investigated for terrorist ties. They didn't demand that his mosque fire\nhim. Instead, led by the Oakland Jewish Federation, local rabbi Seth\nCastleman, and the JCRC, they embraced Shahin. They appeared with him at a\npublic \"apology\" ceremony, where he failed to apologize for calling for his\nJewish colleagues, and every other Jew, to be murdered. All Shahin did express\nregret that his call for genocide caused offense. On the other hand, the same\nleaders stand as one against allegations of antisemitic violence stemming from\nthe political Right. In the face of an utter lack of evidence, when Jewish\ninstitutions were subjected to a rash of bomb threats last winter, Reform and\nConservative leaders led the charge insisting that far-right antisemites were\nbehind them and insinuated that the perpetrators supported President Donald\nTrump. When it worked out that all of the threats were carried out by a\nmentally ill Israeli Jew, they never issued an apology. So, too, the Reform\nand Conservative movements, like the rest of the American Jewish community,\ntreated the Charlottesville riot last month like a new Reichstag fire. They\nentirely ignored the violence of the far-left, antisemitic Antifa protesters\nand behaved as though tomorrow neo-Nazis would take control of the federal\ngovernment. They jumped on the bandwagon insisting that Trump's initial\ncondemnation of both groups was proof that he has a soft spot for neo-Nazis.\nThe problem with the strategy of selective outrage over antisemitism is that\nit isn't at all clear who the target audience is. Survey data shows that the\nmore active Jews are in the synagogue, the less politically radical they are\nand the more devoted to Jewish causes they are. So it is hard to see how\nturning a blind eye to leftist and Muslim antisemitism will rally their\ncurrent membership more than they already have been rallied. Moreover, the\nmore radicalized Jews become politically, the more outlets they have for their\npolitical activism both as Jews and as leftists. No matter how anti-Trump\nConservative and Reform leaders become, they can never rival the progressive\nforces in the Democratic Party. Prospects for success of the second strategy\nare arguably even lower. The second strategy involves cultivating animosity\ntoward Israel over the issue of egalitarian prayer at the Kotel. Last June,\nthe government overturned an earlier decision to build a passageway connecting\nthe Western Wall Plaza with Robinson's Arch, along with the Southern Wall,\nwhere egalitarian prayer services are held. The government also rescinded a\nprevious decision to have representatives of the Conservative and Reform\nmovements receive membership in the committee that manages the Western Wall\nPlaza. The government's first decision was non-political. The Antiquities\nAuthority nixed the construction of the passage due to the adverse impact\nconstruction would have on the antiquities below the surface. As to the second\ndecision, it is far from a matter of life and death. The committee has no\npower to influence egalitarian prayers for better or for worse. And yet,\nrather than acknowledge that the decision was a setback but it didn't harm the\nstatus of egalitarian prayer at the Wall, the Reform and Conservative\nmovements declared war against the government and dragged much of the\norganized Jewish establishment behind them. The Reform leadership canceled a\nscheduled meeting with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Jewish\nAgency Board followed suit. Six hundred Conservative rabbis signed a letter to\nNetanyahu accusing him of betraying Diaspora Jewry and announcing they would\nbe forced to reconsider their support for Israel. Ambassador David Friedman,\nwho had just taken residence in Israel a month before the explosion, used his\nfirst public remarks as ambassador to call his fellow American Jews to order.\nFriedman said, \"Yesterday, I heard something that I thought I'd never heard\nbefore. And I understand the source of the frustration and the source of the\nanger. But I heard a major Jewish organization say that they needed to rethink\ntheir support for the State of Israel. \"That's something unthinkable in my\nlifetime, up until yesterday. We have to do better. We must do better,\" he\nsaid. But in the intervening months, the Conservative and Reform movements\nhave not relented in their attacks. They have ratcheted them up. The thinking\nappears to be that if they can make this problem look like a life or death\nstruggle between Israel and progressive Jewry, they can both keep their\ndwindling bases engaged and attract members of the increasingly anti-Israel\nJewish far Left. The problem with this is that just as they cannot outdo the\nDemocratic Party in their hostility toward Trump, so the Conservative and\nReform movements cannot be more anti-Israel than Jewish Voices for Peace and\nother anti-Israel Jewish groups. The question for Israelis is what this\nfailure of the mainstream American Jewish leadership means for the future of\nIsrael's relationship with American Jewry. Jewish survival and continuity\nthrough the ages have been predicated and dependent on our ability as Jews to\nuphold the commandment of the sages that all Jews are responsible for one\nanother. As the most successful Jewish community in history, Israel has a\nspecial responsibility for our brethren in the Diaspora. The first step toward\nfulfilling our duty is to recognize the basic fact that while it is true that\nthe American Jewish community is in crisis, the leaders of that community are\nin an even deeper crisis. And the key to strengthening and supporting the\ncommunity is to bypass its failed leadership and speak and interact directly\nwith American Jews.

In\nTrump's [first speech to Congress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/02/28/remarks-president-trump-joint-address-congress), he claimed\n\"the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related\noffenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.\" That is a flat-out\nlie that earned Trump \" [four\nPinocchios](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-\nchecker/wp/2017/08/15/president-trumps-claim-that-foreigners-comprise-the-\nvast-majority-of-terrorism-convictions-since-911/?utm_term=.85b923c1bb37)\" --\nthe most dishonest rating given by fact checkers at Washington Post.

In fact, as [New America points\nout](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/who-are-\nterrorists/): \"None of the deadly attackers since 9/11 emigrated or came from\na family that emigrated from one of these countries nor were any of the 9/11\nattackers from the listed countries. Eight of the lethal attackers were born\nAmerican citizens.\" This is not to deny that there have been deadly attacks\nsince 9/11 that have been inspired by jihadism and foreign terror groups. The\ndeadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history prior to the Las Vegas killings\ntook place in June 2016, when [Omar Mateen, an ISIS-inspired terrorist who was\nan American-born citizen of Afghan\ndescent](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-mass-shooting-\nterrorism-islam), opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida,\nmurdering 49 people and injuring another 53. Nor can we ignore the vicious\nattacks carried out by ISIS militants that have killed or injured hundreds of\npeople in England, France and Canada.

In the U.S. however, [more terrorist\nattacks](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/analysis-deadly-threat-far-right-\nextremists-overshadowed-fear-islamic-terrorism/) have been carried out by\nwhite American men than jihadists. Here are a few of those attacks, as\n[highlighted by Vox](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-\nmass-shooting-terrorism-islam): Last Sunday night, October 1, a 64-year-old\nwhite man from Mesquite, Nevada, opened rapid fire on a concert audienceof\nover 22,000 music lovers in Las Vegas. So far 59 people are known to have died\nand over 500 were wounded. In August, a 20-year-old white supremacist from\nOhio plowed his car into a crowd of people protesting the \"Unite the Right\"\nrally, killing Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others. In May, a\n35-year-old white man, Jeremy Joseph Christian from Oregon, screamed anti-\nMuslim threats at two Muslim teenagers on a train in Portland. When two men\nstepped in to protect the young women, [he stabbed them both to\ndeath](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/us/portland-train-attack-muslim-\nrant.html?_r=0) and wounded a third man.

White\nAmerican males are the primary terrorist threat in the U.S. While Trump is\nbusy \"keeping American citizens safe\" by denying innocent Muslims the right to\nenter the U.S., he is also increasing the number of people the U.S. is guilty\nof killing worldwide.

With\nthe Taliban going strong, Trump recently [announced his decision to send more\ntroops to Afghanistan](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-troop-boost-in-\nafghanistan-to-cost-extra-1-billion/). The invasion of Iraq by the U.S. helped\ndestabilize the entire region and lead to the creation of ISIS, which has been\nwaging its brutal war in the Middle East since then.

The Clinton Blame Game: Hillary Needs to\nAccept Responsibility for Loss No compatible source was found for this video.\nBy Brian Brinker; OpsLens: Now that Hillary Clinton is making her way back\ninto the public spotlight, we're starting to hear a lot more about who's to\nblame for her loss. Of course, President Trump is at the top of her list. So\ntoo are members of her campaign staff, pollsters, The New York Times,\nsupporters who didn't show up at the polls, James Comey, Putin and the\nRussians, and various others. You know whose name you're not going to find?\nHillary Clinton's own. Save perhaps for President Trump, no one else is\nsingularly so responsible for her loss than Hillary herself. Yet, she has so\nfar proven unwilling to take any of the blame. As Hillary stated in a recent\ninterview, \"I take responsibility for every decision I make--but that's not\nwhy I lost.\" In other words, the blame doesn't fall on Hillary's shoulders, at\nleast in her mind. However, as the nominee and candidate for president, no one\nelse should have to shoulder as much blame as Hillary. And I say this as\nsomeone who does believe that sexism and other \"unfair\" factors played a role.\nStill, it wasn't sexism that inspired Hillary to ignore voters in Michigan and\nWisconsin and to jet set out to California to meet with rich donors. And it\nwasn't sexism that inspired a largely negative campaign that focused on why\npeople should vote against Donald Trump, rather than why they should vote for\nHillary Clinton. Turns out that her campaign didn't inspire a lot of people to\nthe polls. Sexism may have been a factor in Hillary's inability to connect\nwith voters, especially working and middle class voters. But there were many\nother factors as well. Hillary has a tendency of coming off as an elitist. She\ncan't pour a beer, she hasn't driven a car in years, and she always seemed to\nstruggle to relate to people directly. Her campaign, meanwhile, was mostly\ntone deaf. After winning the DNC nomination, she largely blew off Michigan and\nWisconsin. The problem is that if you want midwestern voters, you have to meet\nwith them and respect them. You can't ignore them and skip off to sunny\nCalifornia to eat triple-digit meals and hob knob with celebrities and\nmillionaires instead. To read rest of article visit OpsLens.\n\n",

The Eurocrats and\ntheir Remain cheerleaders in Britain were only too thrilled when President\nObama arrogantly warned that, in the event of Brexit, we would have to \"get to\nthe back of the queue\" for any future trade deal with the US. Donald Trump's\nvictory has shaken up the world But the arrival of Donald Trump has\ntransformed the landscape. He is far closer to Britain than to Brussels. It is\nthe EU that will have to get to the back of the queue. Tellingly, the first\nEuropean politician that Trump has met since his election was Nigel Farage,\nthe EU's nemesis. The deepening sense of alarm in Brussels was reflected in\nthe decision by the EU's foreign affairs chief, Italian socialist Federica\nMogherini, to summon all the foreign ministers of the member states to a\nspecial dinner last night to discuss the implications of Trump's election. As\none European diplomat admitted at the weekend: \"We would never have held a\nsimilar dinner if Hillary Clinton had been elected. It shows how much we are\npanicking.\" Sensibly our own Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson refused to attend\nthis self-indulgent feast of grief. With his gift for the original phrase, he\nurged EU bosses stop wallowing in their \"collective whinge-o-rama\" and come to\nterms with the democratic verdict of the American people. EU leaders are too\ndeep in their dogma to properly respond to Trump's presidency Yet, in truth,\nthe EU politicians are so manically attached to their federalist dogma that\nthey would not dream of adopting a pragmatic, flexible response to Trump. On\nthe contrary, they will just use Trump's success to push for more central\npower, more integration, more unity. \"The EU should treat his election as a\nwake-up call to take charge of our own destiny,\" says Guy Verhofstadt, the\nBelgian federalist fanatic. The EU will this week discuss plans to impose a\nEuropean defence strategy, complete with its own EU army and military\nheadquarters. It is precisely that kind of federalist megalomania which shows\nwhy Brussels is such a threat to the stability and peace of Europe, a far\ngreater menace than Trump ever could be. Ever since Trump first became a\ncontender for the US presidency there has been a fashionable narrative which\npaints him as a dangerous, ignorant clown who could blow up the western world\nwith his reckless inexperience. But the real risks actually come from smug\nglobalisers such as Hillary Clinton and the EU federalists with their contempt\nfor national sovereignty at home and abroad. The president-elect has a chance\nof establishing peace with Russia It was the EU, filled with an imperialist\nambition to expand its territory, that provoked an incendiary confrontation\nwith Russia over Ukraine, whereas Trump wants co-operation with Putin.\nSimilarly, the western policy of trying to bring down President Assad of Syria\nwith the help of Islamic extremist rebels has only prolonged the civil war\nthere. It will be no surprise if the war ends once Trump takes office,\nenabling Putin and Assad to crush the rebels. In the wake of Trump's victory\nthe head of Nato Jens Stoltenberg said that \"we face the greatest challenges\nto our security in a generation\". But why is that? It is because the pathetic,\nsupine ruling classes of Europe have allowed our enemies to flourish in our\nmidst. They are destroying our civilisation from within. Through their\nfixation with free movement they have promoted the import of Islamic extremism\nand terrorism on an epic scale, while their ruthlessly imposed doctrine of\ncultural diversity has meant continual appeasement of Muslim militancy. Trump\nwants to challenge the jihadists: figures such as Mogherini, a Communist in\nher youth, just want to surrender to them. \"Islam is a victim\" and \"belongs in\nEurope\", she proclaims. The EU brought chaos upon Europe, not Donald Trump EU\npolicy, not Trump, has brought squalor, social breakdown, organised misogyny\nand financial chaos to Europe. The filthy migrant squatter camps in France and\nthe predatory sex attacks in Germany are the twin symbols of the nightmare\nthat Brussels has inflicted on the continent. By condemning patriotism,\nundermining solidarity and slashing military spending, Europe's politicians\nhave left the member states defenceless. And can the same rulers hector Trump\nabout American isolationism when they refused to take any serious\nresponsibility for the strength of their countries' own armed forces? Trump\nhas a mandate from the American people. Unelected and unaccountable, EU\nPresident Jean-Claude Juncker and his crew have no such democratic legitimacy.\nJuncker sneered last week that \"we need to teach the President-elect what\nEurope is and how it works\". But it doesn't work. The entire EU project has\nbeen a catastrophic failure.\n\n",

            "input": "Here's one thing we can all say for certain regarding the latest twist of the\nHillary Clinton email scandal: James Comey, who was once regarded as the Eliot\nNess of law enforcement, a modern day straight-shooter impenetrable to\npolitical pressure, will instead leave the office of FBI chief as something\ncloser to Inspector Clouseau. Don't take my word for it; that's the assessment\nof just about every law enforcement official, both former and present, I spoke\nto in the hours following his bizarre decision on Friday to reopen the case on\nthe legality of Hillary Clinton's email server, just days before the Nov 8\npresidential election. It was bizarre, these people tell me, because the whole\nsordid Hillary Clinton email saga should never have gotten this far; Comey\nlaunched an investigation that developed far more evidence than anyone in law\nenforcement ever believed existed that Hillary Clinton broke the laws\ninvolving the receipt of sensitive government documents over an easily hacked\nprivate email server while she was President Obama's secretary of state. My\nsources in law enforcement were pretty convinced Comey would do the right\nthing and recommend charges to the Obama Justice Department, despite its\npolitical consequence, because the evidence was there and Comey was supposed\nto be so non political. He was a Republican appointed by Democrat Barack Obama\nto run a quasi independent investigative arm of the DOJ because he had a\nfierce independent streak. He famously brought white-collar cases during the\npro-business Bush Administration as the US Attorney for the Southern District.\nLater in a senior position in the Bush DOJ, he refused to approve aspects of\nthe government's domestic surveillance program. But there appears to be limits\nto Comey's independence, these same people now concede. In July, Comey came up\nwith an odd excuse for not recommending criminal charges against Clinton: He\ncouldn't develop enough evidence that Clinton intended to break the law under\nthe standard of \"gross negligence.\" It was such an odd set rationale that\nComey laid out for not bringing that case that most people listening to him at\nfirst thought he was laying out his reasoning to bring charges, as he\nexplained one reckless move after another from Clinton in establishing the\nprivate server and private emails for handing all her government business.\nIndeed he initially laid out such a convincingly damning case against Clinton\nthat markets began to crash for much of Comey's tortured remarks as investors\ninitially came to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton would be indicted and\nsomeone as crazy as Donald Trump could become president. That didn't happen,\nof course, as Comey would explain -- and the markets that day recovered as he\nannounced how Hillary Clinton may have done something criminal even if she\nnever intended to do it and as a result he was giving her pass. Note to\nreader: Markets will take criminal over crazy any day of the week. But that\nwasn't the sentiment inside the FBI, where according to my law enforcement\nsources, a near mutiny broke out among career agents who believe there was\nplenty of evidence pointing to Clinton's gross negligence that Comey initially\nsaid never existed, and that their boss caved to political pressure from the\nObama DOJ. Recall, Attorney General Loretta Lynch just had a private meeting\nwith former president and possible first husband Bill Clinton just days before\nComey handed in his verdict, which added to the fetid smell of the FBI chief's\ndecision. Then there was the evidence: Remember, Clinton has never given much\nof a rationale for using only a private email account via her own server to\nsend and receive state department related emails other than its convenience,\nwhich should never outweigh national security. Meanwhile, career agents argued\nher intent was inherent in simple creation of the private email server and\nexclusive use of a private email is supposed to be verboten under various laws\nincluding the Espionage Act. Her supporters point out that others like Bush\nAdministration Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private email account,\nbut that omits the fact that Powell's email was from a computer he kept at the\nstate department and he used it before the document laws were beefed up post\n9-11. He also didn't go through the process of creating his own easily hacked\nprivate server. Another difference: Clinton used her private account\nexclusively, and Powell didn't. That's probably because Powell didn't have a\nreason to have a private server that he could control and erase its contents;\nHe didn't have a private charity that would do business with the federal\ngovernment and would become a private enrichment vehicle, as Hillary and her\nformer-president husband Bill have in the form of the Clinton Foundation. Now\nwe have Comey possibly looking to make amends with his troops, possibly\nlooking to cover his rear end, definitely looking incompetent, because of all\npeople Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former Congressman, and soon-to-be ex\nhusband of Hillary Clinton confident, Huma Abedin. FBI agents, investigating\nWeiner's alleged depravity with an underage girl, stumbled across some more\nHillary-related emails from Abedin, and as we learned Friday an investigation\nthat was \"closed\" is now suddenly open. I say closed in quotes to underscore\nthe murkiness of FBI investigative procedures. Cases are rarely officially\nclosed and even when they are the bureau will leave the door open that\nadditional information would re-ignite their efforts. If you think this story\ncould get any more surreal consider the following: law enforcement sources\ntell Fox Business that Weiner could soon cooperate with the Feds, and that\ncan't be good news for his wife or her boss. (an attorney for Anthony Weiner\ntells Fox News there is no cooperation agreement in place) Weiner, I am told,\nwas miffed at the Clinton's for keeping him away from the campaign before his\nlatest sexting episode. Now facing a possible prison term for alleged dealings\nwith an underage girl he has even more incentive to cooperate against his\nsoon-to-be ex-wife and the Clintons. I can't tell you whether the new emails\nwill reach Comey's standard for gross negligence, but that's really besides\nthe point. The country could have been spared this spectacle if he had just\ndone the right thing in July and recommended a charge against Clinton. Then\nthe Democrats could have regrouped and given the nomination to Bernie Sanders\nor Joe Biden or someone who doesn't stand a chance of being indicted or\nimpeached if elected. Yes if Hillary Clinton manages to win, she will be a\nsitting duck for every GOP investigative committee, particularly as the odds\ngrow the Republicans will now keep the House and possibly the Senate. If you\nthought the last eight years were contentious, you ain't seen nothing yet.\nThank you, James Comey.\n\n",

Or,\nas he put it, he is \"saving the American people from the nightmare of\nObamacare.\" Just a few hours later, the Trump administration announced it's\nending federal subsidies for health insurance companies that help millions of\nlow-income people pay deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. These subsidies\nwere projected to cost about [$9 billion this\nyear,](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/12/trump-obamacare-\nsubsidy-243736) according to the New York Times, and nearly $100 billion in\nthe coming decade. The new decision will go into effect immediately, the\nHealth and Human Services Department announced on Thursday. According to the\nTimes, without the subsidies, \"insurance markets could quickly unravel.\"\nInsurers have already threatened to pull out of the insurance exchanges\ncreated under Obamacare if subsidies are cut off, because they said they will\nneed much higher premiums. \"The government cannot lawfully make the cost-\nsharing reduction payments,\" the White House said in a statement. \"Congress\nneeds to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real\nrelief to the American people.\" In a joint statement, Senate and House\nMinority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi said Trump has \"apparently\ndecided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health\ncare system.\" They consider Trump's decision \"a spiteful act of vast,\npointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every\ncorner of America.\"\n\n",

She's trying to twist the presidential\nrace into a referendum on political correctness. Too embarrassed to run on her\nparty's economic record or her failed stint as secretary of state, she's\npositioning herself as top cop of the speech police. For example, Hillary is\nrunning an ad depicting pre-teen girls looking self-consciously in the mirror,\nagonizing over their bodies. Sometimes such young girls' worries turn into\ndeadly eating disorders, ultimately killing 10 percent of those affected.\nClinton cynically exploits the pain and fear felt by thousands of families.\nHer ad uses a voiceover of Trump saying things like \"she ate like a pig\" and\n\"does she have a fat ass?\" Parents struggling with their child's eating\ndisorder run to one doctor after another frantically seeking answers. The\ncauses are complex and still not entirely known -- but no one believes the\ncause is Donald Trump. Some experts blame Hollywood's glorification of skinny\nwomen for at least contributing to the rash of eating disorders and young\ngirls' body-image struggles. Instead of trying to muzzle Trump and other men,\nwhy isn't Hillary calling out her big supporters in the entertainment\nindustry? The same question applies to Hillary's double standard in bashing\nTrump for lewdness but celebrating it in popular music. Clinton's latest super\nPAC ads condemn Trump's bawdy 2005 remarks on a bus with show-biz journalist\nBilly Bush. Trump bragged to his buddy, \"I moved on her like a bitch.\" Clinton\nclaims to have been outraged when she heard it, calling it \"horrific.\"\nManhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald chuckles at Clinton's\nhypocritical \"sudden onset of Victorian vapors.\" After all, Clinton has no\nproblem with the salacious lyrics of her pal and supporter Beyonce. Even when\nBeyonce sings: \"I came to slay bitch . . . when he f-k me good I take his ass\nto Red Lobster.\" Clinton says, \"I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is\na performer.\" Trump can't catch a break with Clinton, even when he's trying to\ndo the right thing. Another Clinton ad attacks Trump reaching out to inner-\ncity African-Americans with promises of more jobs and school choice. Reminding\nminority voters that Democratic politicians have failed to improve their\neconomic opportunities, Trump asks for their vote, saying: \"What the hell do\nyou have to lose?\" Clinton's ad says: \"Everything.\" It follows her ad\nfeaturing Ku Klux Klan members praising Trump. It's McCarthyite guilt by\nassociation. Trump has no connection to the group. What's Trump actually\nguilty of? Poaching on Hillary's turf. Worse than tarring Trump, she's\nlabeling cops, teachers and millions of other Americans racists. Whenever she\ntalks to black audiences, she stokes racial resentment. She told the NAACP\nthat whites \"need to recognize our privilege and practice humility.\" All\nwhites, she claims, have \"implicit bias,\" and she wants bias training for\npolice and other professions. Implicit bias -- you're told you have it even if\nyou don't realize it, no matter how colorblind you try to be, and denying your\nbias just proves it. Implicit bias is PC drivel. There's no solid data to\nsupport it, cautions social scientists Philip Tetlock of UPenn and Gregory\nMitchell of the University of Virginia and experts from New York University\nand the University of Connecticut. But if Clinton becomes president, we'll all\nbe undergoing re-education at school or work to cure our \"implicit bias.\" To\nsee what President Hillary's America would be like, look at most college\ncampuses today. Few on campus dare to question Black Lives Matter, militant\nmulticulturalism and \"safe spaces\" to spare students from challenging ideas.\nHillary's dictating how Americans talk about race, sex, even body shapes.\nTrump calls it like he sees it. He doesn't stick to the well-rehearsed\nrhetoric of a career politician. But his supporters are sick and tired of\npolitical correctness. He's not running for saint. He's running to get the job\ndone, something Hillary Clinton has already proven she can't do. Betsy\nMcCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.\n\n",

A secret server is behind law enforcement's\ndecision to ban a former IT aide to Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nfrom the House network. Now-indicted former congressional IT aide Imran Awan\nallegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server. Police\ngrew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year, but they\nwere provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive\nviolations. The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from\nthe House network Feb. 2, according to a senior House official with direct\nknowledge of the investigation. The secret server was connected to the House\nDemocratic Caucus, an organization chaired by then-Rep. Xavier Becerra. Police\ninformed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and\nrequested a copy of it. Authorities considered the false image they received\nto be interference in a criminal investigation, the senior official said. Data\nwas also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities, the official said.\nCongressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox, so an unofficial\naccount was used, meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even\nthough he was banned from the congressional network. Awan had access to all\nemails and office computer files of 45 members of Congress who are listed\nbelow. Fear among members that Awan could release embarrassing information if\nthey cooperated with prosecutors could explain why the Democrats have refused\nto acknowledge the cybersecurity breach publicly or criticize the suspects.\nAccording to the DCNF's source, the Awans' use of Dropbox went well beyond\ncasual use. They were \"funneling of huge quantities of data offsite where it\ncould not be taken back by House authorities.\"\n\n",

The ongoing\nsaga of Harvey Weinstein's downfall continues with news about the former mogul\npossibly being stripped of his Oscar. As police in New York and London\ninvestigate the many complaints against him of sexual assault, rumours persist\nthat Weinstein will be booted from the Producers Guild of America. Meanwhile,\nthe name of The Weinstein Company will be changed and Weinstein's name will be\ntaken off future projects. Even the man's political contributions are being\nreturned or handed over to women's charities. Other industry bigwigs and\npolitical leaders are being pilloried for not condemning Weinstein fast\nenough. His wife has left, his adult daughter feared he was suicidal, and\npeople are lining up to savage the guy. Soon, he'll be drawn and quartered in\na public place, no doubt. On the business side, it's been reported that The\nWeinstein Company is a shambles, with agents and talent trying to get\nthemselves and their projects away from the bad smell, and upcoming films such\nas The Current War and The Upside in release limbo. The Financial Times says\nthat Goldman Sachs is \"exploring options\" for its small stake in The Weinstein\nCompany -- and really, people, if the Goldman Sachs is taking the moral high\nground, consider yourself toast. So why -- just out of interest -- is a\n30-year problem coming to light now? Did we reach a tipping point? Was Mr.\nWeinstein's career in decline? Is there a power struggle nobody knows about in\nthe offices of the company? Have we reached some sort of landmark in the\nongoing saga of sexual impropriety and the war between men and women?\nDoubtful. Still, it's interesting that several formerly untouchable guys have\nbeen taken down recently, including Bill Cosby, Bill O'Reilly, Roger Ailes and\nDonald Trump, that last dude being just a bit tougher to get rid of than the\nothers. Why is the Weinstein case different? It's not as if Harvey Weinstein\nvaries much from all the other handsy creeps in his business -- oohhh, the\nnames we'd insert here -- and casting couch stories have plagued the industry\nsince Florence Lawrence first fluttered her eyelashes circa 1906. Some of the\nmore interesting fallout from the Weinstein case involves the support weasels\n-- every Weinstein staffer who knew things were rotten is under a cloud, and\nso is every agent, manager, casting agent, publicist or assistant who\nknowingly sent some poor girl to talk to Weinstein in a hotel room. And how\nabout the lawyers who handled the hush money all those years? Be interesting\nto see who gets tackled next. Since Weinstein is no doubt just a difference in\ndegree, not in kind, it's tough to say if this uproar will change anything on\na permanent basis in his industry. Still, it would be interesting to know why\nHollywood is such a sleazy place. The movie industry really is a cesspool of\nsexual harassment and bullying; hard to know how so many people go to work\nevery day in such an atmosphere of fear and loathing. Many an analyst has\ndecreed that vast amounts of money and power will do it every time, and maybe\nthat's true -- look at Dominique Strauss-Kahn, or Silvio Berlusconi, or even\nl'il old home-grown Jian Ghomeshi. People will risk a lot to get anywhere near\nrich and famous, and an industry that allows ordinary people -- capable of\nmemorizing dialogue and playing make-believe -- to be treated like gods is an\nindustry in which every sort of predatory behaviour will no doubt thrive.

But could the\nshow be, at least in part, responsible for one of the scariest political\nmovements of the present moment? Lindsey Weedston thinks so. Weedston, a\n29-year-old writer from Bothell, Washington, penned an article for The\nEstablishment recently which argued that the show helped lead to the rise of\nthe alt-right. The piece, \"\n](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_limit,w_680/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/bs0629rftdi0awfb8tj2/south-\npark-cast)[How 'South Park' Helped Empower the Alt-\nRight](https://theestablishment.co/how-south-park-helped-empower-the-alt-\nright-a65abcc88c9b),\" grabbed my attention enough that I decided to call her\nup and see why exactly she thought Kyle, Cartman, and crew led us to Richard\nSpencer, 4Chan, and Charlottesville. Our conversation, edited lightly for\nlength and clarity, is below. To start off, how does South Park treat what\nsome people might think of as \"PC culture\"? I read [a\npost](https://imgur.com/908Ue1X) that explained this really well--South Park's\nhighest moral goal is to not care. It treats PC culture as [if] the opposite\nof PC culture is not to care about anything. So caring about an issue is\nbasically stupid, and pretty much every episode goes back to: it doesn't\nmatter, being PC is uncool, and not giving a fuck about anything is the way\nyou should feel. In your article you trace a history of that attitude,\nstarting with the misinterpretation of a character in an Oliver Stone movie.\nCan you take me through that? That was interesting. So [the 1987 movie] Wall\nStreet, I didn't know before I researched for the article that Oliver Stone\nactually meant it the opposite of how so many people took it. Wall Street was\nsupposed to be an indictment of Wall Street and the type of person that thinks\ngreed is good. It was very interesting to find that so many people actually\nwent with the mantra \"greed is good,\" and it seems like that has shaped a lot\nof our culture. Now we have [prosperity\nChristianity](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/topics/p/prosperity-\ngospel/)--actually telling people that God wants them to collect as much\nwealth as possible. It's not just Wall Street. For a long time, our capitalist\nsociety has led up to this idea that the ultimate goal is to collect as much\nwealth as possible. That movie accelerated the idea of collecting all the\nwealth and power you can. And then you talk about shock jock's of the '80s and\n'90s, the Howard Sterns of the world. What does that have to do with the South\nPark-popularized attitude of caring being uncool? The original title of this\narticle I pitched was actually \"The History of Celebrated Assholes.\" My first\ndraft of the piece, I ended up researching early forms of shock and asshole\ncomedy. I found out the person considered the first shock jock was actually a\nblack man, [Petey\nGreene](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/adjustyourcolor/film.html). Howard\nStern was influenced by him. It's really interesting to learn the kind of\nthings he talked about. He was appealing because he was very down to Earth,\nand he spoke to the black community in a very straightforward way that no\nwhite disk jockey had ever before. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was\nassassinated, he went on air and started speaking to the community, and [is\ncredited with calming the situation\ndown](https://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2014/05/15/petey-greene-talks-\ndown-riots-1968). You can go on YouTube and find some of the shows and listen\nto the way he speaks. It's very colloquial. He just acts like a normal person.\nI think white people at the time looked at that as being shocking, and that's\nwhy he was labeled as a shock jock. He was really active in the community. He\npromoted education and feeding the hungry. He wasn't an asshole, but history\nis very interesting. In my original draft, I wrote about how he influenced\nHoward Stern. Howard Stern was actually invited onto his show. [Stern went on\nin black face and used the n\nword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCFN3RrfaUk), and Greene thought it was\nfunny. Greene died fairly young, so then you move onto Howard Stern's career.\nHoward Stern, I'm sure, has done some good stuff in his life. But he is very\nmuch associated with the shock jock label, and a lot of what he does is just\nto rile people up. I think it's interesting how you have that transition from\nsomebody who was just being real and communicating to his people in a way that\nmade sense to him; and then you have Howard Stern, who makes a lot of money--\nand in fact an entire career--from pissing people off. How do you get to the\nalt-right from that? How does South Park's overall attitude connect to the\nalt-right? I believe that South Park's anti-PC messages paved the way for\nwhite supremacist groups to recruit much of the largely white male fanbase\ninto what is now referred to as the alt-right, or other groups that are\nidentical in all but name. Matt and Trey promoted this idea that you should be\nable to say or animate anything you want in the name of satire and humor, and\nany harm that it caused either didn't exist or didn't matter. When they\nexperienced backlash for their intensifying mockery of already-vulnerable\ngroups and their attitude of, \"Repeating horrible things said by bigots up to\nand including Nazis is funny because it upsets people,\" they reacted by\ndepicting their critics as free-speech-oppressing caricatures like the \" [PC\nbro](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pc-bro).\" They promoted the idea that\nmarginalized people--trans people, people of color, Jewish people, etc.--\nspeaking out against harm caused by South Park's brand of \"humor\" and [the\nshow's] \"I do what I want\" attitude are the real oppressors. White supremacist\ngroups and their better-at-PR counterpart the \"alt-right\" use this message\nconstantly to recruit young white men and boys. They tell these kids that\nthey're the ones being oppressed by those telling them that they have\nprivilege, and therefore need to make some effort to at least not use certain\nwords and maybe examine prejudiced attitudes they might have picked up from a\nculture that is prejudiced in many ways. The alt-right promotes the idea of\nwhite male victimization, drawing in youth that has been told by South Park\nthat the plight of marginalized groups doesn't matter and that \"political\ncorrectness\" is oppressing them. Once those groups have their loyalty, they\ncan then indoctrinate these young guys into straight up white supremacist\nideas under the guise that \"the PC police don't want you to think about this.\"\nI don't think Matt and Trey meant to create an army for the alt-right, but\nthey seem to be leaning into it rather than admitting that they might have\nmessed up. Cartman plays a big part in your article. He's often not the hero\nin the storylines of the individual episodes, but he is a fan favorite. Can\nyou break down why that's a problem? Cartman is a perfect representation of\nsatire gone wrong. Just like with Wall Street, the people who view your\ncontent take the literal meaning of something instead of taking it as the\nindictment that it is. It's pretty clear, especially in the earlier episodes,\nthat you're not supposed to like Cartman. You aren't supposed to identify with\nhim. You're supposed to hate him, or at least understand he is the opposite of\nthe ideal of a human being. That is supposed to be represented in his bigotry,\nhis ignorance, and his appearance as well, with him being fat. And yet he is a\nfan favorite, and people do identify with him. I think it was Matt Stone who\nsaid he identifies with Cartman more than any of the other characters. I think\ntheir original intention was to say, okay, don't be like Cartman. But instead,\nyou have the opposite reaction of people idealizing his attitude and his\nselfishness and his desire to make people suffer and his bigotry. He has\nbecome a representation of how the fans feel that you should be. Can you talk\nabout \" [South Park\nRepublicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park_Republican)\"--South Park\n[being adopted\nby](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9781621571124)\n[right\nwingers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9781621571124)?\nThat plays into what I think is the logical conclusion of the anti-PC\nmovement. Like I said in the article, there has been a rebellion against this\nidea of being PC. Political correctness has evolved into a derogatory term\nmeaning, you are being sensitive to someone. It has become this big boogeyman.\nThere is an idea that there is this social justice warrior, PC police entity\nwho will come and yell at you and punish you if you say what you are actually\nthinking. So there has been a rebellion against this strawman. It has come\ndown to, if you care about anyone at all, if you want to be sensitive to\nanyone's needs, then you're this politically correct nerd or you're a nun with\na ruler or an authority figure telling people what to do. You are therefore\nuncool and the enemy. It's very reactionary. But it's so popular and so\nwidespread on the right now, and you actually have people coming out with\narticles and people in the White House using that rhetoric to help further\ntheir political careers. So it's really not surprising to me that there\narticles out there saying South Park is right on actual political issues. What\nhas followed South Park's wake? The first example that comes to mind is a lot\nof the cultural treatment of trans people. South Park has had some really\ntransphobic content. Even before [the Caitlyn Jenner\nepisode](http://auburnpub.com/blogs/citizen_pop/why-south-park-s-depiction-of-\ncaitlyn-jenner-was-one/article_a93cbdfe-6543-11e5-97f2-1b8a8f4d44ec.html),\nthere was the whole treatment of Mr. Garrison and his sex change. I remember\nthe episode where they included footage of an actual gender affirmation\nsurgery, just saying, \"look how gross this is.\" They had a caption like, \"This\nis footage of the actual surgery,\" as though it's supposed to be horrible and\nsad because it's gross. But any surgery looks gross and disgusting. Their\ndefinite goal was to be like, this is gross and this is wrong. You see a huge\namount of transphobia from a lot of alt-right groups. You have these bathroom\nbills that are trying to keep trans people out of public restrooms, which is\nbasically keeping them out of public life. It's trying to keep them from\nhaving access to any kind of normal life. The sudden emergence of the bathroom\nbills surprised me, but maybe it shouldn't have. It seemed to come out of\nnowhere, but then you look at the timing and it does kind of follow Caitlyn\nJenner's coming out to the public as a woman. That in itself probably would\nhave gotten some backlash, but then you look at how popular South Park is, and\nthere's no way it didn't play a role in people reacting the way they did:\nreacting like, oh that's just so gross--their existence is gross and wrong.\nYou end your essay with a call for what you call radical kindness. What does\nthat mean? Radical kindness comes from being around young people, specifically\nin communities that are more social justice-oriented. In my community, I'm\nseeing a shift towards memes being positive and used to uplift people. I think\npeople are just tired of beating on each other and attacking each other, and\nthe younger generations especially are starting to rebel against that. I feel\nlike a lot of what my generation, millennials, has put out there has been\nnegative. We're kind of a depressed generation, so I think younger people are\nreacting to that and deciding, let's be nice to each other. In a society where\nbeing mean to each other is the norm, kindness is punk. That's rebelling.\nThat's what's cool.\n\n",

Instead, they are partnering with the flailing Republicans and\ntheir president in failure. Democrats are leaning indulgently on the politics\nof race and gratuitous opposition to Trump, and they appear content to be the\nparty of sanctuary cities, safe spaces and single-payer health care. Weeks ago\nthey released an \"agenda\" designed to offer voters \"A Better Deal,\" but who\nwould know what's in it since all they talk about is Trump? Meanwhile, if\nTrump's trajectory doesn't improve, the party may face the weakest, most\nunpopular president in modern times in 2020 -- but with who? Sens. Bernie\nSanders and Elizabeth Warren are running, or think they are. Why are they\nbeing encouraged? Sounding like a garden-variety conservative, liberal New\nYork Times columnist Charles Blow asked last week on Twitter: \"Serious\nquestion: What is the Dem party now in addition to anti-Trump? What does it\nstand for now? Also, who's leading? #GhostParty.\" The last two weeks have been\nTrump's worst in office, yet it seems the lower he sinks, Democratic leaders\ndo likewise. The president's pathetic and irresponsible response to a white\nsupremacist demonstration in Charlottesville -- where a protester was mowed\ndown by a driver and killed -- has prompted not only fellow Republicans to\ncriticize Trump but now his own National Economic Council director, [Gary\nCohn](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/us/politics/gary-cohn-trump-\ncharlottesville.html?mcubz=0&_r=0), as well. Still, Democrats went overboard.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling on Congress to censure the\npresident for the \"repulsiveness of his words and actions,\" adding that \"every\nday, the president gives us further evidence of why such a censure is\nnecessary.\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence\nCommittee, which is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and\nany potential ties the president and his campaign had to those activities,\nresponded Friday, saying in a [Twitter\npost](https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/901108564495933440?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\nthat he will co-sponsor a censure resolution because Trump \"expresses views\ninimical to our values.\" Rep. Jackie Speier, another member of the committee,\nhas called for Trump's removal under the 25th Amendment. Speier tweeted that\n\"POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place\nthe country in grave danger.\" Rep. Keith Ellison, deputy chairman of the\nDemocratic National Committee, said on CNN Monday that POTUS has \"sympathy\"\nfor white supremacists. He's not just a congressman anymore but a party\nofficial -- no wonder the DNC's fundraising is at a record low. Rep. Maxine\nWaters, whose late-in-life internet fame recently landed her on \"The View,\"\ntweeted the day after Charlottesville that \"Trump has made it clear - w/Bannon\n&amp; Gorka in the WH, &amp; the Klan in the streets, it is now the White\nSupremacists House. #Charlottesville.\" Should Democrats win back the House\nnext year, Waters would be chairman of the Financial Services Committee, an\ninfluential voice at the leadership table. Former Vermont Gov. and DNC\nChairman Howard \"The Scream\" Dean said last week, \"If you want to vote for a\nracist in the White House, then you better vote for Republicans.\" The party\nelder recently declared he would stop contributing to the Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee because it will consider recruiting pro-life\ncandidates. After all these years, eight of them during President Obama's two\nterms, Pelosi is now calling on the House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove\nConfederate statues -- which \"have always been reprehensible\" \\-- immediately\nfrom the halls of Congress \"if Republicans are serious about rejecting white\nsupremacy.\" Polling after the events in Charlottesville show that while a\nmajority of Americans disapprove of Trump's response, 62 percent said\nmonuments to Confederate leaders should remain. Yet these monuments are\nsuddenly a pressing federal issue to national Democrats. Former Homeland\nSecurity Secretary Jeh Johnson, who enjoys great respect across aisle, has\ngone a step further than his party's left, saying the statue removal is \"not a\nmatter of political correctness,\" but \"of public safety and homeland\nsecurity.\" This from the man who never made the issue a priority as head of\nDHS. While countering Trump is essential -- after all, Republicans are doing\nthe same -- the focus should remain on even more fundamental matters: guarding\nthe Constitution and the separation of powers; stressing facts over\nfalsehoods; preventing a government shutdown that Trump's lobbying for;\ndefending the right to a free press to hold him accountable; urging him to pay\ncost-sharing reduction payments under the Affordable Care Act to provide more\ncertainty to the fragile exchanges; and pushing for any bipartisan cooperation\npossible on health care, tax reform and infrastructure projects. Democrats\nmust leave the fight to stop him and his family from running a kleptocracy, an\nissue the GOP remains silent on, to outsiders who have filed lawsuits. Leave\nthe statue debate to the states. Leave the questions of his stability to\nRepublicans like Sen. Bob Corker. Leave the Russia investigation to special\ncounsel Robert Mueller. Let the media report on West Wing dysfunction or how\nmuch Trump television watches. Democrats should leave all that alone.\nDemocrats must also decide whether they want President Obama back in the\nspotlight. Rudderless and leaderless, some party operators long for him swoop\nin and right the ship, yet they still blame him for sinking it with epic\nelection losses from 2009 to 2016. As they attempt to plot a path forward and\nregain seats in state legislatures, governorships, the U.S. House and Senate\n-- and someday the White House -- Democrats need new faces and leaders and\ncan't lean too heavily on the 44th president. Yet some are calling for him to\nbe a loud voice: \"None of the potential Democratic presidential candidates\nhave the visibility or credibility to be effective,\" party strategist Brad\nBannon told The Hill. Finally, as Democrats like Reps. Brad Sherman, Al Green\nand Gwen Moore continue to push for impeachment, party leaders must avoid what\nObama's onetime senior adviser David Axelrod warned would likely be a costly\nmistake. \"Remember: A third of the country supports this president,\" he said\non CNN. \"That's a very dangerous road to go down. And if you ever did go down\nthat road, you're opening a Pandora's box that will never end.\" What's already\nin that box is widespread voter disgust. People are turning away from both\nparties and the pool of gettable voters is shrinking, which means base\npolitics will be less and less effective in the years to come. Democrats must\nconvince voters they take governing more seriously than partisan politics and\nwill focus on economic growth instead of statues, tweets and Russia. Or they\ncan stay in the minority a lot longer. A.B. Stoddard is associate editor of\nRealClearPolitics and a columnist. She is also host of \"No Labels Radio\" on\nSirius XM's POTUS Channel.

            "input": "The military taught me at an early age that one must know their enemy. This\nadage does not simply pertain to combat either. In all facets of your life,\nyou must always endeavor to see things from the perspective of others. Not\nonly does this allow you to empathize with them, but it also shows you the way\nto gain the tactical advantage. The greatest pundit of this would have to be\nSun Tzu, an ancient Chinese warlord who wrote the book The Art of War. This\nbook is one of the best books on strategy ever written. This strategy goes far\nbeyond the confines of combat, however. He spends a great deal of time\ndiscussing how war is mostly a mental game, explaining that force is simply\none facet within an expansive set of options. One of my favorite quotes is,\n\"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a\nhundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory\ngained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor\nyourself, you will succumb in every battle.\" I do this very well. In fact, I\ndo it too well. Just ask my wife. I know how I argue and I know how she\nargues, and I use this knowledge to my advantage every time. It is not\nintentional at this point, just something that has been ingrained into me. So\nat the end of the day, I can respect an adversary who is capable of truly\nmanipulating a situation to gain the psychological advantage. It is for this\nreason that I must tip my hat to the Democratic party as a whole. I try very\nhard to be honest regardless of which side of the political aisle you may be\non. When someone does something wrong, I will call them out for it. Typically,\nthis is very easy to do with the Democrats, as virtually everything about\ntheir platform goes against what I believe the Constitution stands for. With\nthat being said, I must also recognize when my enemy is gaining the advantage\nthrough manipulation; while I may not agree with their methods, I have to\nrespect and be impressed with their results. Consider this--the Democrats have\nfor the past eight years seen a huge loss in political power. According to Fox\nNews, the total loss of Democrat-held elected positions as of December 2016\nwas 1,042. In fact, during the Obama reign, they went from 55 to 46 Senate\nseats and from 256 to 194 House seats at the federal level. Things didn't\nimprove at the state level, with the number of Democratic governors going from\n28 to 16 and a total loss of 958 legislative seats. No compatible source was\nfound for this video. There is only one way to look at these numbers--a\ncomplete and total repudiation of liberal policies and beliefs. What made this\neven funnier at the time was how the Democrats then doubled down on their\ndivisiveness. A great example is when Sally Brown, DNC Chair hopeful, stated\nthat, \"My job is to listen and be a voice and shut other white people down\nwhen they want to interrupt…We have to teach [others] how to communicate, how\nto be sensitive and how to shut their mouths if they are white.\" Or even when\nHoward Dean said that hate speech wasn't protected speech. My favorite,\nthough, was when Tom Perez, Democratic National Committee chair, said that if\nyou wanted to be a Democrat, you had to be pro-choice. However, what was\noriginally funny to me quickly curdled into shock. The problem is that the\nDemocrats have something going for them that those on the other side simply\ndon't seem to be able to do. They know their enemy. They know how to\nmanipulate the Republicans in office to give the left everything they want. I\nwould never have believed that this was possible. The Republicans own both\nhouses of Congress and had the overwhelming support of the American people.\nThey were elected into office to enact the items that they ran on: defunding\nplanned parenthood, repealing Obamacare, enacting tax reform, and building a\nwall. What did they accomplish out of that? Nothing! To make it even worse,\nthey showed their incompetence by releasing Obamacare version 2.0. How is it\npossible for a party to have the majority control at both the state and\nnational levels and yet not be able to enact the very legislation that it ran\non? The answer to that is the Democratic party. Not only were they able to\nkeep the Republicans from moving on their platform, they now get to pass the\nbuck on the failure of Obamacare to the Republicans. Now, in a continuing show\nof their exceptional ability to control the government even when not in power,\nthey have managed to have special council appointed to look into the Russian\ninvolvement in the election cycle. This ensures that even though there has\nbeen no evidence to suggest that the Trump administration did anything\nillegal, the question remains front and center over his presidency. They were\neven able to avoid the same scrutiny within their own party, where there were\na plethora of potentially illegal actions that were swept under the rug. I\nhate to say it, but my hat is off to you, Democratic party. You have managed\nto ensure the catastrophic collapse of the party who won control of the\ncountry due to your failed policies. So how is it possible that they were able\nto do this? The answer is simply that they actually believe in their cause.\nThis has both helped and hurt them. Wanting an America with less freedom and\nconstricted liberties does not sell well. At the end of the day, there is only\nso much crazy talk the populace can endure without finally shutting you down.\nHowever, when you truly believe in your cause, the elected posts are secondary\nto what your message is. This is not true for the Republicans, who clearly\ncovet power over the interest of the country. They are so worried about\nkeeping their control that they would turn on their own principals to protect\nthemselves. Knowing this allows the left to continue to move their position\nand policies forward, even when not in power, and the right is doing the same\nthing that they always do. They are sitting by and watching out of fear that\nthey will be blamed. The typical Republican politician is clearly not capable\nof real leadership. Real leadership inspires those around them and rallies\nthem under a single banner. The sad thing is that in this case, this was the\nbanner that the American people elected their officials to turn into reality.\nIf the Republicans do not figure this out quickly, they are setting themselves\nup for more than just a loss. They are looking at a complete shakeup of their\nparty. Maybe that is what is needed, though. Maybe this is actually for the\nbest. I remember right before retiring telling my son that there comes a point\nin every career when you are no longer able to bend and adapt. You have grown\ntoo complacent in your ways and view new ideas and thoughts as a threat to\nyour existence. It is at this point that you have become the dinosaur. I am\npretty sure that at this point, what the party needs is an extinction-level\nevent, and the Democrats are more than willing to lead us to that well.\n\n",

            "input": "Governor Cuomo of New York is threatening to sue the federal Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement agency to stop its ongoing raids to detain illegal\nimmigrants wanted for serious crimes like assault and rape. A staggering 80%\nof those apprehended in recent ICE raids in New York were either convicted\ncriminals or charged with crimes. But Mr. Cuomo is siding with criminals over\ntheir victims.  He's playing politics. Faced with a challenge on his left\nflank from Cynthia Nixon, he's desperate to prove his liberal bona fides.\nPublic safety be damned. The governor is parroting Democrats across the nation\nwho claim ICE should be abolished because it's breaking apart families and\npeaceful communities. The facts prove otherwise. Eighty-eight percent of the\nillegal immigrants arrested in recent Los Angeles ICE raids and 81% arrested\nthroughout California, according to the latest ICE data, had criminal\nconvictions. These are bad guys. So when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\nclaims that \"unjust and cruel\" ICE raids \"terrorize innocent immigrant\nfamilies,\" don't buy it. Mr. Cuomo is making the same bogus claim. Last\nThursday, the governor [denounced an ICE\nraid](https://nypost.com/2018/04/25/cuomo-threatens-to-sue-ice-over-\nimmigration-raids/) on an Upstate farm looking for Marcial DeLeon-Aguilar, a\nthree-time deportee convicted for felony aggravated assault. Mr. Cuomo\ncomplained that Aguilar's children had to watch their father being pinned by\nofficers to block his escape. What about families victimized by violent\nillegals? Since January 2016, at least 25 Long Island youths have been\nexecuted by the MS-13 gang of Central American illegals. Some of the victims\nwere left so mutilated they could hardly be identified. MS-13 beats the\nyoungsters with baseball bats, puts plastic bags over their heads to suffocate\nthem and then slices off their noses, ears and lips with machetes. No one\nreads these victims their constitutional rights. ICE's Operation Matador\ntargets MS-13 gang members. Yet Mr. Cuomo seems angrier at the ICE agents than\nat the MS-13 butchers. Laughably, Mr. Cuomo issued a \"cease and desist\" letter\nto ICE last week, ordering federal agents to touch base with local police\nbefore taking enforcement action. Mr. Cuomo doesn't have a leg on which to\nstand. Check the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution: Uncle Sam\ndoesn't need Andrew Cuomo's permission to enforce federal laws. Why the surge\nin visible, violent sweeps? ICE is forced to conduct sweeps out in residential\ncommunities because New York's sanctuary laws are preventing the agency from\ntaking custody of criminal aliens before they're released from jail, like the\nagency used to do. As ICE's Deputy Director Thomas Homan points out, these\nsanctuary policies are needlessly exposing New Yorkers to violence. Mr. Cuomo\nis mimicking California Democrats, who are in open rebellion against federal\nlaw enforcement. In February, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public alert\nabout a planned ICE raid in her city before it took place, tipping off\nhundreds of wanted criminals to scatter. Attorney General Sessions said to Ms.\nShaaf, \"How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to\npromote your radical open borders agenda?\" Political pandering is driving this\nagenda. An amazing 27% of California's population are immigrants. Immigrants\ndisproportionately favor big government. California hasn't elected a statewide\nRepublican since 2006. New York is moving in the same direction, with 23% of\nits population foreign-born and Democrats gaining increasing control of state\ngovernment. Mr. Cuomo and other Democrats have been resisting the federal\ncrackdown on immigrant-related crime and calling for increased spending on\nafter-school music and sports programs to provide an \"alternative\" to gang\nactivity in immigrant communities. That's nonsense. Brutes willing to torture\nand mutilate a human being with a machete will not be dissuaded by learning to\nplay the flute. President Trump calls them \"animals\" who have turned peaceful\nneighborhoods \"into bloodstained killing fields.\" He's got the right plan: \"We\nwill find you. We will arrest you. We will jail you. And we will deport you.\"\nMs. McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.\nreceive the latest by email: subscribe to the new york sun's free mailing list\n\n",

(You can watch the video\nbelow if you have the stomach for it.) But at no time did she ever discuss a\nman who she did know did horrific things. No \"by the way, Harvey Weinstein is\na dirtbag who tried to get me to watch him shower for a part.\" Why didn't that\ncome up? I find it very difficult to believe Judd is this angry at Donald\nTrump, a man who has never done anything to her, or provably to anybody, when\nthere is a man who did do something horrible to her whom she could be\nscreeching about. She needs therapy. And possibly tranquilizers. Jennifer\nLawrence was recently interviewed for her epic fail of a movie, Mother, and\ngave Democratic talking points like \"equality for women in the workplace,\"\nblamed Trump for hurricanes, and rattled off the same tired Leftist arguments\nwe've heard forever. During another interview, she claimed that she is\nterrified of Trump and wanted to make a video of herself saying \"F*** you!\" to\nhim. Lawrence claimed she felt she could be a spokesperson for women who are\nunderpaid: I felt like I had a voice, people look at me and listen to me, and\nto not say anything, that's never sat well with me. That seems disingenuous,\nbecause she kept quiet about the creepy mogul who everyone in Hollywood\nappears to have known was abusing women. Why stay quiet over that? Don't you\nhave a responsibility to alert other women that there is a serial sexual\npredator in their midst? Lawrence hasn't alleged any harassment from\nWeinstein, although she is seen looking awkward in many photos with him while\nhe holds her too close to his massive girth. It wouldn't surprise me if she\nhad first-hand knowledge of his depravity. Gwyneth Paltrow is the most\napolitical in this list. While she supported Obama, she never had anything\nmore interesting to say beyond how handsome she thinks he is. Mostly she\nspends her life divorcing people and selling outrageously priced trinkets to\nrich women online. While she doesn't fit in the category of commenting on\nTrump, she bears much responsibility in this scandal.\n\n",

            "input": "Politicians are trying to deceive you. Modern (American) politics is\nessentially a game in which politicians say and do whatever they possibly can\nto persuade people that they are an ideal leader deserving of a vote. But you\nalready know that. Hopefully. Most of us are pretty cynical about politics and\nstraight-up expect politicians to lie to us. We understand that posturing,\nover-promising, tricky rhetoric, and psychological manipulation are par for\nthe course in the political arena. Interestingly, though, I've been hearing\nsome claims regarding the current presidential race that contradict the\ntypical cynicism with which most people view political candidates.\nSpecifically, I've heard many people expressing the belief that Donald Trump\nand Bernie Sanders are refreshingly different from typical political\ncandidates. Why? Because they say what they really feel and think, supposedly.\nThey aren't just talking heads. They're real people who will let their real\nviews and ideas be known, for better or worse. That might be true, to some\nextent. Trump and Sanders might be more authentic than most politicians (which\nwouldn't take much). It's almost impossible to say. The Truth But even if they\nare, make no mistake: They are still playing the game like everyone else. I'm\nnot saying anything about their merits as candidates or people, and I'm not\nmaking any kind of moral judgment. I'm just saying that they too are\nposturing, over-promising, and employing tricky rhetoric and psychological\ntactics to win over their audiences. Don't think for a second that they're\nnot. No one would have a prayer of winning a presidential race without doing\nthose things. But people are viewing them as utterly genuine. People are\ntaking them at face value. Sanders has this effect on people because he's so\nfiercely passionate about the issues. I actually believe he sincerely cares\nabout the things he wants to change, and so he exudes an earnestness while\nspeaking that captivates many people, especially people in my generation.\nNonetheless, I assure you that Sanders is self-aware of his grandiose, fiery\nstyle and his calls for revolution. He knows he's over-promising, and he's\nconsciously trying to create a tsunami of unrealistically high hope for a\nbetter world and ride that wave into the White House, like Obama did. It's a\ngood strategy, though if he gets elected, many people will probably be upset\nwhen the revolution doesn't arrive, when the billionaire class continues to\nexist, and when big money continues to influence politics.¹ Trump, on the\nother hand, is perceived as honest because he says and does so many ludicrous\nthings, compared to traditional candidates. Trump's behavior is so ridiculous\nthat people can't fathom that most of it could be an act, a strategy, a role\nhe's learned to play. But it is. And whereas Bernie is trying to ride a wave\nof hope into the White House, Trump is trying to ride a wave of fear and\nanger. Trump's appeal is downright frightening because we are at a rather\nprecarious moment in the history of the United States and the history of the\nworld. The planet is filled with nuclear warheads; environmental crises are\noccurring/looming; the largest refugee crisis since World War II is taking\nplace. The 21st century is a time in which the countries of the world need\nmore than ever to cooperate with one another, consider a global perspective,\nand devise strategies that will make the human enterprise sustainable through\nthe 21st century and hopefully [far\nbeyond](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/global-resilience-guru). But Trump\nisn't much of a cooperator. He's explicitly stated that he wants to build a\nwall around much of the United States, and he's made comments that reveal a\nfrighteningly uncritical and violent approach to international relations (on\nISIS: \"I would bomb the shit out of 'em,\" and \" [… you have to take out their\nfamilies.](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/25/10828770/trump-terrorist-family-\nappeal)\"). From my vantage point, a leader like Trump is more likely to help\nbring about World War III than a more sustainable, equitable, and unified\nhuman enterprise.² Many people don't see it this way, though. Many believe\nthat Trump's aggressive and America-centric approach to politics will be our\nsaving grace. This may have something to do with the hypothesized\npsychological divide between people who lean Left versus people who lean\nRight. Some fascinating studies have suggested that there are [neurobiological\ndifferences between liberals and\nconservatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_political_orientation#cite_note-\nRK-5). One study found, for instance, that conservatives tend to respond to\nthreatening situations with more aggression than liberals. If one wanted to\nappeal to conservative-minded people, it follows then that one could paint a\npicture of the world as One Giant Threat to America and propose an extremely\naggressive plan to ameliorate the situation. As we'll see, Donald Trump is a\nmaster of this persuasive tactic. He's a master of a number of other tactics\nas well, and the cumulative effect of these tactics is that he's gone from\nbeing considered a joke candidate to having a decent chance of becoming the\nnext leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world. 12\nPsychological Tactics That Make Donald Trump a Master Manipulator Let's take a\ncloser look at the various tactics Trump has used to climb into his present\nposition. The following points were gathered primarily from two\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LR6EA91zLo)\n[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvVfj0ov8k8)³ created by Charlie\nHoupert, which provide an excellent analysis of Trump's various psychological\nstrategies. You'll find the videos embedded at the bottom of this article, if\nyou'd like to watch them, but that isn't necessary, as I'll thoroughly\nsummarize the 12 strategies they discuss. 1. Sowing Seeds of Fear Wiki Commons\nTrump has said, \"You're going to have more World Trade Centers. It's going to\nget worse and worse, folks,\" and \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not\nsending their best. They're bringing drugs; they're bringing crime; they're\nrapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" These are blatant instances of\nfear-mongering. Trump deliberately hones in on frightening statistical\nrarities -- terrorist attacks against the US and immigrants who are dangerous\nrapists -- and acts like they've become the norm. [Violence has actually\ndeclined](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143122010/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143122010&linkCode=as2&tag=bates0b-20&linkId=CI2NZMTYLMTWSNBB)\nover recent decades and centuries, but Trump makes it seem like the opposite\nhas happened. Why does he do this? Charlie Houpert, the creator of\n[the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LR6EA91zLo)\n[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvVfj0ov8k8) I mentioned, explains it\nwell: \"Fear is an incredibly powerful emotion. It captures our attention like\nno other emotion can. We focus intensely on the thing that is giving us that\nfear. Secondly, it shuts down higher thinking. When we're terrified by a bump\nin the night, we don't focus on the probability that it's just the wind. Our\ncritical thinking skills dip as we focus solely on protecting ourselves.\nThirdly, it feels crappy, so the fastest way to get out of fear and move\ntoward a powerful emotion is to move into anger.\" [Proven\nWinners](https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&ai=C2M4-Bk-\nFW5WeOMuxgwa9g6aoBOLkpYNToLext-0HZBABILylzCFgyQagAbj1jOcDyAEG4AIAqAMByAMCqgSWAk_QU-2Mxc35UcQpM1fpe3sX81R7RQIIlSSM8TxeLiqMawBVfRPsOgfOqY6hpaCsoU7p3RijMU-\nGCSIgV1K-gcXmVbvuPRUwd8zhaiT58-mWt2FGGvHlCpmBwjNT0_676J6_4vMq-6tVJSiAotUQTV2--\nbQEFIdmBWq7jSPHlBjK73hI99pqyYEvwB4ICXFw6uPAkCu9ELyJMiTc3H6dEss9mrvrwNJUPkgap5FApTTrynTyDg3UAKo0b7C10_Z4gZxwVcns_eLtQd74KbqJmP3bgYk0_yJXyFlknw9pEn8SLf77DL0ieLKMGxTzwjaLXw-3EUsf84Gqneu5o7BjXwxq9TJwnt_ADDwbwxmrqTNGV0AXlplU4AQBoAY3gAewivMYqAeOzhuoB9XJG6gH2csbqAfPzBuoB6a-G6gHmM4b2AcB0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tODg2MDM4NDU4ODI5ODk4ObEJ0Ut-C2nTUhGACgPYEwM&num=1&sig=AOD64_1d4-M2u9SCDiT8TccThWvC6EXmSQ&client=ca-\npub-3153065230153281&adurl=https://www.provenwinners.com/winners-circle)\n[Visit Site](https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&ai=C2M4-Bk-\nFW5WeOMuxgwa9g6aoBOLkpYNToLext-0HZBABILylzCFgyQagAbj1jOcDyAEG4AIAqAMByAMCqgSWAk_QU-2Mxc35UcQpM1fpe3sX81R7RQIIlSSM8TxeLiqMawBVfRPsOgfOqY6hpaCsoU7p3RijMU-\nGCSIgV1K-gcXmVbvuPRUwd8zhaiT58-mWt2FGGvHlCpmBwjNT0_676J6_4vMq-6tVJSiAotUQTV2--\nbQEFIdmBWq7jSPHlBjK73hI99pqyYEvwB4ICXFw6uPAkCu9ELyJMiTc3H6dEss9mrvrwNJUPkgap5FApTTrynTyDg3UAKo0b7C10_Z4gZxwVcns_eLtQd74KbqJmP3bgYk0_yJXyFlknw9pEn8SLf77DL0ieLKMGxTzwjaLXw-3EUsf84Gqneu5o7BjXwxq9TJwnt_ADDwbwxmrqTNGV0AXlplU4AQBoAY3gAewivMYqAeOzhuoB9XJG6gH2csbqAfPzBuoB6a-G6gHmM4b2AcB0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tODg2MDM4NDU4ODI5ODk4ObEJ0Ut-C2nTUhGACgPYEwM&num=1&sig=AOD64_1d4-M2u9SCDiT8TccThWvC6EXmSQ&client=ca-\npub-3153065230153281&adurl=https://www.provenwinners.com/winners-circle) Major\nnews outlets portray the world as a terrifying place because doing so captures\npeople's attention. Trump is doing the same thing. Fear ensnares our attention\nlike nothing else can, while simultaneously short-circuiting our higher\ncognitive functioning. This is unsettling because our natural response to fear\nis to escape or destroy whatever is threatening us as quickly as possible. It\nis quite natural for humans to cope with fear by becoming angry and\naggressive. Trump fuels this fire of fear-driven rage and hostility as much as\nhe possibly can and directs it toward non-American outgroups. He says things\nlike \"China is taking our jobs; they're taking our money,\" and \"Syrians are\nnow being caught at the Southern border; we don't know who they are; could be\nISIS.\" He sets up false dichotomies between the interests of Americans and the\ninterests of other humans of the world, such that if you disagree with him,\nyou appear to be anti-American. This leaves many credulous viewers with one\nobvious response: to be an angry, aggressive, Trump-supporting American who\nviews the rest of the world with suspicion and aggression! This potent\ncombination of fear-, anger-, and aggression-mongering then sets Trump up for\none of his most effective lies: that he is the only big, strong man tough\nenough to do what needs to be done to kick everyone else's ass and \"make\nAmerica great again.\" Trump makes unrealistic claims such as \"No one else will\nkeep you safe,\" and \"No one is going to mess with us.\" He presents himself as\nthe most dominant and strongest-willed candidate -- the only candidate capable\nof returning the US to its rightful position as Imminent, Dominant Global\nSuperpower. But again, do we need America to dominate other countries/entities\nat this point in history? It's likely that some amount of military action is\nadvisable, as certain groups (e.g. ISIS) are committing brutal crimes against\ninnocent people. However, if one looks at the bigger picture, it becomes clear\nthat cooperation rather than conflict must become the rule in the human\nenterprise, if the human species is to persist into the deep future. On a\nplanet now laced with nuclear warheads, unbounded aggression is no longer an\noption. And in a biosphere facing various environmental crises, our species\nmust recognize the collective goal of devising sustainable systems to avert\ncatastrophe. But, as I mentioned earlier, research has suggested that\nconservative-minded people respond more aggressively to threatening situations\nthan liberal-minded people. Instinctively aggressive people respond favorably\nto Trump's call for a return to an Ultra-Dominant America. That some people\nare more instinctively aggressive than others is not a \"bad\" thing. Clearly,\nthis arrangement was beneficial in our primal past, or we would not have\nevolved this way. However, we don't live in the world of our distant ancestors\nanymore. We live in a world in which excessive aggression/conflict is a\npotential threat to the entire biosphere and all sentient life. Thus, we need\nleaders who are capable of taking calculated aggressive measures after a\nthorough analysis of all available courses of action, not leaders whose\ndefault response to problematic circumstances is to use hyper-aggressive\nmilitary force, as Trump wishes to do. The world is a damn complex and\nambiguous place, but admitting this reality is not a good political strategy.\nIt's much more effective to paint the world as a simple place where things are\neither X or not-X. To do so is to commit the ['false dilemma'\nfallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma). A quintessential\nexample is a much-cited statement made by George W. Bush in 2001: \"Either you\nare with us, or you are with the terrorists.\" It comforts people to tell them\nthat things must be either this or that because it makes them feel that they\nunderstand the insanely complex bramble of global affairs that no individual\nhuman actually understands en toto. Trump is brilliant at reducing the\ncomplexity of the world to black-and-white narratives. One of his favorites is\nthe narrative of Winners vs Losers. In Trump's story, America has been\nunambiguously losing in recent memory; America is becoming a perma-loser\nbefore our eyes, and we're just getting used to it. Wiki Commons Of course,\nwith Trump as president, America is going to start winning again in all\nregards. \"We're going to start winning so much that you're going to get used\nto winning instead of getting used to losing,\" he has said. Does it even make\nsense to conceive of individual countries as \"winners\" or \"losers\" in a world\nwhere the future of our entire species and all life on Earth is potentially at\nstake? Probably not. Yet Trump's black-and-white narrative appeals to our\ndesire for simple, digestible stories and our American hyper-competitiveness.\nAnd again, when people are afraid and angry, they are primed to accept\nwhatever convenient narrative promises to allow them to escape their fear, and\nthus the absurdly vague and reductive America is Going to Start Winning So\nMuch Again That We'll Have Nothing to Worry About story begins to seem quite\nalluring indeed. One downside of portraying yourself as the Big Strong Man is\nthat there will still always be situations in which someone gets the best of\nyou, making you appear foolish or weak. Donald Trump has found himself in this\nsituation on a number of occasions. One of the most notable was a situation in\nwhich Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly confronted Trump about past comments in\nwhich Trump had called women he disliked \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and\ndisgusting animals.\" This question was a potential landmine for Trump, but he\ninterrupted Megyn Kelly halfway through her question by saying, \"Only Rosie\nO'Donnell.\" This comment caused an uproar of laughter in the audience and all\nbut derailed the inquiry into Trump's juvenile and dehumanizing remarks. Trump\nhas perfected this strategy of deflecting potential threats through the use of\nhumor. As Charlie Houpert put it: \"So that is the power of laughter. It is a\npattern interrupt[ion]. You can't stay booing and upset and angry when\nsomebody makes you uncontrollably laugh. It also makes you more receptive to\nwhatever comes next that somebody has to say because they've already started\nto lead you emotionally. So what Donald Trump is doing is using laughter to\ntake control of situations where he's starting to lose control. And what that\ndoes for him is it effectively helps him dodge any points that you make\nagainst him because he can almost erase them with a laughing crowd.\" Humor\nisn't Trump's only strategy for avoiding discussion of some of the more\ncontentious issues in his record. Another favorite strategy of his is to\nsimply act superior to all opponents and criticisms. In one of the GOP\ndebates, Jeb Bush attempted to point out that Donald Trump had completely\nchanged his stance on ISIS in a matter of two months. As Jeb was saying this,\nTrump didn't even pay him the courtesy of looking in his direction. Instead,\nhe looked only at the audience with an expression of disbelief and disgust\nthat said, \"Who is this guy?\" This maneuver indicates to the audience that\nBush's attack is ridiculous, laughable, not even worthy of attention, allowing\nTrump to bypass any sort of rational discussion. By contrast, when Trump\nattacked Bush, Bush looked directly at Trump with an expression of distress\nand disconcertedness, playing perfectly into Trump's game. Jeb appeared to be\nsomething of a confused and insecure novice looking to Big Daddy Trump for\nanswers. This point is related to the previous two, but it deserves emphasis.\nTrump's power plays -- whether making jokes in the face of criticism or acting\nsuperior to other candidates -- are all aimed at making him appear as the\nleader of a game in which everyone else is merely a player. In [social\ndynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dynamics), this is referred to\nas \"frame control.\" Trump frames every interaction as if he is unquestionably\nsuperior to those around him, as if everyone else is in his world. When it\ncomes to politics, whichever politician has the strongest and most unflinching\nframe will make that frame a perceived reality. And Trump is very good at\nunflinchingly selling his frame. As a billionaire, thick-skinned businessman,\nhe's been practicing this tactic for decades. Combine this with his fear-\nmongering, anger-mongering, and presenting himself as the One Great Strong\nSolution to Loser America, and you've got a potent combination of factors\ncoming together to make Donald Trump appear to be an untouchable, iron-willed\nleader in comparison to his opponents. Another of Trump's favorite tactics\n(and another form of frame control) is to trap other candidates in double-bind\nsituations. Essentially, this means that he puts them in positions where it\ndoesn't matter what they say or how they react to him -- however they respond,\nhe will come out looking better and they will come out looking worse. Charlie\nHoupert [cites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LR6EA91zLo) the example of\nTrump taunting Jeb Bush about having low energy during one of the GOP debates.\nTrump says, \"I know you're trying to build up your energy, Jeb, but it's not\nworking.\" In the face of such a statement, Jeb Bush has two options: to try to\nratchet his energy up or keep it where it is/take it down a notch. If he\nchooses the former, he appears to be reacting to Trump, making Trump look like\nhe's in control. If he chooses the latter, he remains low-energy and Trump can\njust steamroll him throughout the debate. It's a lose-lose situation for Jeb\nBush, and this is the power of a double-bind. Donald Trump repeats emotionally\nprovocative words like \"strong\" and \"win\" over and over and over. The\n[second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LR6EA91zLo) of Charlie Houpert's\nvideos shows one absurd clip in which Trump manages to say the word \"win\" 12\ntimes in about 15 seconds. This tactic [subtly\nconditions](http://changingminds.org/principles/repetition.htm) people to\nassociate strength and victory with the Trump campaign. You might think that\nthis tactic is silly or would only be effective on unintelligent people, but\nyou'd be wrong. There's a reason large companies pour millions of dollars into\nad campaigns with catchy taglines and jingles: through sheer repetition,\ncertain associations become embedded in the mind, if only on an unconscious\nlevel. Watch the documentary Century of the Self sometime if you don't believe\nme. Trump loves to hammer social proof. He repeats over and over and over that\nhe's ahead in the polls or that people agree he won a particular debate. As\nsocial creatures, we have a distinct and sometimes malignant tendency to do\nand believe whatever we think everyone else is doing and believing. Trump\nunderstands the importance of this fact, and so at every turn, he acts as if\nhe has an army of people behind him. Trump is also very careful to avoid\nnegative social proof. For instance, at one point Trump appeared on the\nO'Reilly Factor, and Bill O'Reilly suggested that people had seen Trump as a\n\"buffoon\" when he first announced his campaign. Trump outright rejected this\nstatement, acted as if it was outrageous, and assured the audience that people\ndid not feel that way. He was very deliberate and forceful about this because\nhe knows that what people think other people think is one of the most potent\nforces driving human belief and behavior. His decades in business almost\ncertainly ingrained that lesson into his mind. Trump loves to assert that\nauthority figures approve of him and disapprove of other candidates. The\nsecond video of Charlie Houpert's cites Trump saying, \"Larry Kudlow likes my\ntax plan,\" and \"Experts wonder if Cruz can run the US because he was born in\nCanada.\" Trump understands that especially in our uncertain [postmodern\nworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) with its endless sources\nof competing information, people look to experts to form their opinions. There\nis also a cognitive bias known as the [Asch\neffect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority#Psychological_basis)\nthat is relevant here. From Wikipedia: \"In repeated and modified instances of\nthe Asch conformity experiments, it was found that high-status individuals\ncreate a stronger likelihood of a subject agreeing with an obviously false\nconclusion, despite the subject normally being able to clearly see that the\nanswer was incorrect. So not only do we tend to feel pressure to conform with\nthe herd, but we also feel pressure to agree with high-status individuals.\nHere's an off-the-cuff armchair-evolutionary-psych explanation for this\nphenomenon: When our ancestors lived as bands of hunter-gatherers, it was\nbeneficial to have an extraordinary level of cohesion of belief and action in\na given tribe; it was often a matter of life or death. Thus, tribes in which\npeople unquestioningly accepted the worldview passed on by wise elders and\nreadily conformed to the herd mentality would be more likely to survive.\nAnyway, for whatever reason, we're much more likely to believe something if an\nauthority figure or expert tells us it's true. Trump understands this and\ntakes advantage of it at every turn. This might come as a surprise, but humans\nactually suck at making rational decisions and are much more likely to make\nemotion-driven decisions. This is a great thing a lot of the time because in\nmany areas of life, our emotions and feelings are excellent indicators of an\nappropriate course of action. But when it comes to choosing the leader of one\nof the most powerful countries in the world, it might be a bad idea to vote\nfor a guy because his smile gives you the warm fuzzies. Unfortunately, it's\ndamn difficult for humans to use rationality, especially if they haven't been\ntrained to think critically or haven't researched the various cognitive biases\nthat result in inaccurate thinking. Donald Trump knows that most people make\ntheir decisions on the basis of emotion rather than reason. He also knows that\nthere are certain methods of manipulating people's emotions to get them to do\nwhat you want. Most all of the items on this list -- from fear-/anger-\nmongering and deflection via humor to repetition, social proof, and appeal to\nauthority -- are effective methods of making people feel very confident about\na position, despite the fact that they haven't considered any statistical\nevidence or rational arguments. Donald Trump understands this, and that's why\nyou'll never see him engaging in a rational discussion of the issues or of the\ncriticisms levied against him. When challenged to do so, Trump will deflect\nvia humor, appeal to vague authorities or social proof, or utilize some sort\nof half-relevant anecdote to appeal to emotion and distract from his\nshortcomings. As I said before, Donald Trump isn't the only one playing the\nmanipulation game. Other candidates also understand that people are emotional\ncreatures, and any candidate who wants to have a chance of winning must use\nsome or all of these tactics. Such is the nature of American democracy in\n2016. What's frightening about Trump is that he's so damn good at playing this\ngame. He's spent decades learning the subtle art of being a dominant social\npresence and persuading people to do what he wants them to do. His actual\nvalues and ideas could be egregiously ill-conceived. Hell, they could be a\nrecipe for World War III. But because he's such a talented hypnotist\npolitician, his actual values and ideas don't matter that much. If he wins the\nrace, it will be because he effectively encouraged and harnessed the fear,\nanger, and emotion-driven decision-making of a large portion of the American\npublic. Personally, I would prefer not to find out what happens to America\nafter electing one of the most effective fear- and anger-mongers [since, uh,\nAdolf Hitler](http://www.cracked.com/blog/why-comparing-donald-trump-to-\nhitler-makes-perfect-sense/). I would prefer not to find out if a man who has\nspent the last 30 years plastering his name on everything he could put his\nname on gives two shits about the interests of most Americans. I would prefer\nnot to find out if a businessman with no political experience is prepared to\napproach the challenges of the presidency with wisdom and acumen. I would\nprefer not to find out if Trump's hard-ass, violence-friendly approach to\npolitical problems is as dangerous for planet Earth as I think it is. If you\nfound this article educational or important in any way, please pass it on to\nyour friends. 1. Don't get me wrong: I like Bernie and would likely vote for\nhim if he were to get the nomination. All I'm saying is that he's playing the\ngame too, and that in reality, he had no choice but to play the game if he\nwanted to have any chance of winning. 2. One could also argue that an\nextremely passive or pacifistic US President could inadvertently cause a\nWorld-War-III situation by failing to take action to neutralize dangerous\ngroups or leaders who are gaining power. Some argue that this is essentially\n[what happened pre-World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement).\nMy view is that we need leaders who are capable of taking aggressive measures\nafter a thorough analysis of all available courses of action, not leaders\nwhose default response to problematic circumstances is to use hyper-aggressive\nmilitary force. 3.

Talley is 36 years old, has only practiced law for three years and\nmade a series of partisan comments on his blog in 2016 that would normally be\nconsidered unbecoming of a judge, like referring to the Democratic\npresidential candidate as \"Hillary Rotten Clinton,\" [according to the Los\nAngeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-\njudge-20171110-story.html). Although Talley does have degrees from the\nUniversity of Alabama and Harvard Law School and clerked for two federal\njudges, he has never argued a motion, making it nearly unprecedented for him\nto be considered as a candidate for a lifetime appointment. One of Talley's\nmost controversial statements was a blog post in which he claimed that\nPresident Barack Obama was \"about to launch the greatest attack on our\nconstitutional freedoms in our lifetime.\" He added, \"The object of that war is\nto make guns illegal, in all forms.\" After a commenter wrote that Americans\nwould \"resort to arms when our other rights -- of speech, press, assembly,\nrepresentative government -- fail to yield the desired results,\" Talley said\nhe agreed with him. When asked about these statements by the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee, Talley said he was merely \"trying to generate discussion. I wanted\npeople to be able to use my blog to discuss issues, to come together and find\ncommon ground.\" The president has directly praised Talley as being an \"untold\nstory\" that \"nobody wants to talk about.\" \"When you think of it, Mitch\n[McConnell] and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending\non the age of the judge,\" Trump said in October. \"But 40 years out.\" One other\nfactor that may have contributed to Talley's nomination: He was mentored by\nSen. Luther Strange of Alabama and worked in the Justice Department office\nthat chooses judicial nominees. Talley isn't the only Trump judicial nominee\nwho has been the subject of [raised\nquestions](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/17/trump-judges-nominees-\ncourt-picks-243834). Charles Goodwin, who was nominated to the federal bench\nin Oklahoma, was the first judicial nominee since 2006 to receive a \"not\nqualified\" label from the American Bar Association. Jeff Mateer, who was\nnominated to the federal bench in Texas, aroused controversy by referring to\ntransgender children as proof of \"Satan's plan\" and denounced the Supreme\nCourt decision legalizing gay marriage as \"disgusting.\" John Bush, who was\nconfirmed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote a blog post arguing that\nslavery and abortion were the \"two greatest tragedies in our country.\"\n\n",

            "input": "In recent months, late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel has taken to\nscaremongering his audience with well-worn Democratic Party talking points\nregarding health care insurance policy. Between yuks, he occasionally accuses\nRepublicans of being would-be baby killers, which is treated as an important\npolitical development because, well, Jimmy Kimmel is famous. This week, the\ncomedian was back to explain why the new Graham-Cassidy Republican \"repeal\"\nbill is bad news. There were only two things wrong with his monologue: Almost\neverything he said was either completely untrue or highly misleading, and his\nsimplistic emotional appeal was completely disconnected from the real world.\nThe comedian's interest in policy was sparked by the harrowing experience of\nhaving a newborn son who suffered from a rare health condition. Thankfully,\nhis boy is OK. \"If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it\nshouldn't matter how much money you make,\" said an emotional Kimmel in May. \"I\nthink that's something that, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or\nsomething else, we all agree on that, right?\" Yes, everyone agrees. As far as\nI know, there isn't a single politician in America who has ever supported\nallowing babies to die because they are born with birth defects, even if the\nparents can't pay. Not pre-Obamacare, and not post-Obamacare. In any event,\nafter Kimmel's May rant, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy showed up on his show to\nexplain his position. These types of culture encounters shouldn't be\ndismissed, because the fact is most viewers are unaware of specific policies\nand have a notional understanding that's prejudiced by the establishment\nmedia's coverage. Cassidy came up with something he called the \"Jimmy Kimmel\nTest,\" a test that no \"family should be denied medical care, emergency or\notherwise, because they can't afford it.\" Kimmel claims that the new bill\ndoesn't meet this threshold. \"This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my\nface,\" the talk-show host said on Tuesday night during an extended political\nrant. He went on to say, \"And by the way, before you post a nasty Facebook\nmessage saying I'm politicizing my son's health problems, I want you to know:\nI am politicizing my son's health problems.\" OK. He explained: \"Coverage for\nall? No. Fact, it will kick about 30 million Americans off insurance.\" Not a\nsingle person would be \"kicked off\" his or her insurance. Rather, the\nCongressional Budget Office review of the AHCA found that of the 24 million\nAmericans who would no longer have health insurance after an Obamacare repeal,\n14 million would choose not to buy insurance in 2018 in the absence of a\npenalty. And if Obamacare were not repealed, the CBO projects another 6\nmillion people would voluntarily leave the Obamacare markets. Now, if you\ndon't believe Americans should be afforded the choice to leave or not buy\ninsurance, just say that. No one is being kicked off. Moreover, if Kimmel\nsupports the individual mandate, Graham-Cassidy allows California to institute\nit -- as I am sure it would. Kimmel says: \"Pre-existing conditions? Nope. If\nthe bill passes, individual states can let insurance companies charge more if\nyou have a pre-existing condition.\" States would be allowed to apply for\nwaivers to change what qualifies as an essential health benefit as long as\nthey still preserve \"adequate and affordable health insurance coverage\" for\npeople with pre-existing conditions. You may prefer price fixing to allowing\nstates flexibility to try and fix these problems, but Graham-Cassidy does not\nbreak the \"Jimmy Kimmel Test.\" Kimmel might not be aware that there is no plan\nin place that has government cutting checks after every surgery. Kimmel then\nimplored his audience to call Cassidy to stop the imaginary bill he had just\ndescribed. It's a shame that Kimmel didn't provide a number to call for the\ntens of millions of Americans who have seen their premiums and out-of-pocket\ncosts skyrocket under Obamacare's strictures. Is there no number available for\nthose who are sick of being in exchanges that coerce them to buy plans they\ndon't need that are sold by companies they don't like in fabricated,\nnoncompetitive \"markets\" with dwindling choices? Anyway, so went a monologue\nthat could have been written by any liberal activist. Which is to say it was\nall about cheap zero-sum emotionalism. Kimmel doesn't believe Americans\ndeserve the chance to reduce the cost of health care with market-based reforms\non the state level, or in giving states any flexibility in catering their\nplans to their own citizens. Kimmel believes California and New York should\nspend more per capita and smaller states should suffer. Kimmel doesn't believe\nthat individuals and families should be allowed to contribute to health\nsavings accounts or use them to help pay ever-growing insurance premiums.\nKimmel wants average Americans to suffer. You see? Anyone can play this game.\nCOPYRIGHT 2017 CREATORS.COM Stunning Video Will Make Any Atheist's Jaw Drop\n\n",

Email us at [email protected] for more\ninformation. Everyone knows and loves Gupta Patel - Turtleboy's crazy Indian\nTech Guy and proud convenience store proprietor. He's never blogged for us\nbefore but something caught his eye in the news that sent him reeling. Let's\ngive him a warm welcome as he has a meltdown about the statehouse deciding to\nteach kids as young as 12 how to safely take it in the back door! Your uncle\nGupta read this one news article last night and choke on his Vodka Slushee!\nLast Thursday, the Massachusetts Senate passed new sex education package by a\n31-6 vote in favor. Look like the usual\n[chutiyas](http://www.youswear.com/index.asp?language=Gujarati) in the\nstatehouse been drinking the same strange flavor KoolAid again.  Take a look\nat this nutty-ass booshit: [From New Boston\nPost](http://newbostonpost.com/2017/07/20/anal-sex-ed-bill-passes-\nmassachusetts-senate/)-- As it did in 2015, the Massachusetts Senate passed a\nbill nearly entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school\ndistricts teach sex education; and just like two years ago, the biggest\nsticking point for the bill's opponents was the lack of an opt-in stipulation\nfor parents and guardians. Unlike in 2015, however, it is likely this version\nof the bill will reach the House floor for a vote, but it remains to be seen\nif lawmakers on the other side of the State House attach the failed parental\nopt-in amendment touted Thursday by House Minority Leader Bruce Tarr\n(R-Gloucester). Following the 31-6 vote in favor that saw the only Democratic\nopposition come from state Senator Michael Rush of West Roxbury, Tarr praised\nthe \"robust and healthy debate\" that transpired Thursday afternoon but\nexpressed \"hope that as it makes its way through the legislative process\" that\nlawmakers outside the Senate will wind up adopting proposals like a parental\nconsent stipulation. The bill's lead sponsor, state Senator Sal DiDomenico\n(D-Everett) took issue with Tarr's opt-in proposal. \"This amendment would gut\nthe bill,\" DiDomenico claimed, noting that the legislation already features an\nopt-out amendment for both parents and school districts. \"This amendment would\neffectively take all the work we put together and throw it out the window. \"We\ndo not have opt-in for science, math, English -- we don't have any opt-in\ninitiative for any other subjects in our schools -- this subject in particular\ncould save lives.\" Other Democrats who spoke out in opposition to Tarr's\namendment included state Senator John Keenan of Quincy, Worcester's Harriet\nChandler, and Boston's Sonia Chang-Diaz. Keenan and Chang-Diaz added that a\nparental consent requirement would add an unnecessary level of bureaucracy,\nwith Keenan claiming that it \"would require school districts to chase down the\nparents of every single student\" while Chang-Diaz noting that \"many of my\ncolleagues in the chamber in the minority are avid proponents of small\nstreamlined government.\" Chandler claimed that an opt-in provision would\nresult in a \"very limited number of people who would be taking advantage of\nit.\" \"The alternative of what we're talking about is our children learning\nabout these behaviors from what they hear on the school bus or read on the\nInternet,\" she added. State Senator Vinny deMacedo (R-Plymouth), responding to\nKeenan's point, used student field trips as an example of opt-in protocol. \"I\ndon't think that's an impossible hurdle to overcome,\" he said. \"The reality is\nthat asking parents if they're comfortable with this or not is not a stretch\nby any means.\" Tarr appeared to take issue with the claim linking parental\napproval to an added layer of bureaucracy. \"Well well well, it is interesting\nthat some of these folks have stood at this microphone and suggested somehow\nthat obtaining parental consent is so burdensome that we shouldn't follow\nthrough with this,\" Tarr quipped. \"Suggesting that the role of a parent should\nbe subordinate to the role of bureaucracy, now that's a deeply concerning\nthought.\" Tarr also challenged DiDomenico's claim that an opt-in provision\nwould \"gut the bill.\" \"That somehow this bill is jeopardized by the fact that\nwe might want to involve parents in the decision making -- what does that\nsuggest about the priorities of the bill?\" Tarr questioned. \"It suggests that\nsomehow we ought to subordinate the role of the parent to the role of the\nstate. \"It's also been suggested that we don't have opt-in provisions for\nmath, science, and other things, well that is true, but we also don't have\nopt-out provisions for those things, because they don't fit the same matter as\nthe subject matter that we're discussing here.\" Conservative organizations,\nincluding the Massachusetts Family Institute, are vehemently opposed to the\nbill over the proposed curriculum's subject matter, which suggests that\ninstruction regarding sexual aspects such as [anal intercourse is age-\nappropriate for children as young as\n12.](http://newbostonpost.com/2017/07/18/should-your-12-year-old-be-forced-to-\nlearn-anal-sex/)Some of the instructional material approved by state education\nofficials was created by Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. \"If you\nhave to have an affirmative act from a parent in order to go on a school trip,\nshould you not have to have the affirmative act of a parent to be involved in\neducation that involves morality, subjective judgment, and important health\nmatters?\" Tarr said. \"I think the matter speaks for itself.\" DiDomenico\nresponded to Tarr's argument by noting he is not looking to subvert the role\nof parents and countered that he \"would put this in the same category as\nEnglish, math, and science.\" \"In some respects I'd put it ahead of those\nsubjects,\" DiDomenico added. \"There are life-ending, life-long consequences,\nand a critical mistake can change their lives forever.\" State Senator Barbara\nL'Italien (D-Andover) also spoke, mentioning an incident in which her older\nsister became pregnant during high school. \"Getting married at age 17 locked\nher into a life of virtual poverty,\" L'Italien said. \"I wish there had been\naccurate health information when she was a student back in the '70s, I think\nher life might have changed dramatically. \"There are times when government\nneeds to be proactive, and protective, and this is one of those situations.\"\nSweet Baby Vishnu!

This Hindu had the very very bad nightmares after reading this\nnews! In my dream, my daughter, Gupta Jr, was back in the grade school. I was\nwatching my favorite American movie \"Mansion of Blood\" and Mindy Robinson was\njust about to show all the peoples her hot hot Samosas when my daughter come\nrunning through the door, She say \"Papa! Papa! I have the question about the\nsex!\" And I say \"Yes my little one, I have been preparing for this\nconversation long time. Ask your papa your questions\". She say \"Papa, when\nwill it stop hurting my ass so much?\" Your old Uncle Gupta almost had the bad\nheart attacks! \"As it did in 2015, the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill\nnearly entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts\nteach sex education; and just like two years ago, the biggest sticking point\nfor the bill's opponents was the lack of an opt-in stipulation for parents and\nguardians.\" Really? Uncle Gupta think the biggest sticking point probably\ngonna be the anal sex. Seriously though. You can opt out of goddamn Pledge of\nAllegiance in school in Massachusetts without facing the punishments, but you\ncan't opt out of learning how to send your pork soldier to the battle in\nBrownsville? \"The bill's lead sponsor, state Senator Sal DiDomenico\n(D-Everett) took issue with Tarr's opt-in proposal. \"This amendment would gut\nthe bill,\" DiDomenico claimed, noting that the legislation already features an\nopt-out amendment for both parents and school districts. \"This amendment would\neffectively take all the work we put together and throw it out the window. \"We\ndo not have opt-in for science, math, English -- we don't have any opt-in\ninitiative for any other subjects in our schools -- this subject in particular\ncould save lives.\" Ganesha, please take me now, These\n[chutiyas](http://www.youswear.com/index.asp?language=Gujarati) gonna drive\nthis humble Hindu to carnivorism. \"Johnny, study the maths and the science\ngood so you can be great physicist someday!\" \"Susie! finish your English\nhomeworks so you can be excellent writer someday.\" Mary!

State Senator Barbara L'Italien (D-Andover)\nalso spoke, mentioning an incident in which her older sister became pregnant\nduring high school. \"Getting married at age 17 locked her into a life of\nvirtual poverty,\" L'Italien said. \"I wish there had been accurate health\ninformation when she was a student back in the '70s, I think her life might\nhave changed dramatically. Ms. Barbarabhen! Did you really just say \"Damn, my\nsister's life would be so much better now if only she had taken the rusty\ntrombone in her swamp starfish that one time instead of in her hoo-ha.\"?? It\nTake one real classy lady to say she wishes her niece or nephew had taken a\nwrong turn down Willy Wonka's garbage chute. Uncle Gupta don't think it's too\nstrange that Barbara L'Italien advocating for taking it from the behind.\nNobody gonna want to be looking at this in the face during the hot nookie-\nnookie session..  Holy mother of Kali! Blowjob from this one probably count as\nanal anyways. No surprise here really . Both L'Italien and Chandler recently\nvote to give themselves fat pay hike, so they have lot of experience stuffing\nthe pepperonis in the peoples hot pockets. This one Hindu here don't know\nabout you, but when I see Hariette Chandler's face, the first thing that come\nto mind not going to be anal sex:  Sweet baby Hannuman! Her ass probably look\nlike dying Yoda's forehead. Going to work up her Lincoln Log Factory probably\nsound like punching a fist into the open jar of Miracle Whip! (Miracle Whip!\nTwo jars for five dollar at my Main South Happy Hindu Mart Convenience Store\nin Worcester. Next five minute only.) She so old her dunghole probably look\nlike the hopper on a meat grinder after Porketta night. This one Sonia Chang-\nDiaz though?  Would. This Hindu just saying. \"There are times when government\nneeds to be proactive, and protective, and this is one of those situations.\" I\nagreeing that government should be protective and proactive. Maybe if they had\nvoted to give the Police the Kevlar Vests instead of giving their fat samosa\nasses big raise it would have been good start. Educating the 12 years old\nchild about anal sex? Not so much. You know what going to happen in the class\nfull of 12 years old kids when teacher start talking about the anal and oral\nsex? Gonna be like comedy scene in bad Hindi movie. Maybe not during class,\nbut afterwards they gonna make the fun. \"Rectum? Damn near killed him!\" joke\ngonna get old real quick in the cafeteria. State Legislators are calling this\nbill the \"Healthy Youth Act\". That really nice way of putting it. As usual\nwith these \"Dheela Lund Ni Olaad\" (That my Gujarati language for \"Sons of the\nbroken penis\"), the devil is in the details…and Uncle Gupta all about the\ndetails! One of the textbooks approved in the bill is called \"Get Real:\nComprehensive Sex Education That Works,\" put out by the Planned Parenthood.\nBook is only available in bundles of 50, and this thrifty Indian man not\nbuying if he can't find the coupon or get the good deal. I ferret couple\npassages out on the internets for you. You're welcome. One lesson teaches the\nchildrens that A dental dam is \"placed over the vulva or anus during oral\nsex\". Then it goes on to say the people can also use the \"Non-Microwaveable\nSaran Wrap\". Papa Gupta spend most of his daughter's pre-teen years yelling at\nher to do the healthy things. \"Don't touch that! Do not step in the dog mess!\nDon't put the statue of Baby Krishna in your mouth! Wash Your hands before\neating! Use the Purell after shaking Senator McGovern's hand!\". Now, she would\nhave to go to school next day and learn how to toss the big salad?? It's ok\nthough…. Happy Hindu Mart sell plenty of non-microwaveable Saran Wrap. This\nhandsome Indian TurtleBoy don't think Saran Wrap company be too happy knowing\nsex education class teaching the children to use their product to cover the\nchocolate cannoli. Another lesson talk about using the \" internal condom that\nis inserted into the anus.\" They say it acts as a barrier but warns that \"it\nmay slip out of place during vaginal or anal intercourse and may be difficult\nto insert.\" Wait…what you say? I had to call my cousin the Gastroenterologist\nabout this one. Dr. Dharmendra Tubupyeresh. I say \"Hey, Dharmendra, you ever\nhear of such thing?\" He say to me \"Gupta, you been lighting up the porn hub\nagain? Yes there is such the thing.\" He send me over this picture. \"Insert two\nfingers inside the condom and gently push it into the anal cavity. The inner\nring can be removed after inserted if desired.\" Lovely. 12 year old gonna\nlearn how to shove the ziplock bag up the friend's wazoo before doing the\nzoom-zoom in the boom-boom. When Uncle Gupta first read this news, he knew\nsomething smell funny…and not just the anal sex! Then this bald prick rears\nhis ugly head and everything make sense… Senator Jamie Eldridge. You might\nremember him from such blogs as these. This bhenchod one real professional\nturtle poking man! In my former country he would not have been problem because\nwe would have already kill him already. Notice how he don't tweet about the\ncontent of the bill…only that the Mass Senate GOP (all six of them) oppose it.\nLet me tell you something, Senator Jamie…nobody going to oppose young adults\nlearning the safe ways to make the sweet nookie-nookie, but not letting\nparents opt them out? What kind of glass dinka-doodle you been smoking from?\nThis Hindu gets it. Too many kids having the sex at young age… Definitely\nshould be options available to teach healthy sexual practices to children, but\nif any citizen ever texted the contents of some of these lessons to a child,\nthey would go to the prison. And we all know what happen in prison. Dunghole\ncome out looking like Saarlac sand monster from the Return of the Jedi.\nAnyway, this Hindu try hard to reach these senators on Twitter but they not\nresponding. Wonder why.  Namaste TurtleBoy Nations! May the supple trunk of\nGanesha goose your buttocks!\n\n",

Pence's flight from Las Vegas to Indianapolis\nSaturday took about three hours and 20 minutes, so it cost about $100,000.\nPence then flew from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on Sunday, which took about\nfour hours and 45 minutes, costing about $142,500. The grand total: about\n$242,500. Keep in mind this is just for the plane. It does not include any of\nthe ancillary costs that accrue anytime the vice president travels anywhere.\nThere were increased security costs to local police once Pence was on the\nground in Indianapolis. Costs to locals stuck in traffic as roads were likely\nclosed for his motorcade. Costs to the Colts to increase security at the\nstadium. And so on. All so Pence could release a statement that was the\nequivalent of his infamous stern gaze across the Demilitarized Zone at North\nKorea: I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not\ndignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National\nAnthem. At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their\ncourage, resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around\nour Flag and everything that unites us. While everyone is entitled to their\nown opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the\nFlag and our National Anthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand with our\nsoldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.\nPence's office would like you to think this was just a spontaneous reaction by\na man proud of his flag and his nation. This is belied by the fact that his\nreporters traveling with him were [not allowed\nout](https://twitter.com/ElizLanders/status/917091068797161472) of their vans\nwhen they arrived at the Colts' stadium but were told ahead of time that\n\"there may be an early departure from the game by VPOTUS.\" It is also belied\nby this tweet sent Sunday afternoon by Donald Trump: I asked\n[@VP](https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Pence to leave stadium if\nany players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and\n[@SecondLady](https://twitter.com/SecondLady?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Karen. The\nColts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, the former team of Colin\nKaepernick, who started the kneeling protests a year ago. The chances that\nMike Pence would see players kneeling were approximately 100 percent. He knew\nthis ahead of time, yet he still chose to fly from Las Vegas to Indianapolis\ndespite the fact that he had to fly back to California immediately afterwards\nfor fundraisers, just so he could get a picture of himself holding his hand\nover his heart (a picture his staff immediately made the header photo on his\nTwitter page) before theatrically storming out and scolding the NFL players\nfor offending him. A real leader might have tried to find out exactly why the\nplayers started kneeling in the first place, which was to protest police\nbrutality and racism, and then spoken with them and tried to figure out ways\nto address their concerns. Mike Pence did the exact opposite. As of Monday\nmorning, he has yet to make a peep about the white nationalists returning to\nCharlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday night to once again rally around the\nRobert E. Lee statue there. That he is seemingly far more concerned with\nstaging a political stunt slapping down African-American players protesting\nsystemic racism tells you all you need to know about him. Oh, and to top it\noff, one of the fundraisers Pence is attending in California is for Dana\nRohrabacher, the strongly pro-Russia congressman. Fiction writers could not\nmake this up.

I regret those\ncomments that [Trump] made,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan during a [press\nconference Tuesday](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/07/politics/paul-ryan-donald-\ntrump-racist-comment/index.html). \"Claiming a person can't do their job\nbecause of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist\ncomment … it's absolutely unacceptable.\" And Sen. Mark Kirk, a Republican from\nIllinois facing a tough reelection battle this year, flat out withdrew his\nsupport for his party's nominee, saying \"Donald Trump's belief that an\nAmerican-born judge of Mexican descent is incapable of fairly presiding over\nhis case is not only dead wrong, it is un-American.\" Last week, Trump charged\nthat his plan to build a wall between the U.S.-Mexican border was \"an absolute\nconflict\" of interest, charging to the [Wall Street\nJournal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-\ngonzalo-curiel-1464911442) that Curiel could not preside fairly over the Trump\nUniversity case because he is \"of Mexican heritage.\" (Curiel was born in\nIndiana to Mexican immigrants.) Speaking again to CNN's Jake Tapper last\nFriday, Trump [maintained his\nposition](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/03/politics/donald-trump-tapper-\nlead/index.html): \"He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and\nMexico.\" When Tapper asked if, by saying that Curiel could not due his job\nbecause of his race, \"is that not the definition of racism?\" Trump responded,\n\"No, I don't think so at all.\" Amid the fierce backlash from his own party,\nTrump put together a damage-control statement late Tuesday promising not to\nsay anything more about Curiel or the lawsuit - after this: \"It is unfortunate\nthat my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people\nof Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of\nMexican and Hispanic descent. … While this lawsuit should have been dismissed,\nit is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this\nmatter any further.\" Just one day earlier, Trump encouraged supporters on a\nprivate conference call on Monday to join his chorus by publicly questioning\nthe judge's credibility, two participants on the call told [Bloomberg\nPolitics](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-06/trump-orders-\nsurrogates-to-intensify-criticism-of-judge-and-journalists). Several\nRepublican politicians, including former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown,\nwere involved in the call, during which Trump overturned a Sunday email from\nhis staff that ordered his most prominent supporters - those surrogates who\nspeak for him on cable news talk shows and at campaign appearances - to cease\nall talk of the lawsuit and Curiel. \"Take that order and throw it the hell\nout,\" Trump said on the call, according to Bloomberg Politics. Is Hillary\nClinton Intimidated by Donald Trump? Numerous other prominent Republicans have\njoined Ryan in disavowing Trump's sentiments, including South Carolina's\njunior senator Tim Scott - the Senate's only black Republican - who [told\nCNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/06/politics/republicans-donald-trump-judge-\nracism/) the commentary is \"racially toxic.\" Added Arnold Schwarzenegger on\nTwitter, \"Judge Curiel is an American hero who stood up to the Mexican\ncartels. I was proud to appoint him when I was Gov.\" Freshly-minted\npresumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also issued a warning on Monday\nthat Trump may next focus his attacks on \"women judges … or maybe a judge with\na disability, or perhaps one who was a former POW, or African-American.\" \"He's\ntrying to demean and defame a federal judge who was a very accomplished\nfederal prosecutor,\" she continued [on MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-\nmaddow/watch/clinton-trump-judge-smear-dangerous-nonsense-700286531849). \"This\nis dangerous nonsense that undermines the rule of law, that makes him appear\nto be someone who has no respect for fellow Americans,\" Clinton said. \"And I\nthink it is yet more evidence why this man is dangerous and divisive and\ndisqualified from being president.\"\n\n",

            "input": "Brynn Anderson/AP Photo In his Alabama appearance for Roy Moore, Steve Bannon\nturned in an intellectually and morally putrid performance even by his\nstandards. There is a partisan case for voting for Moore, which is simply that\nRepublicans can't afford to lose a Senate seat over the next three years and\nMoore's failings must be ignored or rationalized away for the larger good of\nthe party. This is not an elevated line of reasoning and is not obviously\ncorrect on its own terms. With Democrats throwing John Conyers and Al Franken\noverboard, Senate Republicans would be welcoming into their ranks a potent\nsymbol of sexual malfeasance to be used against them in the 2018 midterms.\nIt's a better argument, though, than the tawdry justifications offered up by\nBannon, who parachuted into an already disreputable campaign and dragged it\nthrough the gutter. Bannon seems to misunderstand the nature of the\ndeplorables he seeks to lead. \"Deplorable\" is supposed to be an unfair,\ndisparaging term for people who believe reasonable but politically incorrect\nthings (immigration should be restricted, NFL players should stand during the\nnational anthem, all lives matter, etc.). It shouldn't be a license for doing\ntruly deplorable things. Democrats, at least some of them, now want to\njettison Bill Clinton and are saying that they were wrong to defend him during\nhis scandals. For his part, Bannon wants to pick up the ethics of the party of\nClinton and transfer them into the GOP. In Alabama, Bannon used that phrase\nredolent of the 1990s, \"the politics of personal destruction.\" Who is doing\nthe destroying? Why the globalists, of course. There is nothing they aren't\ncapable of. It's not clear why the globalists would be so fixated on defeating\nMoore that they'd work behind the scenes to get a bunch of women -- and\ncorroborating witnesses -- who don't know each other to lie about Moore having\na romantic interest in them when they were teenagers. It seems a lot of effort\nto defeat a man who is arguing he should be elected to provide another vote\nfor corporate tax cuts. Bannon referred to a conspiracy against Donald Trump\nin the way the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was brought to light, somewhat\njocularly. But his mind-set is deeply conspiratorial. Because there are so\nmany forces arrayed against you -- the globalists, the establishment, the\nmedia -- you are freed of any moral responsibility or standards. In fact, the\nmere mention of the words \"honor\" or \"integrity\" is a terrible provocation.\nBannon launched his scurrilous attack on Mitt Romney because the former\nRepublican presidential nominee used those terms in opposing Moore. Bannon\nshot back, in a truly perverse riff, that Moore has more honor in his \"pinkie\"\nthan the entire Romney clan; per Bannon, Moore served in Vietnam and Romney\ndidn't, and none of Romney's sons joined the military. Obviously, if going to\nVietnam and having kids who served in the military is the sole measure of\nhonor, Trump fails the test, and John McCain passes it. This doesn't stop\nBannon from considering Trump the great savior of the republic and McCain a\ndisgrace. But it's not worth trying too hard to unpack Bannon's spiel. There\nis a huge element of play-acting here. Bannon waited to see which way the wind\nwas blowing in Alabama. If Moore were still running consistently behind\nDemocrat Doug Jones, Bannon wouldn't be holding a campaign rally for him and\nchallenging Romney to come down to Alabama to prove his manhood. He'd be\nlooking to minimize the damage and shift the blame (the advantage of the\nspecter of an all-powerful establishment is that it can be blamed for\nanything). Privately, Bannon can't be thrilled that he's stuck with Moore, and\nhe must know that Moore is a kook, even if he can't admit it in public. Bannon\nlikes to attack everyone else in the party for lacking courage, but in\nAlabama, he's afraid to admit he backed a bum candidate and afraid to\nacknowledge the truth about Moore. The urgency to get the party to back Moore-\ntype candidates isn't immediately apparent. If the point is just to hold\nRepublican Senate seats, safer, more conventional Republicans are better\nsuited to the task. If the point is just to support the Trump agenda, safer,\nmore conventional candidates are as reliable, and perhaps more reliable than\nthe likes of Moore, who opposed the Graham-Cassidy health care bill (\"Rand\nPaul praises Roy Moore for opposing Obamacare repeal effort\" is how one\nheadline put it at the time). Part of the point has to be to elect candidates\nwho have no standards for the sake of it. Bannon may be thinking ahead to a\ntime when the Trump sex allegations become a live issue again or when a true\nscandal emerges from the Robert Mueller investigation. In this scenario, will\nthere be anyone more naturally inclined to be dismissive of the accusers or\nother evidence than former Judge Roy Moore? Bannon may also believe that a GOP\nwith a highly attuned ethical sense can't truly be the party of the working\nclass. In which case, who is the one who has contempt for the \"rubes\"?\n\n",

One of Bannon's strongest allies -- the Mercer family, which is\nfunding Breitbart -- issued a stinging rebuke on Thursday, but limited the\nscope of their attack to what Bannon said about the president. \"I support\nPresident Trump and the platform upon which he was elected,\" Rebekah Mercer\n[told the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-\npolitics/wp/2018/01/04/mercer-issues-rare-public-rebuke-of-former-ally-\nbannon/?utm_term=.6ba426985788). \"My family and I have not communicated with\nSteve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his\npolitical agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.\" And\nCBS reported Friday that Mercer \"cut all ties\" with Bannon because that's what\nTrump wanted her to do. .\n[@CBSNews](https://twitter.com/CBSNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) confirms Steve\nBannon's longtime benefactor Rebekah Mercer cut *all ties* with him at the\nrequest of White House officials in the aftermath of\n[#FireAndFury](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireAndFury?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).\n[pic.twitter.com/8eICjpp6Qw](https://t.co/8eICjpp6Qw) -- ryan kadro\n(@RyanKadro) [January 5,\n2018](https://twitter.com/RyanKadro/status/949256699487096832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nBut Mercer is continuing to finance Breitbart, which has not only been\nBannon's political agenda, it's been his political essence.

Their most recent concern was motivated by a [\"Free Speech Week\"\nevent](http://freespeechweek.com/) that was being put together by provocateur\nMilo Yiannopoulos, who was invited by a small campus group called Berkeley\nPatriot. He was going to appear on the campus in February, but his scheduled\nspeech was canceled after protesters prevented it from taking place. The\nupcoming event was scheduled to take place from September 24-27, but as Rick\nMoran reports in these pages, it was announced today that Berkeley Patriot\ncanceled the event. Participants initially mentioned were Steve Bannon and Ann\nCoulter, but now it has become apparent that neither planned to attend. Listed\nspeaker Charles Murray [announced](http://www.chronicle.com/article/Speaking-\nat-Berkeley-With-Milo/241226) he would not participate in any event Milo had\narranged \"because he is a despicable asshole.\" Murray's name, moreover, was\nlisted without his knowledge or consent. All of these announced speakers\nregularly enrage leftist students and send them into conniptions. To confound\nissues even more, Milo Yiannopoulos announced he would appear and speak anyway\nat the famous Sproul Plaza, the site of the 1964 Free Speech Movement protest.\nPromising surprises, he now is asserting his right to free speech as a private\ncitizen to speak on campus without any formal group sponsorship or invitation.\nSaying he would appear this Sunday at noon, there is certain to be a large\npolice presence as well as a vast group of leftist protestors, most likely\nincluding Antifa groups. The highlight at the now suspended conference was to\nbe the \"Mario Savio Award,\" given to the individual who in their eyes has most\nrepresented the idea of free speech. The name of the award is also meant to\nanger liberals. Mario Savio led the famous Berkeley protests in the 1960s.\nWhen the university moved in October of 1964 to prevent a protestor from\nspeaking, students spontaneously surrounded the police car he had been put in.\nSavio gave an eloquent speech that made him famous from on top of the police\ncar. Soon 3000 or more students arrived. Then they took over Sproul Plaza, the\nadministration building. Eventually, scores of police arrived and arrested\nthose students who had taken over the building. Now Yiannopoulos is co-opting\nthe once liberal and leftist cause of free speech as his own, and in effect\npositing that he and his associates are the ones acting in Savio's spirit. An\norganizer of the original '60s protests, playwright and author Barbara Garson,\ncalled Free Speech Week a \"grotesque parody\" of the movement she helped lead.\nAs of today -- the 23rd -- the event will not take place. Yet Milo's\nappearance -- should he show up -- has forced the university authorities to\nspend one million dollars arranging for security, since they fear the kind of\nviolence that erupted in Charlottesville when Antifa appeared to contest the\nneo-Nazis and racists who planned a rally there. It's getting very expensive\nfor conservatives to speak. Recently, Ben Shapiro spoke without incident and\nreported he had a fruitful exchange of opinion with liberal and leftist\nstudents, although security for his talk cost UC Berkeley $600,000.\n\n",

While I felt\nthe article did a fine job portraying his perspective, a friend pointed out\nsomething worrying toward the bottom. Just before the last sentence, there's a\nquote overlaying an image attributed to Voltaire. The quote reads: \"To learn\nwho rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.\" It\nis often attributed to Voltaire, although it has been\n[disputed](http://nationalvanguard.org/2017/01/voltaire-didnt-say-it/) [as to\nwhether he, in fact, said it](https://www.mediaite.com/online/to-learn-who-\nrules-over-you-viral-voltaire-quote-probably-originated-with-white-\nsupremacist/).

No one knows for sure if he did or didn't.\nAll we do know is that a random white supremacist from West Virginia also\nwrote it\n[here](https://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/Articles/Featured_Authors/strom,_kevin/kevin_strom_works/Kevin_Strom_1991-1994/Kevin_A._Strom_19930814-ADV_All_America_Must_Know_the_Terror_That_Is_Upon_Us.html)\n25 years ago. So obviously Councilor Gaffney has been brushing up on his 25\nyear old West Virginia white supremacist literature. Either that or he, just\nlike many progressives and conservatives before him, believe this is a\nVoltaire quote. Anyone with a brain could see what Buttmunch Billy was trying\nto do here. He doesn't like Gaffney because he's a social justice warrior. He\ntries to play if off like he's just \"reporting the news\" but he doesn't do a\nvery good job hiding it. Keep in mind that the Turtlegram and Gazette called\nGaffney a \"slave master\" two years ago for investigating a fraudulent non-\nprofit that just so happened to be run by a black woman. They act like it's\nharmless to throw these labels out there. It's not. And what I love about\nGaffney is that he's not afraid to fire back at these frauds, which is exactly\nwhat he did on his Facebook page last night: Juicy!!! Walter Bird didn't write\nthe blurb, but his newest employee did. I'm sure Walter appreciates Buttmunch\nBilly dragging him into a world of shit that is Turtleboy blowback. But what\nchoice did Gaffney have? We're the only media outlet in town that tells the\ntruth. The rest are clearly against him, so why should he place nice with them\nany longer? Either way, Walter is the editor. He approved of this. He allowed\nhis newest employee to insinuate that the Vice Chairman of the City Council\nquotes white supremacists. Buttmunch Billy quickly objected on Gaffney's\nFacebook page: Yea Mike. He didn't actually call you a racist. He just\ninsinuated that you are inspired by white supremacist literature and freely\nquote them in order to push your agenda in Worcester. What's the harm? YIKES!!\nInstead of just apologizing and admitting he fucked up, Buttmunch Billy\ndoubled down and said that he was NOT insinuating any racism on his part: Yea\ndude, no one believes you. You're not good at lying. You don't go out of your\nway to research a meme's origins, and then attribute it solely to a white\nsupremacist, unless you're trying to tie Gaffney to that particular white\nsupremacist. We're not as stupid as you are. Plus, who cares? Yea, there's no\nconsequences to being tied to a controversial white supremacist just a couple\ndays after one of them murdered a woman with his car. It's not like Joe Petty\nand his mindless followers will use that against him. Oh wait….. \"Councilor\nGaffney quotes white supremacist.\" That's the story now. That's how it will be\ntold from this point forward. Buttmunch Billy knew this, which is why he wrote\nit in the first place. But it's not his fault: \"It's not on me the way\npartisans choose to use my reporting.\" See? He was just reporting the facts by\ngoing out of his way to suggest that Gaffney quoted a Nazi. Not his fault how\npeople react to that. Kind of like how people like Billy don't blame Trump\nwhen his supporters do fucked up shit. Many accused him of racebaiting, but\nButtmunch Billy once again disagreed: Yea, totally not race-baiting. White\nsupremacy has nothing do with race. Then things got even juicier: Busted!!!\nApparently Billy was texting Gaffney wanting to know why a post from one of\nhis trolls named Eric Malouin was deleted: Notice the face he forgot to crop\nout after he screenshotted: That would be fellow Worcester Magazine minimum\nwage employee Oh I see now - it was a group effort from Worcester Magazine. No\nwonder Gaffney wanted to spill the bins on their boss - they conspire to make\nhim look bad and they got caught in the act. Nice going Billy. So that means\nLyford was watching this all go down, started screenshotting his boy Eric's\ntroll comments, and then cried about it to Buttmunch Billy when Gaffney\nblocked him. Because Josh was too much of a pussy to confront Gaffney himself.\nSad. It looks as if the local African-American community was not impressed\nwith their race baiting: Boom. Roasted. Once Gaffney threatened to spill the\nbins on Walter's sexting scandal, Billy realized he fucked up. He's only been\non the job a couple months and his childish vendetta was about to lead to the\npublic humiliation of his boss. So he was all like, \"Why not focus on my\nbehavior?\" Because Walter allowed this to happen. What you write reflects upon\nhim. When South Shore Turtlegirl offends large groups of people they go after\nthe brand, not the blogger. We all own it together. It's OK though, because\n\"Worcesteria\" is \"irreverent.\" Yea, it's just a joke Mike!! So I called you a\nwhite supremacist. Big deal snowflake!! His \"friend\" thought it was funny: At\nleast he understands that without doing stuff like this no one would actually\nread his columns: I hate to even give Buttmunch Billy attention he so dearly\ncraves. He writes about us EVERY SINGLE WEEK. Or so I'm told, I don't read it\nmyself. My grandmother calls me about it on her landline. He's baiting for us\nto write about him because he's smart enough to realize that becoming a\nTurtleboy villain will at least make him somewhat relevant. But now he's\nfinally got our attention. Unfortunately for him he was completely exposed for\nbeing the fraud that he is, and his boss might lose his job. We urge you to\nsupport the following local businesses.

            "input": "I have never been prouder to be an American. That might seem like a strange\nconfession in these dark times, when there is so much divisiveness in the\ncountry. Every day we are faced with cringe-worthy behavior by our country's\nleaders: sexual harassment, enabling hate groups by publicly echoing their\nmessages, the enactment of policies that curtail the constitutionally\nguaranteed civil rights of the nonrich. We who love our country are often left\nembarrassed, enraged and exhausted. It's as if some jokester slapped a going\nout of business sign on our country's back and scribbled underneath:\neverything (we stand for) must go. Then why am I so proud of America? Because,\nto paraphrase what Thomas Paine famously said during the Revolutionary War,\nthese are the times that try Americans' souls. It is during tumultuous times\nlike these--times when we are challenged to defend our most sacred beliefs\nwith more than trite slogans on caps--that real heroes rise up to face that\nchallenge. Among these heroes are the athletes who recognize that they have a\nresponsibility not just to defend a goal or a hoop, but also to defend\nAmerican values and ideals. There are certain iconic images that will forever\nlive in our social collective unconscious of activist athletes who risked\ntheir lives, not to mention their careers, to uphold their principles and\ncommitment to their country: Jesse Owens receiving his gold medal in the 1936\nBerlin Olympics while a German runner-up beside him gave the Nazi salute. John\nCarlos and Tommie Smith raising their black-gloved fists when receiving their\nmedals at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics to protest injustice and poverty in\nthe African-American community. In 1996, Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nbowing his head in prayer during the national anthem as a protest against\nracism. In 2014, LeBron James and other NBA players wearing i can't breathe\nshirts to protest Eric Garner's death at the hands of police. These heroes\nremind us what true patriotism is: people caring more about protecting the\nprinciples of the Constitution than about their own careers, fame, money or\neven lives. Colin Kaepernick, the recipient of this year's Sports Illustrated\nMuhammad Ali Legacy Award, is one such hero. What makes Colin so deserving of\nthis award is that he fully embraced all of those risks in order to remind\nAmericans about systemic racism. This is exactly what Muhammad Ali did when,\nat the height of his boxing career, he refused to be drafted during the\nVietnam War. Ali knew that he was not at risk of being sent into combat and\ncould have served as a celebrity soldier. But he insisted on standing up for\nhis principles, even though it cost him millions of dollars and resulted in\ndeath threats, harsh attacks from the press and public, the loss of his title\nand the possibility of prison. Since Colin first declined to stand for the\nnational anthem on Aug. 14, 2016, to call attention to the astounding number\nof unarmed African-Americans killed by police, the citizens have responded\nwith both praise and condemnation, just as they always have whenever anyone\nexercises their right to free speech on a contentious topic. This is the same\ntreatment bold Americans of conscience have always received. People rarely\nwant to hear the truth when that truth reveals problems they don't want to\nface. It's easier to blame the messenger and ignore the message. He is forcing\nthe country to continue to have a meaningful conversation about racial\ninequality when many want to pretend there is no problem. That's why Colin has\nbeen vilified and glorified, ostracized and memorialized, demonized and\nidolized. Though supporters have come and gone, Colin has never wavered in his\ncommitment. This selfless courage has inspired other athletes--from high\nschool to professional ranks--across all sports, races and genders to make\ntheir voices heard. He is forcing the country to continue to have a meaningful\nconversation about racial inequality when many want to pretend there is no\nproblem. Sports Illustrated's Muhammad Ali Legacy Award was created to honor\nindividuals whose career in athletics has directly or indirectly impacted the\nworld. On Nov. 30, it was reported that a group of about 40 NFL players and\nleague officials had reached an agreement for the league to provide\napproximately $90 million between now and 2023 for activism endeavors\nimportant to African-American communities. Clearly, this is the result of\nColin's one-knee revolution and of the many players and coaches he inspired to\njoin him. That is some serious impact. It has always been perplexing that\npeople criticize athletes like Colin as being unpatriotic because they are\nexercising the rights the Constitution protects. It's especially puzzling when\nthey are accused of disrespecting the national anthem, which contains the\nlyrics, \"No refuge could save the hireling and slave/From the terror of\nflight, or the gloom of the grave,\" and was written by a man who referred to\nblacks as an \"inferior race of people.\" When that song is playing, it seems\nlike an especially appropriate time to bring up the fact that 200 years after\nit was written, we are still treating African-Americans as an inferior race by\ndenying them equal opportunities in education, jobs, health care and voting.\nWe praise our military for risking everything to make sure America lives up to\nthe promises in the Constitution: equal opportunity and respect for all\npeople. Upon hearing about the establishment of the award in his honor, Ali\nsaid, \"I know there will be a great tradition of champions to receive this\naward in the future, and I look forward to celebrating their spirit and\naccomplishments.\" Were my old friend still alive, I know he would be proud\nthat Colin Kaepernick is continuing Ali's tradition of being a selfless\nwarrior for social justice. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is a former recipient of the\nSports Illustrated's Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. His new book [Becoming Kareem:\nGrowing Up On and Off the Court](https://goo.gl/xB8n33) details his most\ninfluential mentors, including his lifelong friend, Muhammad Ali.\n\n",

She just\ncan't stop, which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary, get on with\nyour life and give it another try in three years! -- Donald J. Trump\n(@realDonaldTrump) [November 18,\n2017](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/931877599034388480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nI'm sure this is the part where the Clinton-haters -- be they Trumpers, Bernie\nBros or anything in between -- will say something to the effect of, \"Of course\nhe wants her to run again. That's the only way he'll get re-elected!\" Slow\nyour roll there. Clinton's poll numbers aren't too good right now (OK, they're\n[downright](http://www.pollingreport.com/2020.htm)\n[atrocious](http://www.pollingreport.com/hrc.htm)), but there are still four\ngreat reasons to consider choosing her as the Democratic nominee in 2020. Even\nbetter, all but one of them has to do with an emotion that has no place in\nthis season (which is why I absolutely had to write this article for\nThanksgiving weekend): Spite. Delicious, nutritious spite. 1. Hillary Clinton\nis the Winston Churchill to Vladimir Putin's Adolf Hitler. I agree with the\nbasic principle of Godwin's Law: The first person to invoke Hitler in a\npolitical debate should normally lose. The exception, of course, has to be\nwhen someone has genuine Hitler-like qualities. A foreign despot who has\n[invaded neighboring countries](http://www.newsweek.com/putin-preparing-all-\nout-invasion-ukraine-538615) and has a [right-wing nationalist\nagenda](http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-fascist-325534) is about as\nNazi-like as you can get. This is where Clinton offers a quality that no\npolitician in America can beat. While Republicans are trying to tar her with a\n[bogus scandal](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-\npolitics/2017/10/31/16581234/sessions-special-counsel-clinton-uranium-one-\nrussia) connecting her to Russia (and anyone who believes Clinton did\nsomething wrong in the Uranium One deal lacks credibility on all matters\npolitical), the reality is that no candidate can be better described as\nRussia's nemesis than Clinton. Putin has always hated Clinton because of his\ninnate sexism, which has manifested in his\n[policies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-\ncage/wp/2016/11/06/putins-russia-promotes-women-and-misogyny-in-politics-wait-\nwhat/?utm_term=.7b0df1a32abe), and she certainly didn't endear herself to him\nby [publicly criticizing Russian\ncorruption](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153) in\n2011. As the ample connections between the Trump campaign and Russia or its\n[water-carriers](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-\nsecret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/) like\nWikiLeaks clearly demonstrate, the one person we know we can trust more than\nanyone is the candidate who Putin very obviously did not want to see as\nAmerica's president. 2. Hillary Clinton being elected president (at last)\nwould monumentally piss off misogynistic trolls, and what's not to like about\nthat? I can't think of a single political figure in recent American history\nwho has been hated as deeply, or for as long, as Hillary Clinton. From the\nmoment she emerged on the national stage in 1992 as a distinctly feminist\nprospective first lady, she has been the target of right-wing wrath woefully\nout of proportion to anything she has ever said or done. The reason for this\nis sexism. It's not the chic thing to say right now, but no other explanation\nreally makes sense. Yes, Hillary Clinton is more centrist than either party\nlikes these days, but why is she singled out for opprobrium here when her\nhusband -- who actually served as president -- remains\n[popular](http://www.pollingreport.com/clinton1.htm) despite holding the exact\nsame views? The same point can be made about the claim that she is corrupt or\ntoo establishment. To the extent that these accusations are valid, they are no\nmore true of Clinton than of the vast majority of politicians from both\nparties (especially Trump). At the very least, the next Democratic\npresidential candidate needs to be a woman -- perhaps not Clinton\nspecifically, but certainly a woman, to offset the symbolic gut-punch of the\nfirst female candidate getting\n[cheated](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-\ntracker-every-offensive-comment-in-one-place/) by an overt misogynist. And\nspeaking of cheating ... 3. By winning the popular vote convincingly in 2016,\nHillary Clinton has earned the right to be considered the presumptive nominee\nin 2020. As I wrote in September, Clinton is the first defeated presidential\ncandidate to win the popular vote without being automatically considered a\nfrontrunner in the next election. Two of the previous four popular vote-\nwinning also-rans were actually elected in the subsequent cycle (Andrew\nJackson in 1828 and Grover Cleveland in 1892), while two others were widely\nregarded as frontrunners before dropping out for personal reasons (Samuel\nTilden and Al Gore). Let us not forget that, for all of the smack talk about\nhow poorly Clinton ran her campaign, she bested Trump by nearly 3 million\nvotes. This was no razor-thin margin of victory, but a decisive expression of\nthe American public's preference. In terms of percentage points, her margin of\nvictory was roughly comparable to that by which Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford\nin [1976](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/) or George W. Bush beat John\nKerry in [2004](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/). She also held Trump to\na lower percentage of the popular vote than that garnered by Mitt Romney in\n[2012](https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/). 4. We can expect her to be a\ngood president. Frankly, the worst thing that can be said about a potential\n2020 Clinton candidacy, especially in America's current cultural and political\nclimate, is that her husband still hasn't answered for the [numerous sexual\nabuse accusations](https://www.dailydot.com/via/bill-clinton-rape-allegations-\nstill-matter/) against him. While it may seem unfair for Hillary to be held\naccountable for Bill's alleged predations, it can plausibly be argued that she\nplayed a role in helping him cover them up. If that is ever proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt, she should be given the heave-ho. Then again, Bill Clinton\nis also widely associated with the economic, social and foreign policy\nconditions of the beloved 1990s, and is greatly missed for that reason. And\nsince few dispute that Hillary was her husband's co-president during that\nhalcyon decade, that association can still remain a giant advantage. Finally,\nand perhaps most importantly, Clinton demonstrated through the [2016\nDemocratic National Committee\nplatform](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12281022/the-democratic-party-\nplatform) that she would work with progressives on pursuing a policy agenda\nvery close to their own goals. On issues ranging from raising the minimum wage\nand fighting global warming to scaling back the war on drugs, she would stand\nexactly where the majority of grassroots activists in the party want her to\nbe. Plus -- while this has been noted countless times before, it deserves\nrepetition -- she has ample experience as a U.S. senator and secretary of\nstate in actually getting things done. That ability to get things done, by the\nway, is why Clinton had high approval ratings as secretary of state (usually\nin the [60s](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-\nmeter/statements/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-approval-rating-\nsecretary-state-w/)), even proving more popular than President Barack Obama\nand Vice President Joe Biden in 2011 and 2012. Her stock may be low now, but\nit's been low in the past (such as when she \"ran\" to be first lady in 1992),\nand it has always recovered. Arguably the big political question facing a\npotential Hillary 2020 campaign will be whether that bounce occurs at a\nfortuitous moment for her. It very well could, and wouldn't that be a giant\nhelping of the dish [best served\ncold](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Revenge%20is%20a%20dish%20best%20served%20cold)?\nDid You Know? For 20 days, Hillary Clinton was both senator and first lady;\nshe was sworn in as a senator on Jan. 1, 2001, and Bill's last day in the\nWhite House was Jan. 20th. Did You Know? Hillary Clinton is the first First\nLady in American history to be elected into national office, serving as both a\nSenator and as Secretary of State under Obama.\n\n",

True, Trump hasn't actually repealed the deal.\nHe announced new sanctions, [according](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-\ntakes-hard-line-iran-obama-deal-place/story?id=50442196) to ABC News, \"but\ndidn't do anything that would alter the Obama-era deal that he has denounced\nsince his presidential campaign.\" Decertification is Trump to a T: you don't\naccomplish anything, but you manage to create the shittiest possible situation\nregardless. It's a real gift. The deal, Trump said, is no longer in the\nnational security interest of the United States. This decision, which has been\nreferred as \"decertification,\" is a shift in official position. It is a\nsignificant declaration that leaves the nuclear agreement in place, but puts\nCongress in charge of whether or not to follow up with action -- triggering a\n60-day window for lawmakers to re-impose sanctions against Iran that were\nsuspended in 2015 as part of the agreement. Trump decertified the Iran deal\njust 'cause, why not, since you're gutting Obamacare and deciding to let\nPuerto Rico dehydrate; Trump decided to decertify the Iran deal because you're\nwell on your way to becoming the Worst President of Every Timeline, yeah baby,\nand why not light another Roman candle on the fast roller coaster down to\ngeohell? Maybe Congress will rescue the deal, maybe not. The important thing\nis that this takes the best hope we have with Iran and wades back into David\nFrum's \"Let's Invent, and then Invade, the Axis of Evil,\" which gave us the\ntragedy of Iraq. That worked so well, why not repeat it again? The President\nsaid: \"As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the worst and one\nsided transactions the United States has ever entered into\" What does he think\nwe can get instead? The President thinks that Iran has sponsored terrorism\n(and the Saudis haven't) and that the Iranian regime \"has committed multiple\nviolations of the agreement\" (there are mechanisms to deal with these). Trump\ncalled on the intelligence community to look at Iran's help to the North\nKorean nuclear program. Oh! I can help with that one! There's a base right\nsouth of Camp Fantasy, in the northernmost region of the Your Brain is No\nLonger Functioning Mountain Region. The President says Iran loves the chants\n\"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel,\" because the President and his team\nof wannabe-Iranian bombers don't see Iran or its eighty million people--they\nsee whatever Islamophobic, racist-ass caricatures get cooked up on Fox News,\nwhere Khomeini is still somehow alive in the year 2017. Trump decertified the\ndeal, because nothing, not even human life or world peace, is more important\nthan repudiating every bit of Obama's legacy. The major powers and American\nstruck a deal with Iran in July 2015. It eased sanctions and got real\nmonitoring of Iran's nuclear program. Trump's own Defense Secretary said Iran\nhas complied. The agreement got everything we needed from the regime, and now\nTrump wants out, because the movie in his head tells him being the leading\nasshole of the world is definitely, assuredly the best way to go. Trump\ndecertified the Iran deal because he thinks he can get a better one, this man\nwho can't pass a single piece of legislation and can't manage to avoid staring\nat an eclipse. Trump decertified the Iran deal because he doesn't care. Trump\ndecertified the Iran deal because it doesn't matter who the Commander-in-Chief\nis; there is a National Security blob in Washington that no single President\ncan ever fight, and it consumes money and spits out drones and missiles. Trump\nis incompetent in a million unusual ways, but he's particularly, peculiarly\nincompetent in resisting the mechanisms of institutional influence. In other\nwords, Trump will believe whatever the good people of the military-industrial\nconcept whisper in his ear. That community kicked it around, and decided it\nwas best that we threaten Iran again. After all, the NatSec blob has never\nforgotten or forgiven Iran for rejecting Western hegemony--and anyway, none of\ntheir own sons or daughters got shot in Iraq, so yes, why not set the stage\nfor an eventual war with Iran? Trump decertified the deal, and the people of\nthe world were not surprised at all. The man is barely part of reality. What\ndid we expect?\n\n",

Because Obama created it through executive action,\nthere are questions about its legal and constitutional basis. Attorney General\nJeff Sessions announced in September that the program would be phased out for\nthese reasons. \"Any legislation on DACA must secure the border with a wall,\"\nTrump remarked after meeting with Republican senators on the issue. \"It must\ngive our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal\nimmigration and also to stop visa overstays. And, crucially, the legislation\nmust end chain migration. It must end the visa lottery.\" White House press\nsecretary Sarah Sanders described the president as reiterating in the meeting\nwith GOP senators the administration's \"view that any action on DACA must come\nwith action on the president's immigration reform principles, which were\nreleased last year.\" \"These include a physical border wall on the southern\nborder; interior enforcement, which includes more ICE and Border Patrol\nagents; as well as a crackdown on sanctuary cities; and reforms to our legal\nimmigration system, like ending chain migration and the visa lottery program\nin favor of a merit-based immigration system,\" Sanders said at Thursday's\npress briefing. \"Next week, the president is inviting a bipartisan group of\nsenators to the White House to discuss next steps on responsible immigration\nreform and to continue that discussion,\" she added. \"Chain migration\" is a\nphrase used to describe a feature of immigration law that allows immigrants to\nsponsor their relatives to come to the U.S. Family reunification is\nresponsible for more than two-thirds of legal immigration annually, while less\nthan 10 percent come for primarily employment-based reasons. Immigration\nrestrictionist argue this produces a mismatch between immigrant skill levels\nand the U.S. labor force, at the expense of American workers and recent\nimmigrants. A bill introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue,\nR-Ga., endorsed by Trump in August, would cut immigration in half in part by\nlimiting family-based immigrant sponsorship to spouses and minor children.\nThey would like to see something like this provision be part of any DACA deal.\n\"Look, if you give amnesty to one or two million illegal immigrants who were\nbrought here through no fault of their own, as kids, you're going to have at\nleast a couple negative effects,\" Cotton said on Fox News. \"And one of those\nnegative effects is you're going to have a whole new chain of chain migration.\nThe way to control for that negative effect is to stop chain migration.\" The\nimmigration hawks at Numbers USA have launched a [six-figure ad\ncampaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3osFdB6_c1w) to inform the public\nand to help the phrase \"chain migration\" take its place in the political\nlexicon alongside \"amnesty.\" The group's president, Roy Beck, uses the words\ntogether. \"While Congress debates yet another amnesty, we want to help\nAmericans visualize how the presence of chain migration categories means that\namnesties are never limited to the people receiving them but instead open up\nlifetime work permits to millions more of their extended family and in-laws,\"\nBeck said in a statement. Many of the Republicans negotiating with Senate\nDemocrats on a DACA fix favor more expansive immigration policies than Trump.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., for example, was part of the Gang of Eight and is\na co-sponsor of the Democrats' preferred bill for resolving the status of\nDACA. Social conservatives helped beat back a 1990s attempt to reduce\nimmigration in part by limiting chain migration on the grounds that family\nreunification was a pro-family policy. Many immigrant communities and their\nadvocates also oppose the change, arguing that it is already too difficult to\nimmigrate to the U.S. and, this is, itself, a driver of illegal immigration.\nBut Graham suggested Thursday that Trump could succeed where Obama and Bush\nfailed if lawmakers were willing to compromise. \"There's a bill to be had,\" he\nsaid at the White House. \"If you want it bad enough, we'll get it and it will\nbe good for the country. Everybody has got to give a little bit. But I've\nnever been more optimistic about an immigration reform proposal making it to\nthe president's desk right now.\" Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has been a\npersistent critic of Trump on immigration, among other issues, and asked for a\nplace at the table on DACA negotiations when the administration was lobbying\nhim on tax reform. Still, Flake tweeted in December that he could make some\nconcessions the White House wanted, specifically mentioning chain migration.\n\"We can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration\nfor the DREAMers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery,\" he\nwrote. \"If POTUS wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that\npromise.\" Trump has held to these positions even after his split Steve Bannon,\nwho pushed for immigration restrictions when he was working at the White House\nand has published numerous articles on the subject on his media site\nBreitbart. Pressure is building to craft a legislative solution for DACA, as\nbeneficiaries' work permits are starting to expire and there are concerns\nabout how long it would take to ramp up the program again if Congress\nauthorized its revival. \"We must BUILD THE WALL, stop illegal immigration, end\nchain migration [and] cancel the visa lottery,\" Trump tweeted Thursday\nevening. \"The current system is unsafe [and] unfair to the great people of our\ncountry -- time for change!\"\n\n",

The really big\nnews is that former President Barack Hussein Obama's communist and terrorist-\nsupport network remains a state secret. Attorney General Jeff Sessions won't\ntouch it. Until we come to grips with Obama, our first Marxist president with\nradical Muslim sympathies, we are adrift as a nation. He ran for office as a\n[\"committed Christian,\"](https://www.salon.com/2008/01/21/obama_31/) a\nmonumental deception to conceal his record of service to the communist cause,\nMuslim background, and grooming by suspected Soviet espionage agent Frank\nMarshall Davis. As the world marks the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Russian\nrevolution, America should take note of our own communist revolution - the\neight years of the Obama presidency and his leadership of the global anti-\nTrump \"resistance.\" A [WND story](http://www.wnd.com/2017/10/sebastian-gorka-\nidentifies-top-3-threats-to-america/) says former Trump White House aide\nSebastian Gorka believes radical Islamic jihadists, China and radical leftists\npose the greatest threats to U.S. national security, but that \"they will be\ndefeated by President Trump and his supporters who are restoring America's\nglobal dominance and reclaiming the country's culture.\" Based on the record so\nfar, this is as likely as Hollywood coming completely clean about Harvey\nWeinstein's perversities. Russia is not even on the list of Gorka's top three\nthreats! Yet Russia is behind the Jihadists, is in an alliance with Red China,\nand still backs the radical leftists. Gorka tells WND, \"The immediate term\nthreat is the Shia-jihadis - this is Iran, this is the Republican Guard,\nHezbollah. If they get nuclear weapons, that's a game changer and that's why\nit's so important the president decertified the Iran deal.\" Yet, Iran's\nnuclear weapons program is made possible by Russia. Why no mention of that?\nAnd why didn't Trump cancel the Iran deal as he promised to do? In the first\nplace, Obama should have been impeached. Under United Nations auspices, he\nordered the bombing of Libya, in order to depose a ruler, Gadhafi, who had\ngiven up his weapons of mass destruction and was fighting al Qaeda. The\nmassacre of Americans in Benghazi by Jihadists resulted from this illegal and\nunconstitutional war. All of this benefited the Muslim Brotherhood. Indeed,\nObama issued a secret 2011 Presidential Study Directive-11, or PSD-11,\nsupporting this radical Islamist group throughout the Middle East. National\nsecurity reporter Bill Gertz [said](http://freebeacon.com/national-\nsecurity/clinton-backed-egypts-muslim-brotherhood-regime/), \"The directive,\naccording to officials familiar with its contents, outlined how the\nadministration would seek to support the Muslim Brotherhood around the world\ndespite the Islamist supremacist organization providing the ideological\nunderpinning for jihadist terrorism for both al Qaeda and its successor, the\nIslamic State.\" PSD-11, which is still secret, should be released by the Trump\nAdministration and declared exhibit number one in a criminal investigation of\nBarack Hussein Obama. Trump was supposed to turn things around. In\nAfghanistan, Gorka tells WND that Trump's speech sending more American\nsoldiers to their deaths in an endless conflict didn't use the words \"radical\nIslamic terrorism.\" He was upset about that omission. But Trump also [didn't\nmention](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/21/remarks-\npresident-trump-strategy-afghanistan-and-south-asia) Russia's role in [sending\narms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/04/24/russia-is-\nsending-weapons-to-taliban-top-u-s-general-confirms/?utm_term=.1d5628456887)\nto a Taliban faction killing our troops. This is what we called the [Red\nJihad](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Jihad-Moscows-Solution-\nAmerica/dp/1523956097), a book quoting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu as saying that Soviet/Russian support for international terrorism\nmade radical Islam into the threat it is today. He explains that, \"without the\nsupport offered by the Soviet bloc and the Arab world, international terrorism\nwould revert to its earlier, localized manifestations before the 1960s and\nwould hardly dominate the global scene.\" If you want to defeat radical Islam,\nengineer regime change in Russia, which is still the global center of\nrevolutionary violence against America. Domestically, Sebastian Gorka mentions\nin the WND interview the influence of Obama associates Bill Ayers and\nBernardine Dohrn in academia, but ignores how their communist terrorist\nnetworks spawned the Obama candidacy and presidency. These networks, nurtured\neven today by Bill Ayers in his new book, Demand the Impossible: A Radical\nManifesto, are promising an uprising of some sort on November 4. The [Refuse\nFascism](https://refusefascism.org/2017/07/24/why-we-have-taken-up-the-fight-\nto-build-refuse-fascism-and-to-drive-out-the-trumppence-fascist-regime/)\ngroup, which is behind the November 4 protests, is a front of the\nRevolutionary Communist Party and its founder, former Ayers and Dohrn\nassociate Bob Avakian. As we document in [Comrade Obama\nUnmasked](https://www.amazon.com/Comrade-Obama-Unmasked-Marxist-\nWhite/dp/1548403008), Obama supported America's enemies at every opportunity,\nincluding the communist regime in Cuba, the communists running South Africa,\nand even the FARC narco-terrorists in Colombia. But he stands out during his\neight years in office as the real Russian agent, who was passive when Russia\ninvaded Ukraine and Syria, gave Russia a nuclear weapons advantage over the\nU.S., and awarded the Russians special trading privileges. Working with\nRussia, he conceived the Iran nuclear deal. However, on his way out the door,\nin a classic Marxist dialectical maneuver, his CIA director John Brennan\nlaunched an investigation of President Trump as a Russia agent. It was a\nstroke of genius that put Trump on the defensive, gave the liberal news media\nmonths of joy, and resulted in multiple Russia-gate investigations, including\nby a former FBI director determined to get Trump. On the 100th anniversary of\nthe Virgin Mary Fatima revelations about Russia's threat to world peace, we\nalso learn from Dr. Paul Kengor's new book that the Soviets were behind the\nMay 13, 1981, attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. The book, A Pope\nand a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold\nStory of the 20th Century, says Reagan's CIA director Bill Casey confirmed the\nSoviet role, in the face of official CIA resistance to the finding. Until the\nreality of Obama's communist support is examined and the secret role of Russia\nin global conflict exposed, the former president and America's enemies will\nhave the upper hand. But Gorka and Trump seem clueless. \"China has the most\nleverage to deal with North Korea,\" Gorka told WND. \"And the fact that the\npresident and Ambassador Haley at the U.N. have managed to convince China that\neven if you're in a competition with us, you will not profit by having a\nnuclear war on your border and they joined us with Russia - it's a big deal -\nin the tightest sanctions package against North Korea in history, that tells\nyou how big a problem North Korea is. China may be our long term enemy, but\nthey don't a war in their back doorstep either.\" Does he really think another\nin an endless series of U.N. resolutions will make any difference? The U.N. is\nanother communist front, designed by a Russian agent working in our State\nDepartment by the name of Alger Hiss. Have we forgotten? Working through the\nU.N. is a dangerous dead end. Our book [The Sword of\nRevolution](https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Revolution-Communist-\nApocalypse/dp/1515257606) conclusively demonstrates that the \"Sino-Soviet\nsplit\" was a fraud. What's more, the \"collapse\" of Red Russia was itself a\nfraud, too. Together, China and Russia, combined with Obama's inaction during\nhis two terms, have made a nuclear North Korea a reality. What's more, China\nis still communist. An article in China Daily, entitled, [\"Adapting Marxism\ncalled\ncrucial,\"](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-09/30/content_32668217.htm)\nexplains how Marxism is guiding the country's future. Here's a quote:\nPresident Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China\n[CPC] Central Committee… said that as a party upholding Marxism, the CPC\nshould make sure its theories keep up with the times. Drifting away from or\nbetraying Marxism will lead to the Party's losing its soul and direction as it\nmoves forward, Xi added. Marxism is unsurpassed in achieving great heights and\nhaving a huge influence, he said. The reliance on China to deal with its\nnuclear client, North Korea, is another dead end. The key failure involves the\ninability or unwillingness to investigate Obama's global network and what his\nanti-American policies were designed to do. In terms of the threat within,\nconsider that the FBI website still features wanted posters of two fugitives:\n[Donna Borup](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/donna-joan-borup) and [Elizabeth\nAnna Duke](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/elizabeth-anna-duke), both members of\nthe May 19th Communist Organization. Filmmaker Joel Gilbert, a speaker at our\nupcoming [November 10 National conference on\nObamunism](http://americasurvival.org/2017/08/the-real-russia-gate-conspiracy-\nof-barack-hussein-obama.html#axzz4vbzbnC9e), has [cited\nevidence](http://www.obamasrealfather.com/directors-q-and-a/page2.php) that\nObama was a member or supporter of the May 19th Communist Organization, an\nabove ground support group for the Weather Underground based in New York City\nfrom 1978-1985. He notes that the May 19 Communist Organization was described\nby Obama pal and former communist terrorist Bill Ayers as providing \"a sea for\nthe guerillas to swim in.\" Some May 19 members committed acts of violence and\nterrorism, such as the 1981 Nanuet Brinks robbery and murders, the bombing of\nSouth African offices in 1981, and the U.S. Capital bombing in 1983, notes\nGilbert. He adds, \"I spoke with a former FBI informant who told me the May\n19th Communist Organization had a weapons training camp in the Catskill\nMountains, run by former Black Panthers. In addition, some May 19 members were\nsent to Cuba for several weeks each year with the Venceremos Brigades, a\ncontinuation of the SDS/Weather Underground program begun in the sixties, for\nexplosives training from Cuban intelligence, DGI.\" Here's the big revelation:\n\"A former May 19 member I spoke with identified Obama as participating in\ntheir public protests and meetings. In his 'Dreams' book, Obama mentions\ntransferring to Columbia to pursue his interest in activism and recounts\nattendance at some events similar to those sponsored by May 19.\" This might\nhelp explain why Borup and Duke are still on the loose. And why Obama never\ndemanded the extradition of Black Liberation Army cop-killer [Assata\nShakur](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/joanne-deborah-chesimard)\nand FALN bomb-maker [William Morales](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/william-\nguillermo-morales) from Cuba. In addition to the focus on Obama, our November\n10 conference will expose the Red Pope, Francis, who was Obama's collaborator\nafter a George Soros-engineered coup forced Pope Benedict to resign. The old\njoke, \"Is the Pope Catholic?,\" is not funny anymore. This pope is not\nCatholic; he's a communist. *Cliff Kincaid has written two books on Obama, two\non the United Nations, and many on media bias.

Thank\nYOU!\n********************************************************************************\nEarlier this week, CNN published a story titled \" [White supremacists by\ndefault': How ordinary people made Charlottesville\npossible](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/ordinary-white-\nsupremacists/index.html),\" which basically said that every single person that\nvoted for Donald Trump to be president was a White Supremacist by Default.\nJohn Blake, CNN Enterprise writer/producer, is the article's author. Blake\nblamed Trump voters for helping to advance white supremacy. How, you may ask?\nBecause even the ordinary, non-racist Trump supporter was giving space for\nwhite supremacists to operate and are ultimately the reason for what took\nplace in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"It's easy to focus on the angry white men\nin paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in\nthe Virginia college town,\" Blake wrote. \"But it's the ordinary people -- the\nvoters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially\ninsensitive comments, the people who move out of the neighborhood when people\nof color move in, the family members who ignore a relative's anti-Semitism --\nwho give these type of men room to operate.\" Now, Blake is a Black man. Given\nthe fact he is writing at CNN, would it be safe to assume he supported Barack\nHussein Obama Soetoro Soebarkah? If so, would it also, given the fact of his\nwarped logic here, be fair to use his logic against him and say that he is\nresponsible for the violence of the knockout game, Black Lives Matter and the\nadvancement of Black Power movements like the New Black Panthers and Louis\nFarrakhan's Nation of Islam? Bathroom Issues? Do This Once A Day Yeah, it\nmakes a point, but it wouldn't be fair to say, would it? Blake was not alone\nin putting this piece together. He cited Mark Naison, a political activist and\nhistory professor at Fordham University in New York City, who compared Trump\nsupporters to the \"nice people\" in Nazi Germany and Rwanda. \"That was the\ntwisted formula that made the Holocaust and Rwanda possible and allowed Jim\nCrow segregation to survive: Nice people looked the other way while those with\nan appetite for violence did the dirty work,\" Naison said. \"You have to have\nmillions of people who are willing to be bystanders, who push aside evidence\nof racism, Islamophobia or sexism. You can't have one without the other.\"\nBlake then went on to say that there are four groups of people who play a part\nin racial divisions in the country, based on Ms. Naison and others. \"Many of\nthe white racists who marched in Charlottesville were condemned because they\nopenly said they don't believe in integration or racial equality,\" Blake wrote\nabout Trump supporters. \"But millions of ordinary white Americans have been\nsending that message to black and brown people for at least a half a century.\nThey send it with their actions: They don't want to live next to or send their\nchildren to school with black or brown people, historians say.\" Then there are\nthose who thought Trump's comments about both sides having issues when it\ncomes to racial hatred. \"Trump's 'many sides' response, though, wasn't that\nabnormal in the context of US history,\" wrote Blake. \"It used to be the norm\nfor white political leaders to draw a moral equivalence between racists and\nthose who suffered from their acts of brutality, historians say. It's the\n\"yes, but\" rhetorical maneuver -- condemn racism but add a qualifier to\ndiminish the sincerity of what you just said.\" Trump's comments were spot on\nfor anyone paying attention. Obama had stirred up racial tensions in America\nto the point that even Black people were saying he was doing it. Then Blake\ndecided to list a third group. This group is those who \"choose chaos.\" \"Many\nvoters knew Trump would bring something else to the Oval Office -- chaos,\"\nBlake wrote. \"That's why they chose him. He's their first reality TV\npresident, one writer says.\" \"Many voted for Trump because they liked the\npersona he cultivated as the star of 'The Apprentice,'\" he continued. \"Reality\nTV rewards characters who say rude and reprehensible things, characters are\noften cast as racial stereotypes, and those who provoke the most chaos get the\nmost attention, says Joy Lanzendorfer, author of the Vice article, ['How\nReality TV Made Donald Trump\nPresident.'\"](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avak5a/how-reality-tv-made-\ndonald-trump-president) Again, he never mentions the chaos we saw across the\ncountry that was sparked by the Black Lives Matter crowds. To do that would\ndemonstrate the hypocrisy of his article. Finally, there are those that Blake\nsays \"look the other way.\" \"If you want to know why those white racists now\nfeel so emboldened, it may help to look at all the ordinary people around you,\nyour neighbors, your family members, your leaders,\" Blake wrote. \"But first,\nstart by looking at yourself.\" Well, turn about is fair play. Perhaps, Mr.\nBlake should look in the mirror and then take a look at the lying,\nmanipulative and deceitful propaganda outlet he is working for, then maybe, he\nmight get a clue at just how badly he has been indoctrinated before he points\nthe finger at people who have light skin and labels them all racist because of\nsome delusional logic that he possesses. Mr. Blake might also wonder how he is\nemboldening the racism of those in his own community.

Instead\nof looking in the mirror and considering her ill-advised statements about the\ncause of terrorism and a deserter's supposedly meritorious record, this time\nshe blames the backlash on the intersection of race and gender. In short, she\nclaims she is being attacked [because she is a black\nwoman](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/28/susan-rice-suggests-race-\ngender-bias-linked-to-unmasking-backlash.html). In reality, she is being\nattacked because she is a ridiculous partisan hack, whose disconnect from\nbasic facts and ability to repeat the most ridiculous spin and talking points\nfrom the Obama administration is as ridiculous as it is stunning. If we\nmeasured political ability by a person's capacity to say laughable talking\npoints with a straight face, Susan Rice has to be the politician of the\ncentury. She first made the news when she commented on the 2012 attacks in\nLibya that killed the US ambassador and 3 other Americans. Hillary Clinton's\nState Department emails (the ones that weren't illegally deleted of course),\nrevealed that she told multiple people almost immediately that the events in\nLibya were terrorist attacks. But in public, Susan Rice went on five Sunday\ntalk shows to claim they attacked in [response to a\nvideo](https://youtu.be/Cetu6SMiZsY) even though it was plainly obvious to\nanybody watching that there was more to the attack than a video. The next time\nshe resurfaced she tried to defend Bowe Bergdahl, an army soldier captured by\nthe Taliban. When the Obama administration secured his release Susan Rice\nagain went on morning talk shows. This time she said he served with \" [honor\nand distinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdGe0uP7W-c).\" But this was\ncompletely outrageous because most of his comrades said he defected to the\nenemy and the army court martialed him for desertion. The trade also sparked a\nsignificant debate over the wisdom in trading one (subpar) soldier for five\nterrorists. Now she has resurfaced again. Her name has entered the\nconversation in regards to the so-called Russian hacking of the election.\nAmong all of the arguing, Susan Rice admitted to being one of the individuals\nthat unmasked figures in the Trump campaign. Unlike the hysteria over little\nmore than innuendo linking the Trump campaign with Russia, unmasking can be a\nserious crime. As a result she has been the subject of intense disagreement\nand scrutiny.

Mueller III and his agents, desperate men flipped and singing to\nsave their souls -- all may soon be gone, by President Trump's design. If\nthere's any outrage left in the tank, use it now, because Trump has signaled\nexactly what he's going to do. First, he had to set some brush fires,\nimpugning the legitimacy of the rule of law -- an old dictator's trick. Trump\nis no Hitler, but when the German Reichstag burned in 1933, it was all the\nNazis needed to gut civil liberties. So, before Trump can fire the prosecutor\nwho is hot on the corruption trail of those in the president's inner circle,\nhe needs a pretext. He could just work his way down the line at the Justice\nDepartment, until he found a quisling willing to remove the special counsel.\nBut before he gets to that, he has to delegitimize the whole investigation.\nThus, he's now attacking the F.B.I., saying the agency is in \"Tatters\" and its\nstanding \"the worst in History.\" Bashing cops -- wasn't that what those Black\nLives Matter people did to disrespect Blue Lives? Thank God we have Sarah\nHuckabee Sanders as a moral clarion in a crisis. \"When you're attacking F.B.I.\nagents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing,\" she\ntweeted. Sorry -- that was Sarah Huckabee Sanders of a year ago, before she\nwas paid to defend the liar in chief. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, has been busy\nclearing out more brush, making the preposterous claim that the president\ncannot obstruct justice because he's the nation's chief law enforcement\nofficer. If Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue -- his own suggested redline\n-- he could, as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, tell the cops to\nquash the investigation. See, when the president does it, it's not a crime.\nThis defense was floated during the two impeachment episodes of the 20th\ncentury. The third time will not be a charm. But Trump's team already has gone\nfrom there is no collusion or obstruction to, so what? If it happened, it's no\nbiggie. They don't appear to be the least bit troubled by a stunning report\nfrom a whistle-blower. As Trump was pledging to put America first during his\nInaugural Address, his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was [texting\na former business\nassociate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/politics/michael-flynn-\nrussia-sanctions-ripped-up-\nwhistleblower.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-) serving\nforeign clients. With Trump in, the sanctions against Russia would be \"ripped\nup,\" clearing the way for big money to be made on the inside, according to the\nreport made public Wednesday. Ignoring that story, Trump's media wing is doing\nits job. Sean Hannity, at state-run television, went on a vein-popping rant\nTuesday against law enforcement, complete with conspiracy charts. He called\nthe federal authorities \"a team of so-called investigators.\" As for their\nboss, he said that \"Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice\nsystem and has put the country on the brink of becoming a banana republic.\"\nHe's certainly learned the art of projection from his master. The Wall Street\nJournal, channeling its owner and Trump whisperer Rupert Murdoch, has been\nmaking much of the same case, albeit without the spittle. Don't forget, this\nis the same Robert Mueller who won wide bipartisan praise when he was\nappointed special counsel: a career prosecutor, the longest-serving director\nof the F.B.I. since J. Edgar Hoover, awarded the Bronze Star for his service\nas a Marine in Vietnam. Republicans love him. Or they did until he started\nclosing in on Trump's closest associates. Mueller should be fired, the Russian\nenablers now claim, because one of his agents said some bad things about\nTrump. This agent, Peter Strzok, was reassigned over the summer, as soon as\nhis comments came to light. Wow, a G-man has opinions. The cops I know, a\ncouple of longstanding friends, have more opinions than I. The facts are what\nmatter. And the facts are pointing in a very bad direction for the gang that\ncan't collude straight. Trump has got to be sweating it; he was said to be\n\"seething\" when two of his campaign aides were indicted and a third pleaded\nguilty in October. He looked punch-drunk at recent public events. Now that\nhe's a felon from a guilty plea last week, Flynn is cooperating with Mueller.\nHe knows plenty. Trump could pardon him and try to bring him back into the\nfold. The outrage would be minimal among the Banana Republicans. Sure, they\ngot their tax-relief-for-the-rich bill passed, so they may no longer need\nTrump after he signs it. But now they're dreaming of more -- cutting Medicare\nand health care for children, so they have a reason to keep him around. If\nTrump fires Mueller, he can start the new year clean. His base will stick with\nhim. Though voters believe, by a nearly 2-1 margin, that Russians interfered\nwith the United States election, [Republicans do\nnot](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2504). Party before\ncountry -- in the face of a dangerous turn toward authoritarianism, that's all\nthat matters.\n\n",

Raymond Dehn\n[revealed](http://www.fox9.com/news/270151845-story) the radical approach to\npublic safety he'll be taking should he be elected mayor in an interview with\nFox 9 Minneapolis less than two weeks following the death of an Australian\nnational by the name of Justine Damond. Damond, of course, was the woman shot\nand killed by Officer Mohamed Noor on July 15 while attempting to report the\nsound of a woman screaming behind her house. No one will ever know for sure\nwhether it was the fireworks taking place in the area that night or if it was\nthe alleged \"slapping\" of the patrol car by the victim just before the\nshooting that caused it. The only absolute in this tragic situation is that\nJustine Damond--a woman who called the police for help--is dead from a bullet\nshot from an officer's gun. As is the case with every high-profile (Officer\nInvolved Shooting) OIS, the equation cannot be balanced by departmental\nexplanations that offer no objective truth in the minds of the masses. People\nare angry. They don't want explanations. They want action. Dehn, of course,\nknows this and is attempting to capitalize on it at the polls by painting\npolice with a broad brush as incompetent and unnecessarily armed. Don't miss\nthe fact that the District 59B representative only wants MPD officers to be\nrestricted from carrying firearms on their hips. If he had it his way, he'd\nstill allow them to keep guns in their vehicles. Therefore, his \"solution\"\ndoesn't even attempt to prevent the Justine Damond death from occurring. It's\nan empty proposal made at an opportune time. There's a reason the Justine\nDamond story has become an international story. It is a statistical anomaly.\nAccording to the [Washington Post OIS\nDatabase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-\nshootings-2017/), of the 574 civilians killed in officer-involved shootings so\nfar this year, Damond is one of five unarmed women.

All four\nvehicles were used as deadly weapons by their drivers as they rammed police in\nattempts to get away. Woods, on the other hand, was used as a human shield by\nher boyfriend during a SWAT raid targeting him and his father for multiple\nshootings. While these four women were killed during deadly force encounters\nin which they were accessories to crimes committed by boyfriends, Damond's\ncase is entirely unique. The trend continues if we go back a few years. In\n2016, three unarmed women were killed by police. [Jessica\nWilliams](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Veteran-SFPD-Officer-Who-\nFatally-Shot-Woman-Feared-for-Partners-Safety-Sources-380334691.html) was shot\nin San Francisco after nearly trapping one officer between a fence and the\nstolen vehicle she was attempting to flee in.

Two rounds hit Steele instead. Each of the eleven\nofficer-involved shootings involving \"unarmed\" females in the past three years\nis tragic--but the trend shows that seven of them were killed while engaging\nin criminal activity with boyfriends with a penchant for violence. Bettie\nJones, Ciara Meyer, and Autumn Steel were killed as bystanders in legitimate\ndeadly force encounters where officers feared for their lives. That leaves\nJustine Damond in a class of her own. Like I said, her death is the anomaly of\nall anomalies. Politicians like Raymond Dehn are free to use their own\n[history of criminality](http://www.startribune.com/both-parties-unite-to-\ngive-ex-felons-a-second-chance/214555101/) to bolster their political profile\nin a society that loves a comeback story. Being a recovering cocaine addict\nand felon doesn't preclude anyone from running for mayor, but when a\npolitician takes advantage of tragedies such as Justine Damond's death to\nsuggest that police officers should place themselves in imminent danger…well,\nthat's where the line needs to be drawn. Despite advances in proficiency for\nfirearms training over the course of several decades, 27 police officers have\nalready been murdered by gunfire in the line of duty this year. In 2015, the\ntotal was 47. In 2016, it was 63. According to the [Officer Down Memorial\nPage](https://www.odmp.org/), we are currently on track to lose around the\nsame number to gunfire this year. Hopefully, we'll buck the trend. Every\nofficer will tell you that there is a wide spectrum of skill levels as it\nrelates to weapons tactics, handling, and marksmanship. What we'll also all\ntell you is that the level of skill a cop possesses matters little if someone\nis hellbent on killing them. An easy response for anyone telling you Dehn is\nonto something is to tell them that many of the gunfire-related deaths\nAmerican police get hit with each year are ambushes. The most self-confident\nman or woman knows that it doesn't take much skill to walk up behind them,\npoint a gun to the back of their head, and pull the trigger. Our guns--readily\naccessible at our hips--are of little use in defending an attack from a gunman\nwho's got the jump on us. Just last week, [Lieutenant Aaron\nAllan](https://www.odmp.org/officer/23334-lieutenant-aaron-allan) was shot 14\ntimes by the occupant of a rolled-over vehicle on an Indiana roadway. One\nminute the LT is trying to help people involved in a car accident, and the\nnext he's getting shot dead by one of them. Earlier this month, New York State\n[Trooper Joel Davis](https://www.odmp.org/officer/23313-trooper-joel-r-davis)\nwas shot while exiting his vehicle upon arrival at a domestic disturbance.\nLike Lt. Allen, he hadn't even gotten the chance to get out of his holster.\nFour days prior to that, there was Detective Miosotis Familia, who was shot\none time in the back of the head in the Bronx while writing in her note pad.\nPolicing in America has become less and less desirable over the years, and the\ndecline in numbers of police patrolling the streets shows it. The city with a\nmajor staff shortage will tell you the reason is \"a stronger economy\" creating\nmore competition for prospective employees. The cop-hating fringe of the\npublic will tell you, \"Good. We don't need them.\" The local police union will\ntell you that it's because of low pay, dissolving of pensions, lawsuits, etc.\nThe police officer will tell you it's because the risk is no longer worth it.\nMany officers feel like this job is punishing whether we do our jobs or we\ndon't. We're trained to carry guns to save the lives of others and our own. If\nwe don't use deadly force when we should, we're screwed. If we do use it when\nwe should, we're still screwed. Every now and then, we use it when we're not\nsupposed to--and that gets twisted to look like it's the national norm. To\npretend that police officers anywhere in America can do the job we do without\naccess to a firearm by our side is to be willfully ignorant of the dangers we\nface daily in a society armed to the teeth with guns. We are not Great\nBritain, Ireland, or France. People don't use machetes to hack at us, or\nvehicles to run us over. They come at us with guns--and we require our own to\nstand a chance. Whether it be Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, San Francisco,\nor Berkeley, mark my words, the progressive metropolis that turns officers\ninto guinea pigs for this social experiment will find itself without a test\nsubject--and without a police force.\n\n",

Police\narrived on Baldwin Hill Road in the small Berkshire County town of Egremont\naround 4:15 p.m. to find the late woman's father allegedly choking and\nstriking a struggling man while his son helped hold down his arms. Both father\nand son were \"screaming different versions of 'you killed my [expletive]\ndaughter' and 'you killed my [expletive] sister,'\" according to a report by\nEgremont Police Officer Hans Carlson, obtained Friday by MassLive. The man was\nable to escape the slow-moving van on Baldwin Hill Road, whereupon both\nLombardis allegedly followed him out and continued the attack, which residents\nof the street observed and reported to police, who intervened in a quick\nresponse. I don't normally condone vigilantism, but at the same time, we're\nliving in a state filled to the brim with Deval Patrick judges that let\nscumbags out onto the street time and time again. Some times you just gotta do\nwhat you gotta do. Nah mean? Big shoutout to this father and son duo who\nrealized that this was the only way they were going to receive any sort of\nsatisfaction. There's no way the idiot they kidnapped ever saw it coming\neither. There's a reason it was just the son that was supposed to show up. The\nDad looks like he done killed 4-5 people before. Plus his name is Ralph. I\ndon't fuck with guys named Ralph who wear shirts like that. That's just common\nsense. Meanwhile the son appears to be your average Berkshire hippie jock who\nis no stranger to craft beer festivals: Never in a million years did the\n\"victim\" think that guy right there was gonna kidnap him in a van and\nwaterboard him to kingdom come until he named names. I've said it before and\nI'll say it again - there is no one more gutless than a heroin dealer. Pot\ndealers are great, and coke dealers I don't have strong opinions on. Know why?\nBecause they do their own product. Heroin dealers don't. Because they'd be\ndead pretty quickly. If you can't stand by your product then you're a piece of\nshit. People who sell heroin are choad monkeys because they KNOW they're\nprofiting off of the self-destruction of another person. There has never,\never, ever been a positive affect of heroin. Ever. You are selling poison to\nstupid and vulnerable people who don't know any better. You are the lowest of\nthe low. Granted the guy they kicked the shit out of wasn't the actual dealer.\nBut he knew who the dealer was and it was time to name names. This is the only\nway to get that information. Big props for doing it mafia style too by using a\nvan, and telling the idiot they picked up that they were gonna magically fix\nhis debt problems. The only surprising part about this story is that they got\ncaught in Egremont. Egremont is easily top 5 places to dump a body in\nMassachusetts. Ever been there before? It's a real trip. Nestled next to\nAlford, Mount Washington (there's a town called Mount Washington), New York\nstate, and the metropolis of Great Barrington, there's no reason for anyone to\never go to Egremont. Ever. The fact that this nudnik jumped out of the van and\npeople were actually there to see it is nothing less than a statistical\nmiracle. I don't wanna say that father and son are heroes, but they kind of\njust revolutionized the opiate epidemic. If you sell heroin, you no longer get\na free pass from some SJW judge. You get old school punishment from the\nfamily. At least that might present a detriment for potential dealers down the\nroad. We urge you to support the following local businesses.

The\ncase now advances to the trial phase. A panel will convene, likely sometime in\nthe spring, to determine if Marshall has engaged in misconduct. Punishment for\nethics violations range from a public reprimand to a suspension or disbarment.\nThe disciplinary board identified two rules Marshall may have violated, one\ninvolving criminal conduct that reflects poorly on a lawyer's honesty and\ntrustworthiness or fitness and the other dealing with conduct involving fraud\nand dishonesty. Marshall's lawyer, Allison Martin Rhodes, said Monday that\nMarshall \"has always acknowledged\" that she \"was not completely truthful\" when\nasked by a superior about the relationship. Martin Rhodes has said Marshall\nlied when asked if she had sex with her subordinate but was subsequently\nforthcoming in a four-hour interview with authorities. The professional\nstandards agency opened an investigation last year after the U.S. Department\nof Justice's inspector general found Marshall had engaged in a yearlong\n\"intimate and personal\" relationship with a subordinate. The inspector general\nsaid Marshall, who now practices law in McMinnville, violated sexual\nharassment laws, lied to investigators and tried to block the investigation.\nThe Inspector General's Office in March 2015 opened an investigation of\nMarshall.

Wolff writes that after the white\nsupremacist mayhem in Charlottesville, Va., Trump privately rationalized \"why\nsomeone would be a member of the K.K.K.\" Many believe the anecdotes and quotes\nfrom Wolff's book should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism, but\nthis one is not implausible. Trump went on the record in the wake of the\nCharlottesville white supremacy march that left Heather Heyer dead, saying he\nbelieved there were \" good people\" on both sides of the protest, one side of\nwhich was rife with Neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Trump was widely\ncriticized for the response, which many considered a tacit endorsement of\nwhite supremacy.

But there was one dark\ncloud over the evening: the surprise, supposedly comedic appearance by\ndisgraced former press secretary Sean Spicer. Judging by the Sean Spicer Emmy\nreactions on Twitter, viewers were not pleased to see this angry little man\njoking around with his pal Stephen Colbert on their television screen. Maybe\nit's a good thing the 2017 Emmys got this questionable political stunt out of\nthe way early. The Former White House Press Secretary to President Trump was\nbrought out on stage by host Stephen Colbert at the end of his opening\nmonologue.

The reaction on Twitter to Sean\nSpicer's Emmy appearance was overwhelmingly negative -- from both regular\nviewers and celebrity viewers. Former SNL player and actress Jenny Slate\ntweeted that she was \"so grossed out\" by the decision. She said, Truly so\ngrossed out by A GROUP of people ever even considering the idea of real life\nSpicer at the Emmys. What is wrong with you? Wake up. Similarly, actor Zach\nBraff tweeted, I'm not ready to laugh \"with\" Sean Spicer. I think he is an\nevil, opportunistic liar that hurt our country. Filmmaker and actor Rob\nReiner, known for his role as Max Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street, tweeted,\nDT is a sick liar. If we reward Sean Spicer for enabling his sickness, we are\nsaying we accept a mentally ill POTUS. And of course, though she didn't share\nher opinion on Twitter, Melissa McCarthy's reaction when the camera cut to her\nduring the real Spicer's bit said a thousand words: She did not approve. Many\nnon-celebrities also shared their disapproval on Twitter, some viewer\nlamenting the double standard for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\nand this small angry liar. Others critiqued the Television Academy for its\nhypocrisy. Again, though the night was filled anti-Trump sentiment, inspiring\nspeeches about political activism, and supposedly subversive post-Trump\ntelevision, Spicer was still invited onto that very same stage where that all\ntook place. And according to journalist Chris Gardner of The Hollywood\nReporter, who attended the show, Spicer had no lack of fans and attention\nafter the Emmys. Gardner tweeted, What pariah? Sean Spicer getting mobbed in\n#Emmys lobby. Posing for pics, drinking beer, soaking up all attention after\nonstage appearance. Don't you just love it when lying politicians -- who are\nso terrible at their job even Donald Trump has to fire them -- become beloved,\nwhacky celebrities? Thanks for that one, Academy of Television Arts &amp;\nSciences.\n\n",

Ted Cruz, Charles Grassley and John McCain have all sent\nsuch signals, as have some other prominent conservatives. It's worth taking\nthis talk seriously. Too many top Republicans have made clear in recent years\nthat they care more about winning than about adhering to political norms or\ndoing what's best for the country. You can see this attitude in the\nwillingness to shut down the government, the threats to default on the\nnational debt and the stated desire to make Obama a failed president. The\npolitical scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein call it \" [asymmetric\npolarization](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/yes-\npolarization-is-asymmetric-and-conservatives-are-worse/373044/)\": the two\npolitical parties have come to behave quite differently. Refusing to seat a\nninth justice, simply for ideological reasons, would be a clear and worrisome\nbreak with democratic tradition. It would send the message that Republicans\nbelieve a president should be able to exercise the Constitutional power to\nname justices only if that president were Republican. It would represent a new\nlevel of partisan cynicism. I hope that the wiser heads within the Republican\nParty prevail after the election. But Democrats should be prepared for the\nalternative. The alternative would mean that Senate control -- which remains\n[up in the air](http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-congress-senate), given\nthe tightness of recent polls -- will be crucial. If Republicans hold the\nSenate, a President Hillary Clinton would be at their mercy with any nominee.\nIf Democrats take the Senate, they would have an obvious fallback plan:\neliminating the 60-vote threshold of the filibuster -- as a Senate majority\ncan always do -- and confirming a justice with 51 votes. As long as\nRepublicans keep talking about permanent obstructionism, Democrats should not\nhesitate to use that option. What I'm reading: Jeff Shesol, at The New Yorker,\nhas [an excellent breakdown](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-\nrepublicans-fight-to-shrink-the-supreme-court) of the growing signs of the\nRepublicans' Supreme Court obstructionism.\n\n",

During Friday morning's broadcast of the SiriusXM Patriot station's\n\"Breitbart News Daily\" program, host and editor-in-chief Alex Marlow stated in\nno uncertain terms that Moore was a \"horrible,\" \"terrible\" candidate, though\nthe media property's allegiance to Trump left him with \"no option\" but to\ndefend his positions and his alleged behavior. Multiple women have alleged\nthat both the president and Moore either harassed or assaulted them in their\nyears before taking elected office. \"There was no option to throw Judge [Roy]\nMoore under the bus,\" said Marlow. \"If you set the standard that Roy Moore,\nwho was accused of abusing five women . . . If you make that the standard, the\nleft is going to use it to take out President Trump.\" Marlow continued to cast\ndoubt on the credibility of Moore's accusers, but reinforced the notion that,\nat the end of the day, his publication's support of the Alabama candidate was\nnot about the contender himself. \"There was never any reason to cave unless\nyou have a . . . unless you would like President Trump to get removed from\noffice,\" he continued. \"And if not even removed from office, at least have\nmassive distractions from his agenda so that we never accomplish anything for\nthe remainder of the president's term.\" Marlow added that \"much of the\nRepublican Party\" would like to see the president's leadership derailed on\nthose terms. \"Much of the Republican Party does not see that as a negative,\"\nhe said. He continued his critique of Moore. \"When you've got a race when\nyou've got a horrible candidate. Let's not -- you guys are being too polite\nabout Roy Moore -- he was a terrible candidate,\" he said. \"His message did not\nresonate, he had all the baggage, he had the scandal. When he'd run for\nstatewide office he'd only won in very tight races or relatively tight,\nconsidering he's the Republican. Roy Moore was not a good candidate at all.\"\nThroughout the contentious 2017 Alabama special election to replace Jeff\nSessions, whom Trump nominated for Attorney General shortly after he won the\npresidency, Breitbart was one of Moore's more active, vociferous defenders.\nWorking hard to deny the many claims of sexual misconduct against him, forward\nthe candidate's bizarre, often unconstitutional positions and cast aspersions\non his opponents -- first GOP primary candidate Luther Strange and then\nDemocratic contender and eventual victor Doug Jones -- Breitbart became a sort\nof mouthpiece for the Moore campaign, even when the campaign could barely\nspeak on its own behalf. Indeed, Breitbart leader and former Trump White House\nadvisor Steve Bannon directly campaigned for Moore, framing the candidate as a\nTrumpian, anti-establishment vanguard of a new ultra-conservative takeover of\nCongress (even though the president backed Strange in the primaries). It seems\nnow that even Bannon's underlings knew Moore was a poor choice for Bannon's\nplanned conservative insurrection, an effort that now appears dead in the\nwater. As if it needs to be said, the cynicism of a news outlet backing a\ncandidate it knows to be a poor politician -- and perhaps an even worse person\n-- for the benefit of another potentially equally compromised figure is\ntitanic. But then again, there has never been anything idealistic or pure\nabout Breitbart's support of the president or, indeed, the president's support\nof the hard-right racial, political and cultural agenda that publication and\nits followers espouse. They are all \"useful idiots\" for each other. With that\nas the power exchange active in both conservative politics and conservative\nmedia, it only stands to reason that a \"terrible,\" \"horrible\" candidate such\nas Moore would go so far and create so much noise standing on their shoulders.\nListen to the whole segment below.\n\n",

They swear that they only want the \"bad\" guns. Maybe they'll\nsay, \"No one needs an assault rifle\" but if you mention bans on bolt action\nguns or handguns, they start backing up with their hands in supplication. \"No,\nno, no, no. No one wants to do anything about those,\" he'll say. That means\nhe's [either wrong or lying](https://crooked.com/article/bring-gun-fight/).\nDemocratic politicians have been brainwashed by political hacks like me to\nbegin all of their statements about guns by declaring support for the Second\nAmendment and a deep affinity for the cultures of hunters and sportsmen--even\nif they themselves have never fired weapons. We call them \"gun safety\"\nproposals instead of \"gun control\" measures because pollsters and consultants\ndivined that \"gun safety\" would be less alarming to gun voters, and that gun\nvoters were to be coddled at all cost. The Democratic gun control strategy\nfails because it is defined by this poverty of ambition--the determination\nnever to look beyond fear of political repercussions. Universal background\nchecks and a ban on high-capacity magazines are good ideas and we should seize\nthe opportunity to enact them if it presents itself. But they won't come\nanywhere close to making gun violence in America a tolerable problem. We are\nnibbling around the edges instead of proposing bold, meaningful solutions such\nas: A national gun registry, so law-enforcement officials can know when\nsomeone is compiling an arsenal. The government can track purchases of allergy\nmedicines that can be used to make methamphetamine, and fertilizers that can\nbe used to make bombs, like the one used in Oklahoma City in 1994, but not\ndeadly assault weapons. That's absurd. Tracking and limiting purchases of\nammunition. Requiring that guns use smart-gun technology, which would\ndramatically reduce accidental deaths, particularly among children, who,\n[according to a 2016 study](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/child-dies-every-\nday-gun-accidents-u-s/), are dying accidental deaths at the hands of guns at\nthe rate of one every other day. A national gun buyback program similar to the\none Australia instituted after a mass shooting that killed 35 people. That\nincident was in 1996. There hasn't been another one since, These proposals are\nessentially omitted from the national conversation largely because Democrats\nare scared that the NRA will spin them disingenuously to inflame gun owners.\nAgain, Democrats presume their hand is the weaker of the two. Last week,\nRepublicans rejoiced, and some Democrats winced privately, when Nancy Pelosi\n[said](https://www.c-span.org/video/?435202-1/house-minority-leader-pelosi-\nbriefs-reporters) she hoped regulation of bump stocks--the device the Las\nVegas shooter used to make his weapon more deadly--would be a \"slippery slope\"\nto further regulation. Democrats were concerned that Pelosi had handed the NRA\na political cudgel the group would brandish against every one of them. But\nPelosi was right, and I would like to see more Democrats find her courage,\nbecause the alternative is to surrender our ideals, and the moral high ground,\nfor no discernible upside. Written by former Obama staffer Dan Pfeiffer who\nseems absolutely in love with gun control. After all, he calls for a national\ngun buyback program similar to Australia's but fails to inform his readers\nthat the buyback was simply a more palatable gun confiscation program\nmasquerading as choice. Then again, this is the guy who says this, followed by\nclaiming, \"Republicans currently control every branch of government and the\nNRA is still [producing\nagitprop](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/nra-ad-the-violence-\nof-\nlies/2017/06/30/295dde84-5d93-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_video.html?utm_term=.4ee3dfeae927)\naimed at convincing gun owners that liberal Democrats and radical leftists are\ngoing to come after their guns.\" He says this without a hint of irony at the\nfact that he is telling Democrats to come after our guns. The entire post is\nnothing more than a paper dedicated to trying to convince Democrats that the\nanswer to guns is to move even more to the left on guns, to stop pretending\nthat they don't want all the guns, yet he has the nerve to blame the NRA for\nproducing videos? It should be noted that the video he chose is the one where\nDana Loesch calls out the leftist media for lying. It actually doesn't say a\nthing about how Democrats want all the guns. Not that it matters to someone\nlike Pfeiffer. All that matters is that Democrats aren't being honest about\ncoming after all of our guns. He's annoyed they won't be honest, but I'm going\nto let Dan know something. We already know they want them all, and that's why\nno one is backing down. Especially since none of his proposals would have\nstopped Las Vegas.\n\n",

            "input": "The readers of my column are well aware I'm not a fan of MGM CEO Jim Murren.\nI've called him \"the worst CEO in America\" because he entangled his company in\nradical leftist politics -- including the Council on American-Islamic\nRelations, an organization tied to terror and called by many experts a front\ngroup for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. I actually felt bad for MGM when\nthis tragedy first happened. But could it have happened to any Vegas resort?\nOr were there factors at play that led to this property being chosen for this\nterrible mass murder? Murren was appointed by Barack Obama to the Homeland\nSecurity Council. From that perch, Murren had insider access to the detailed\nthreats aimed at Vegas. What did he do to prepare and adequately safeguard his\nguests? Several MGM security guards and ex-security guards have called my\nradio show in recent days. They described MGM's security as \"woefully\nundertrained and understaffed.\" One ex-MGM security guard called to say\nMurren's first act in taking over Luxor and Mandalay Bay was to disarm most of\nthe guards and declare MGM hotels \"gun-free\" zones. Maybe that's why the\nshooter chose Mandalay Bay. Why has the timeline involving Mandalay Bay guard\nJesus Campos changed so many times? Did he approach the shooter's room before\nor after the mass murder started? If it was before, why weren't the police\ncalled? Did the shooter choose a MGM property because VIP high roller clients\nwere free to use service elevators, thereby avoiding scrutiny? Finally, was\nthe CEO of MGM focused on his properties? Was the security of his customers a\nmain priority? Or was he distracted? SEC records for September reveal more\nthan $200 million in stock selloffs from MGM officers and directors. From July\n31 to early September, Murren sold more than 80 percent of his MGM stock. This\ncertainly paints the picture of a CEO with a lack of faith in his own company.\nOr did Murren have one foot out the door? Was he distracted and uninterested,\nperhaps making plans to leave? Why else would a CEO sell off a large majority\nof the shares he owns in his own company? Was Murren focused on MGM security\nas a major terror attack was being planned at his property? Or was he too busy\nselling off his shares, at the right price, into the open market, without Wall\nStreet noticing? MGM's top executives and key board members also sold huge\namounts of stock in September. How about this eye-popping number? In the past\nthree months, according to SEC Form 4, MGM insiders sold off 6,387,163 shares.\nGuess how many those same insiders bought? Zero. Also in September, while\nMGM's CEO and insiders were selling off huge amounts of their own company\nstock, MGM announced a billion-dollar stock buyback program. In other words,\nthey used \"other people's money\" to buy back MGM stock on the open market to\nprop up the price. Talk about the world's worst conflict of interest.\nShareholders were forced to spend $1 billion to buy \"undervalued MGM stock\" at\nthe same time the CEO and his team couldn't wait to get out. Question: What if\nMGM had used that same $1 billion to upgrade security or hire twice as many\nsecurity staff instead of to prop up its stock price while the CEO was\nselling? Lastly, did Murren sign for a special \"terrorism rider\" on MGM's\nliability insurance policy? Will a designation of \"terrorism\" vs. criminal\nmass murder affect the payout from the insurance policy? Could declaring this\na terror act change MGM's bottom line by billions of dollars?

            "input": "Hurricane Harvey reveals an America that many in the media seem not to know\nexists: a multi-ethnic, multiracial country where people, for the most part,\nget along. For those who claim that President Donald Trump \"coarsened\" our\npolitics and \"set back race relations,\" Hurricane Harvey was pretty bad\noptics. Only weeks ago, some Democrats were counting the days toward Trump's\nimpeachment and an early departure from the presidency. But last week they saw\nTrump, in Texas, looking quite presidential in his role as comforter in chief.\nThey saw photos of a president soothing and embracing survivors, no matter\ntheir race or gender or sexual orientation. If he is a germaphobe, his fear\nmust be in remission, as he hugged adult survivors and held kids in his arms.\nTexans, including black ones, appeared pleased by Trump's visit even as\nDemocrats like Maxine Waters have denounced him as \"racist,\" calling for his\nimpeachment as Harvey was bearing down on Texas. Imagine this: neighbors\nhelping neighbors, irrespective of race. But really, this is an old American\nstory. Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville traveled to this fascinating new\ncountry called the United States of America in the 1830s. He wrote about what\nhe considered an astonishing number of \"mutual aid societies,\" or charitable\norganizations and clubs set up to help a community's needy. Tocqueville wrote:\n\"Americans group together to hold fetes, found seminaries, build inns,\nconstruct churches, distribute books, dispatch missionaries to the antipodes.\nThey establish hospitals, prisons, schools by the same method. Finally, if\nthey wish to highlight a truth or develop an opinion by the encouragement of a\ngreat example, they form an association. ... \"The love and respect of your\nneighbors must be gained by a long series of small services, hidden deeds of\ngoodness, a persistent habit of kindness, and an established reputation of\nselflessness. ... I have seen Americans making great and sincere sacrifices\nfor the key common good and a hundred times I have noticed that, when needs\nbe, they almost always gave each other faithful support.\" Tocqueville\nconsidered Americans' remarkable spirit of charitable giving a matter of\nenlightened self-interest: \"American moralists do not claim that one must\nsacrifice oneself for one's fellows because it is a fine thing to do but they\nare bold enough to say that such sacrifices are as necessary to the man who\nmakes them as to those gaining from them. ... They do not, therefore, deny\nthat every man can pursue his own self-interest but they turn themselves\ninside out to prove that it is in each man's interest to be virtuous. ...\nEnlightened self-love continually leads them to help one another and inclines\nthem to devote freely a part of their time and wealth to the welfare of the\nstate.\" America just elected and re-elected a black president. Still,\nPresident Barack Obama famously said racism is \"still part of (America's)\nDNA.\" Well, America's DNA clearly changed, and dramatically so. In 1958, when\nGallup asked whether Americans would vote for a black person for president, 54\npercent said, \"No.\" A 2006 Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll found just 3\npercent of Republicans and 4 percent of Democrats said they would not vote for\na black presidential candidate. In fact, more Americans (14 percent) said they\nwould not vote for a Mormon or a 72-year-old than the number who refused to\nvote for a black president. In the 1950s, interracial black-white marriages\nwere extremely rare. Today, intermarriage of all races and ethnicities\naccounts for 17 percent of all marriages. This is why sane observers of O.J.\nSimpson's 1995 murder trial considered its defense a joke: that LAPD officers,\nincluding an Asian-American criminalist, seething at Simpson for having\nmarried a blue-eyed blonde, leaped at their opportunity to frame him. In\nliberal Los Angeles, where intermarriage is common? In the 1950s over 90\npercent of Americans disapproved of black-white marriages, while recent polls\nsay about 90 percent approve. If America were as racist as many in the media\nthink, why do blacks excel in two of the most competitive fields -- sports and\nentertainment? On Forbes' list of highest-earning celebrities, blacks occupy\nseven of the top 25 slots, including Sean Combs, who clocks in at $130 million\nannually; Beyonce at $105 million; and Drake at $94 million. On Forbes' list\nof highest-earning athletes, blacks occupy 13 of the top 25 spots, including\nLeBron James at $86 million; Kevin Durant at $60 million; and Stephen Curry at\n$47 million. Watch out, Trump-hating media. As more blacks recognize that\nRepublicans are not out to get them, and they look at cities like Detroit\nunder Democratic leadership, Trump can potentially tip the black vote in his\nparty's direction more than any Republican since Abraham Lincoln.

We know, for\nexample, that former President Clinton engineered a meeting with President\nObama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on the tarmac of the Phoenix Airport\non June 27, 2016. That's the official story, replete with the charming and\nintentionally disarming detail that all they talked about was their\ngrandchildren. It was just coincidental, don't you know, that at the time the\nFBI was looking into Hillary Clinton's use of a \"personal\" email server to\nsend, receive and store classified information. And it was also simply\ncoincidental that just a few days later, the director of the FBI - who served\nunder Attorney General Lynch - announced that he wouldn't recommend a\nprosecution of Hillary Clinton. Richard Nixon must be rolling over in his\ngrave. What we haven't known, until now, is that a frantic scramble erupted in\nthe halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting. What we haven't known, until\nnow, is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up\nthis meeting. In fact, the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous\nmeeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton - but rather on one of\nthe whistleblowers who got the word out. The organization I head, Judicial\nWatch, asked the FBI on July 7, 2016, for any records that might pertain to\nthe infamous tarmac meeting. We had to sue after we were ignored by the\nagency. Then the FBI told us flat-out that it couldn't find any records. And\nwe now know that was flat-out untrue. Because, in responding to another one of\nour Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, the Justice Department\n](http://video.foxnews.com/v/5664370032001/clinton-lynch-tarmac-meeting-\ntriggered-fbi-hunt-for-leaker)gave us heavily redacted documents that showed\nthere were additional documents tucked away at the FBI headquarters. If not\nfor Judicial Watch's lawsuits these documents would still be hidden today.\nBecause of the revelation in our other lawsuit, the FBI - without our\nknowledge--\"reopened\" our FOIA request. The agency supposedly found about 30\npages of information, which it needed six weeks to review. The FBI finally\ngave them to us late Thursday. Now we know why the FBI played shell games. The\n[documents](https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-\ndoj-02046-clinton-lynch-tarmac-records/) show that FBI officials were\nconcerned solely about the leaking of details of the tarmac meeting. None of\nthe documents show top agency officials cared one whit about the propriety of\nthe meeting itself, but only about who blew the whistle on the covert tete-a-\ntete. In one email, an FBI official writes \"we need to find that guy.\" And in\nanother we learn that the Phoenix FBI office was contacted \"in an attempt to\nstem any further damage.\" An FBI official working on Lynch's security detail\neven goes so far as to suggest non-disclosure agreements to keep the full\nfacts from coming forth. No wonder the FBI didn't turn these documents over\nuntil we caught it red-handed, hiding and lying about them. Simply put, the\nFBI appears to be fully complicit in a cover-up that attempted to influence a\npresidential election for a favored candidate - Hillary Clinton.

In fact, it seems like the only time you see a crime committed with\na suppressor, it's where having the suppressor itself is illegal for whatever\nreason. They're just not used that way very often. However, if the Hearing\nProtection Act passes as part of the SHARE Act, suppressors will likely become\nfar more common. That has the hysterical tribe at The Trace worried about\ncriminals getting [their grubby little paws on them via\ntheft](https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/if-silencers-become-easier-to-buy-will-\nmore-be-stolen/). Congress could [vote as soon as this\nweek](https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/gun-silencer-vote-house-share-act/) to\nrepeal part of an 80-year-old law that has forced owners of silencers to\nregister the devices with the federal government. Supporters of removing\nrestrictions on silencers have dismissed the concerns of opponents by pointing\nout that suppressors, as they're also known, are today rarely used in crimes.\nThe more pertinent public safety question, however, is what could happen if\nmany more silencers enter circulation. Even with the hurdles that silencer\nbuyers must deal with, demand for the items is already increasing, fueled by a\nnew generation of suppressors and some slick marketing. There are now more\nthat 1.3 million of them registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms and Explosives, up from about 360,000 just five years ago. There's\nalso evidence to suggest that as silencers have gained a foothold with gun\nowners, some are winding up in the black market. [We've written\nbefore](https://www.thetrace.org/2016/12/americas-obsession-powerful-handguns-\nrising-gunshot-lethality/) that as goes the legal gun industry, so goes the\ncriminal arsenal. Firearms and related tools like [extended\nmagazines](https://www.thetrace.org/2017/03/high-capacity-magazine-ban-\nbaltimore-police/) that are initially sold legally end up in criminals' hands\nin several ways: unregulated private transactions, straw purchases and, of\ncourse, theft. To be sure, theft is a legitimate concern. It's impossible to\nkeep things out of criminals' hands because they're often acquired via theft,\neither directly or indirectly on the black market. I'd like to applaud The\nTrace for at least acknowledging that criminals are unlikely to walk into a\ngun store and buy suppressors. Good for them. Make no mistake, criminals will\nget their hands on suppressors via theft. It's going to happen, unfortunately.\nOf course, criminals can make suppressors in their garage right now. All the\ninformation is on the internet for anyone and their brother to look at if they\nso choose. It's been that way for years. Yet they're still rarely used in\ncrime. Why is that? Take a look at this photo of a suppressed pistol, since\nhandguns are the preferred weapon of the average criminal. Note that the\nsuppressor extends well beyond the weapon. In fact, it doubles the overall\nlength of the weapon. Guess what this does? It makes it very, very difficult\nto hide a suppressed firearm. Seriously, try tucking one of those in the front\nof your pants sometime and see how quickly you draw. This makes suppressors\nvery difficult to sneak into a convenience store. It's also difficult to mill\nabout waiting for someone to pull the gun on and rob. While criminals will, no\ndoubt, get their hands on suppressors in the course of their \"career,\" it\nwon't really help them much. They're terrible options for their line of work,\nand with the internet's instructions laying the mysteries of the suppressor\nbare years ago, there's no reason to fear them getting into any crooks hands.\nThey're likely already there, and they figure out quickly they're useless for\ntheir purposes.\n\n",

Back when they needed our votes before the last\nelection, Republicans were hairy-chested warriors, vowing to block Obama's\nunconstitutional \"executive amnesty\" -- if only voters gave them a Senate\nmajority. The resulting Republican landslide suggested some opposition to\namnesty. Heading into the election, college professor Dave Brat took out the\nsitting House majority leader and amnesty-supporter Eric Cantor in a primary,\ndespite being outspent 40-1. It was the greatest upset in history since the\n1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" at the Lake Placid Olympics: Never before has a House\nmajority leader been defeated in a primary. And Brat did it by an astonishing\n55.5 percent to 45.5 percent. Again, the voters seemed to be expressing\ndisquiet with amnesty. After that, even amnesty-supporting Sen. Lamar\nAlexander, R-Tenn., was denouncing Obama's executive amnesty. \"If the\npresident were to do that,\" he said, \"and we have a Republican majority in the\nUnited States Senate, why, we have a number of options that we don't now have\nto remind him to read Article I of the Constitution.\" Poll after poll showed\nAmericans ranking illegal immigration as the No. 1 most important problem\nfacing the nation. We haven't changed our minds. Last week, an Associated\nPress-Gfk poll showed that Obama's single most unpopular policy is his\nposition on illegal immigration. In other words, Obamacare is more popular\nthan amnesty. That's like losing a popularity contest to Ted Bundy. Since at\nleast 2006, voters have insistently told pollsters they don't want amnesty.\nSeemingly bulletproof Republican congressmen have lost their seats over\namnesty. President Bush lost the entire House of Representatives over amnesty.\nWhat else do we have to do to convince you we don't want amnesty, Republicans?\nMake it a host on \"The View\"? Before the election, then-Senate Minority Leader\nMitch McConnell complained that Obama's decision to delay his executive\namnesty until after the election was a ploy to prevent Americans from\n\"hold(ing) his party accountable in the November elections.\" But voters went\nahead and held Obama accountable! Now McConnell is Senate majority leader --\nand he claims his hands are tied. McConnell's spokesman at the National\nRepublican Senatorial Committee, Brad Dayspring, predicted that Obama's\namnesty threat would drive voters to \"elect a new Senate (that) will stand up\nto the president.\" Check! Mission accomplished! Done and done! Officially off\nour bucket list. OK, guys, your turn. When do you start standing up to the\npresident? Hello? Hell-oooo? To gin up votes, \"Republican insiders\" told the\nWashington Examiner last fall that \"the results of the midterm elections\"\nwould determine how \"aggressive\" the GOP would be in fighting Obama's amnesty.\nVoters gave you a blow-out victory, Republicans. You cleaned their clocks.\n(Have you seen Harry Reid lately?) Where's that promised aggression on\namnesty? Republicans and George Will tell us they can't stand up to Obama's\nexecutive amnesty because the media are unfair. Oh, well, in that case, never\nmind! This is news to them? They didn't know the media were unfair when they\nwere promising to block Obama's illegal amnesty before the elections? The\nmedia have blamed the GOP for every failure of Republicans and Democrats to\nreach an agreement since the Hoover administration. This isn't a surprise\ndevelopment. Why don't Republicans attack the media? People hate the media!\nTheir power is eroding -- and it would erode a lot faster if Congress would\nchallenge them. Instead of submitting to the media's blackmail, my suggestion\nis, take their gun away. Tell voters what the media won't: that Obama's\n\"amnesty\" will give illegal aliens Social Security cards and three years of\nback-payments through the Earned Income Tax Credit, even though they never\npaid taxes in the first place. Could we get a poll on that: Should the\ngovernment issue work permits to illegal aliens and give them each $25,000 in\nU.S. taxpayer money? I promise you, Obama would lose that vote by at least\n80-20. Even people who are against hounding illegal aliens out of the country\naren't clamoring to open the U.S. Treasury to them. Tell voters that the media\nare refusing to report on Senate Democrats' weeks-long filibuster against a\nGOP bill that would defund Obama's illegal \"amnesty.\" Contrary to hysterical\nclaims by the media and George Will, the government won't shut down if the\nDemocrats' filibuster goes on forever. The government is funded! Only the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) will be \"defunded.\" Which means, let's\nsee ... I'm counting on my fingers ... yes, that's right: NOTHING. Nearly all\nDHS employees are deemed \"essential\" personnel who are required to stay on the\njob even if the department's budget doesn't pass -- the Secret Service, the\nTransportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard. Approximately\n200,000 of DHS's 230,000 employees are required to keep working through what\nthe media will hysterically call a \"government shutdown.\" By \"government\nshutdown,\" the media mean: \"some secretaries will not go to work.\" Why don't\nRepublicans spend all their airtime attacking the media for lying about what\nObama's amnesty does and what the Democrats are doing? It's hard to avoid\nconcluding that Republicans aren't trying to make the right arguments. In\nfact, it kind of looks like they're intentionally throwing the fight on\namnesty. If a Republican majority in both houses of Congress can't stop Obama\nfrom issuing illegal immigrants Social Security cards and years of back\nwelfare payments, there is no reason to vote Republican ever again.

This includes\nwater bottles and those used for other beverages, like sodas and sugary sports\ndrinks, and the demand for them is only increasing despite global efforts to\nstem plastic usage in the bud. Plastic bags and bottles ravage the Earth from\nproduction to disposal, and yet humans buy approximately one million bottles\nper minute, according to\n[Euromonitor](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/a-million-a-\nminute-worlds-plastic-bottle-binge-as-dangerous-as-climate-change), a market\nresearch group. Those numbers are expected to increase by another 20% by 2021,\nwhich will devastate climate, beaches, oceans, and all of the animals that\nreside in these areas. According to figures from\n[Euromonitor](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/a-million-a-\nminute-worlds-plastic-bottle-binge-as-dangerous-as-climate-change), humans\nbought 480 billion plastic bottles in the year 2016, which is 300 billion more\nthan the numbers from a decade ago. To make matters worse, less than half of\nthose bottles was collected for recycling and only about 7% of those collected\nwere turned into new bottles. Manufacturers complain that using recycled\nplastic ruins the appeal of the bottles and that it costs more to use these\nmaterials, which will fall on the consumer. Experts speculate that this demand\nfor 20,000 bottles per second has been exacerbated by the on-the-go, urban\nculture that has taken over in cities in China and the Asia Pacific region.\nWith an increased population comes a rise in the demand for PET (polyethylene\nterephthalate) bottles, which is why Chinese citizens bought 73.8 billion\nbottles last year, up more than 5 billion since the year before it. \"[China]\nis a critical country to understand when examining global sales of plastic PET\nbottles, and China's requirement for plastic bottles continues to expand,\"\nsaid Euromonitor's head of packaging, [Rosemary\nDowney](https://www.fastcompany.com/40436286/good-lord-the-world-is-using-\nalmost-500-billion-plastic-water-bottles-a-\nyear?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds). It's not enough that reusable\nwater bottles are trending right now because that doesn't help the nations who\ncan't trust the cleanliness of their tap water. This surge in buying plastic\nbottles is also largely driven by developing countries, where disposability is\nmore important than sustainability and being eco-friendly. \"This increase is\nbeing driven by increased urbanization,\" [Downey\nsaid](https://www.fastcompany.com/40436286/good-lord-the-world-is-using-\nalmost-500-billion-plastic-water-bottles-a-year). \"There is a desire for\nhealthy living and there are ongoing concerns about groundwater contamination\nand the quality of tap water, which all contribute to the increase in bottle\nwater use.\" Credit: Bottle Ban If municipalities would clean up their water or\nwork to provide safe drinking water to certain regions for the first time,\nit's likely that plastic pollution, especially when it comes to bottles, would\ndecline dramatically and slow the environmental health crisisthat is building\nevery day. Sadly, it's estimated that approximately 5 to 13 million tons of\nplastic leak into the ocean every single year, ultimately to be worn down into\nfragments that float in the water column and can sometimes become a part of\none of the many garbage patches. Fish, sea birds, and other marine life will\neat the specks of plastic or even consume larger pieces, which can eventually\nkill them. Since humans consume a variety of fish from the ocean, these\nplastics can also make their way onto our dinner plates. \"The plastic\npollution crisis rivals the threat of climate change as it pollutes every\nnatural system and an increasing number of organisms on planet Earth,\" [said\nHugo Tagholm](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/a-million-a-\nminute-worlds-plastic-bottle-binge-as-dangerous-as-climate-change), the CEO of\nSurfers Against Sewage. \"Current science shows that plastics cannot be\nusefully assimilated into the food chain. Where they are ingested they carry\ntoxins that work their way on to our dinner plates.\" There are several\nsolutions that groups and experts have suggested to reduce the number of\nplastic bottle usage, ranging from cutting bottles out cold turkey to\nencouraging a payment system to use plastic bottles. While some places, like\nSan Francisco, banned the sale of plastic bottles, other groups advocate for\nwhat's called a circular economy. In the circular economy, plastic bottles\nwould be used, recycled, refilled, and reused, effectively reducing waste.\nSurfers Against Sewage is currently campaigning for a [deposit return\nsystem](https://medium.com/surfers-against-sewage/what-is-a-deposit-return-\nsystem-99d05ef34be2) to be implemented in the UK, which the equivalent of CRV\nthat is collected in the U.S. that can be returned to people that recycle\ntheir bottles or cans. If you aren't compelled by these reasons to stop using\nplastic bottles, consider what your beaches will look like once plastic\ndominates the world even more. Remote islands with little to no beach clean-\nups have shown evidence of extreme pollution along their coast and upwards of\n18 tons on their beaches, revealing what the future of even the nicest beaches\nwill be. Consider purchasing a reusable water bottle today and making a huge\ndifference for the environment.\n\n",

            "input": "This past weekend, I took a camping trip with my dad and older brother. We sat\naround a camp fire drinking beers, talking politics, reminiscing, and acting\nlike a couple of teenage boys degenerating into far lower forms of\nconversation. There were no kids, no wives, and no distractions--male bonding\nat its finest. It was everything I needed in a break from the daily grind of\nhaving to be the guy who deals with people beating, stabbing, shooting,\nstealing from, and lying about each other for a living. It's the youngest I've\nseen the old man look, the most laid back I've seen my brother act, and the\nmost humbled I've felt in years. I'm glad we did it. I don't get to see my old\nman very often anymore since I moved across the country, and I almost forgot\nhow hilarious he can be. As a retired cop himself, he's able to bounce back\nand forth between sidesplittingly entertaining stories and philosophical and\nprofound ones before bringing it back around and making you laugh all over\nagain. It's the type of unique style that can only develop in a man who has\nput in 26 years on the job and lived to tell about it. I could go on all day\nabout the tales told, laughs had, and lessons learned, but there's one story\nin particular that is sticking out in my mind today now that the image of\nKathy Griffin holding up the [severed\nhead](https://www.tmz.com/2017/05/30/kathy-griffin-beheads-donald-trump-photo-\ntyler-shields/) of our president has broken the internet. One of the main\nreasons Pop's stories have so much depth and detail is because he patrolled\nthe streets of the same city as an adult that he once called his stomping\ngrounds as a kid. It wasn't uncommon for some of the most ridiculous people\nhe'd dealt with as a cop to have been his friends or schoolmates at one point\nin time. A shining example of this was the time my old man found himself\nwrapped up in a childhood acquaintance's plot to assassinate President Reagan.\nOne fateful night, Joe Blow had two or ten drinks too many and sat himself\ndown behind the wheel of a car that ultimately paved his way straight to a\njail cell on a DUI. My dad, along with a few other local boys turned cops,\nknew Blow growing up, and their names started getting thrown around by the\ndrunken clown as soon as he parked his butt in the drunk tank to dry out.\nDrunks are pure entertainment for cops up until the point where they get in\nthe way of us going home on time. It's not unusual for their ranting and\nraving to lead to demanding things like water, trips to the restroom, phone\ncalls, and all kinds of other earthly desires, as was the case with Blow.\nEventually, the ridiculous behavior and name-dropping piqued someone's\ninterest enough to call Lefever and find out what he knew about this guy. No\ncompatible source was found for this video. By the time Pop answered the phone\nin the middle of the night, his buddies are down at the precinct having a good\nold time laughing and joking at the expense of an individual who was obviously\nmaking a fool of himself. Instead of asking nicely for a cup of water or to\nuse the restroom, Blow had been calling these guys every name in the book and\ntelling them they had better do as he says. In the same way you don't give\ninto the demands of a child throwing a temper tantrum, the officers are giving\nhim what he deserves--absolutely nothing. Eventually, Blow makes his big\nmistake when he shrieks, \"Well if you don't give me a glass of water, I'm\ngonna kill President Reagan!\" To this day, Pop doesn't know who put pen to\npaper, but the Secret Service found out about Blow's empty threats to\nassassinate the president over a glass of water that he had nothing to do with\ntwo states away. Blow's drunken rampage went down early on in Reagan's first\nterm, and the prez made at least three trips to Jersey in the following eight\nyears. Blow was put on lockdown each time for the duration of the visit. Years\nlater, my dad had a Curb Your Enthusiasm moment with the guy at a high school\nreunion because Blow held him responsible for his place on a Secret Service\nwatch list for almost a decade. You play stupid games and you win stupid\nprizes, they say. I'm guessing Dutch didn't get his vote in the second term.\nAll joking aside, four presidents have been assassinated while holding office,\nand an additional fourteen have survived actual attempts or failed plots on\ntheir lives. Make no mistake about it--the threat is as grave or worse for\nPresident Trump as it has been for any president to ever sit in the Oval\nOffice. Despite the fact that Trump's name is not included on Wikipedia's\n[list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots)\nof US presidential assassination attempts and plots, I'd argue that he's\nfacing greater danger than many of the former presidents inhabiting the list\never were. Just look at the ever-escalating flirtation with Trump death\nthreats made by celebrities. My earliest memory of this was\n[Pitbull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AB6u6K2wIs) shouting to Trump,\n\"Watch out for El Chapo, Dude!\" after ripping him at the Univision Awards. A\nshort time later, we had\n[Eminem](https://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/05/eminem.lyrics/)\nrapping \"I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president dead\"\nin his song \"We as Americans.\" Then, there was [Snoop\nDogg](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/03/13/snoop-dogg-\nshoots-fake-president-trump-new-video-lavender/99139774/) holding a gun to a\nclown depicted to be Trump and pulling the trigger in his music video for\nLavender. Who can forget about Bow Wow's Twitter rant threatening to pimp the\nFirst Lady or Sarah Silverman's call for the US military to get rid of Trump?\nWhile it is no secret that publicity-starved and emotionally stunted Hollywood\ntypes have a time-honored tradition of one-upmanship and grandstanding to the\npoint of absurdity, fantasizing over Trump's death went too far the moment\nthey declared it in vogue. What started as a refusal to accept the results of\na democratically held election has turned into Kathy Griffin doing her best\nISIS impression on the president of our country. The worst part about the\nwhole thing is that most people blamed the beheading stunt on Carrot Top. As a\ncop, I'm an expert witness--but I can see how many have been fooled. Therefore\nI've created this meme to show the American people that Carrot Top has been\nwrongfully accused. I hate to use the word \"normalize\" in the same way I hate\nto use the word \"problematic,\" because both come almost exclusively out of the\nmouths of social justice warrior liberals who believe the guy who invented\nwhite chocolate is racist. In this case, however, I'll go ahead and do it. The\nway in which the killing of President Trump is being normalized is reckless\nand inexcusable. Speaking of reckless and inexcusable--lest we forget who lit\nthe torch for the 2017 Trump Assassination Olympics just in time for the\ninauguration back in January, it was none other than CNN, who ran a\n[segment](https://video.foxnews.com/v/5290422982001/?#sp=show-clips) captioned\n\"Disaster Could Put Obama Cabinet Member in Oval Office.\" Calling a network\nthat muses of a newly elected president and his inner circle being murdered\nthe Clinton News Network or Crap News Network just doesn't suffice here. I\nprefer the Caliphate News Network. After all, it is CNN who has been allowing\nKathy Griffin to host their coverage of New Year's Eve in Times Square since\n2013. Will they separate themselves this year, or will the 11 people tuning in\nbe seeing the ball drop replaced with President Trump's dismembered head\nfalling from his body? While the Secret Service has already opened\ninvestigations on some of the celebrities I mentioned above without going so\nfar as to put them on a watch list, many people are calling for Kathy Griffin\nto be locked up. If Joe Blow can be placed on a watch list for eight years for\nhis drunken rant against Reagan, I'm all for Griffin, Snoop, Bow Wow, Eminem,\nPitbull, Silverman, and the entire CNN production team responsible for the\nassassination segment getting scooped up and placed under supervision anytime\nTrump comes to town. May he do us all a favor and come to town often.\n\n",

As we previously informed you all, Quantasia claimed that\nshe'd met Usher at his concert and then had a one night stand with him later\nthat night, without him telling her that he allegedly has herpes… Fans Called\nAccuser's Bluff It was her details ( and the prior lies she was accused of\ntelling about other celebs) that caused many Usher fans to call her bluff\nthough. Sharpton claimed that after Usher's concert, she went back to her Days\nInn hotel room and Usher called her, then went to Days Inn to sex her up like\nColor Me Badd (okay she didn't say the Color Me Badd part, but if the shoe\nfits…). Anywho, after fans heard her 'Days Inn' claim, they were like 'Chile\nplease…Usher ain't rollin' up to a cheap Days Inn hotel room to have sex with\nyou.' Attorney Lisa Bloom with her client/Usher accuser, Quantasia Days Inn\nEmployee's Claims Days later, an alleged Days Inn worker then claimed she saw\nUsher walk into the hotel to go see Quantasia. The worker also said the only\nreason she revealed that is because she didn't like that Usher reportedly said\nto the press that Quantasia isn't \"his type.\" Many Usher fans didn't buy the\nemployee's story either.

Usher tells them at the time of his\nalleged encounter, Grace was his manager and they spent ALL their free time\ntogether.

            "input": "The German public have, as predicted, kept ahold of nurse. But it is the\nbreakthrough of the AfD into the German Parliament that is causing headlines\naround the world. Of course the four-year old party's electoral success is\nalso unsurprising. In elections last September the AfD were elected to\nrepresentative roles in most of the country's regional assemblies and beat\nMerkel's party into third place in her own constituency. Nevertheless,\nyesterday's electoral breakthrough is stunning and the success of this four-\nyear-old party is among other things now causing a predictable rash of 1930s\nanalogies. In a media landscape where very few papers can afford any foreign\ncoverage at all, and a social media landscape which blows around slightly\nsourced stories with a further splash of personal self-aggrandisement,\nunderstanding a phenomenon like the AfD is harder than it should be. Many\nEuropeans find themselves caught. Firstly by the fact that the mainstream\npolitical class has done something mad in recent years. As I recently\n[explained](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strange-Death-Europe-Immigration-\nIdentity/dp/1472942248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506348394&sr=8-1&keywords=douglas+murray%27s+the+strange+death+of+europe)\nat book-length, it is inevitable that things will get complicated when the\npeople in charge of Europe make decisions as appalling as those Angela Merkel\nmade in 2015. What she occasioned in unilaterally opening the continent's\ndoors to the world may have been humanitarian and may have had some good\nintentions. But it was also reckless, short-sighted and will cause severe\nissues for German society for generations to come. Most of that impact -\nincluding the daily reports of crime and sexual assault - never make it\nfurther than the German-language press, and often not even there. What are the\npublic to do when their leaders and media behave like this? One idea is that\nthe public shouldn't have any choice and should be forced to keep voting for\nthe same old parties anyway. This obviously suits the incumbents, and is best\nachieved by depicting any and all parties concerned about immigration -\nincluding the mass immigration which people across the political spectrum now\nsay they acknowledge to have been an unrepeatable disaster - as Nazis,\nfascists and racists. The incumbent politicians and parties acknowledge they\nhave made mistakes, promise not to repeat those mistakes but insist that\nanyone wishing to make them pay any political price must recognise that they\nare voting for a Fourth Reich. It's a clever, cynical ploy, employed by\npoliticians and much of the media across Germany even more than the UK. Their\nproblem is that at some point the public recognise the ploy. And in particular\na moment arrives when the spell-words used by the political mainstream begin\nto fail. Already terms like 'racist', 'Nazi', 'far-right' have been worn down\nalmost everywhere in Europe. The few people who continue to claim that the\npublic's concerns are all racist are themselves the ones who now look\nridiculous. All they do is ensure that the public care less and less about the\nwords they are called. This has a follow-on problem which is especially worth\npondering in Germany. For if the media and political class call everybody a\nracist and a Nazi for years, and the public can see that these people often\ncalled racists and Nazis (Ukip in Britain, for instance) are - whatever else\nyou might think of them - clearly not Nazis or racists, then you set up\nanother problem down the road. Anyone who has heard a hundred different people\nbeing called Nazis who they knew not to be Nazis is unlikely to have their\nanti-Nazi antennae intact when the accusation is made for the hundred and\nfirst time. This is among the problems that Merkel and co have now set up. The\nAfD's platform and pronouncements require close and unbiased attention. This\nshould include having their words and actions reported accurately. To her\ncredit, Merkel - the great absorber of political difference - has said that\nshe will work to bring back the people who voted AfD this weekend. This\nsuggests that she might - just might - take what is essentially the second\nbroad option for Europe's political mainstream. That is to stop pretending\nthat anything from a quarter to three-quarters of the general public across\nEurope are Nazi, fascist, racists who need to be reprogrammed, fought,\ndenounced or ignored. Instead it is to recognise that the concerns of the\npublic are concerns that should be addressed and remedied by the political\nmainstream. Which isn't, surely, such a radical idea. We'll see which path\nGermany now goes down. More than Germany's politics will depend on it.\n\n",

            "input": "A remarkable thing happened recently. You might have missed it, because while\nit happened in plain sight, it also happened in increments. You had to put the\npieces together to appreciate the magnitude of it. You see, America repudiated\nits president. This, of course, was in response to that pathetic performance\nin the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, Va., when he suggested moral\nequivalence between white supremacists and those who protest them. In\nresponse, America -- a pretty broad swath of it, at least -- has condemned\nhim. The reference is not to the shellacking he took from pundits or the\nreprovals of GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. These things were to\nbe expected. But you did not expect the Chairman and CEO of Merck to quit the\npresident's American Manufacturing Council. And Ken Frazier's departure, which\nhe framed as \"a matter of personal conscience,\" was just the opening salvo. He\nwas followed through the door by members of that panel and others. By week's\nend, two presidential business advisory groups had ceased to exist and plans\nfor a third had been scrapped. Members of the President's Committee on the\nArts and the Humanities also resigned en masse. Meantime, Mar-a-Lago, Trump's\nclub and de facto presidential getaway in Florida, saw a rash of charities\ncanceling their fundraising events. The Washington Post listed the Salvation\nArmy, the American Red Cross, Susan G. Komen and the American Cancer Society\namong those who have chosen to hold their galas elsewhere. And there is yet\nmore. Bob Corker, a respected Republican senator who has heretofore sought to\nengage with the president, raised sharp questions not just about Trump's\ncompetence, but also his \"stability,\" and called for \"radical changes\" in the\nWhite House. Five military chiefs also spoke out against the bigotry in\nCharlottesville, in a striking reproach of their commander. Graduates of\nLiberty University called on fellow alumni to return their diplomas to protest\nLU president Jerry Falwell Jr.'s support for Trump. And it was announced that\nthe president would not be attending the Kennedy Center Honors in December,\nnor host the traditional White House reception for the five honorees after\nthree of them had spoken of boycotting the event. And really: How toxic are\nyou when Lionel Richie doesn't want to shake your hand? It seems that a great\nmany Americans reached a moment of decision and reacted as you would have\nhoped. Trump and his apologists and enablers should take note, because this\ndoes not bode well for them. For all its powers of law making, war making,\nbudget drafting, and diplomacy, the presidency also embodies the power of\nmoral suasion. A president uses what Theodore Roosevelt called \"the bully\npulpit\" -- the honor and prestige of his office -- to stand for what is right\nand remind us to do likewise. Problematically, that office is occupied now by\na man with no moral compass, a man whose only true North is self. So what\nhappened was sadly predictable. What was not predictable was this chorus of\ncastigation from such a wide spectrum of American life. The stunning rebuke\noffers heartening evidence that we have not yet completely abandoned who and\nwhat we are supposed to be. Again, this is a moment of decision. Those who\nchose to separate themselves from Trump declared their values -- and\ncharacter. Those who supported him did, too.\n\n",

Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more\ninformation. [ For the first time ever today two junkboxes messaged the\nTurtleboy business page to ](http://www.attorneygaffney.com/)ask if we had\nXanax for sale.One of them was Jessica Kane, who according to her Facebook\npage lives in Pawtucket, but she insists she lives in Smithfield, RI. Odds are\nshe knows her way around the Bucket though, and could probably tell you which\ncorners yield the highest dividends. Just sayin. Anyway, she reached out to us\nlooking for zannies: But Jessica Kane was just warming up. Because it wasn't\nenough to message a blog that frequently shames junkboxes and ratchets,\nlooking for drugs, she had to take on turtle riders too……. \"I'll beat ur ass\ncorn.\" That's a new one. As you can see she is alleging that we are the ones\nwho solicited her to see if she wanted to buy drugs off us. Ya got that? This\nis what Turtleboys do every day. We scour the Internet looking for junkboxes\nto sell our excess zannies to. Definitely. Anyway, turns out she doesn't have\na drug problem, her \"job\" just doesn't offer health insurance. Naturally then\nher only recourse was to message Turtleboy and see what he was charging. She\ncan't afford health insurance, but cash money sure ain't a problem: That right\nthere is a lot of mushroom tip participation trophies!! As you can see, she's\nsticking to her story that we messaged her first, which obviously makes TONS\nof sense. She kept posting a screenshot showing what appears to be us\ncontacting her first, asking if she was looking for zannies. She just forgot\nthat in the very blog she was commenting on anyone could clearly see that she\nwas the one who initiated contact: Oops!! After that it was time to bust out\nthe CAPS LOCK!! Thirteen years is a long time to be prescribed Xanax. And by\n\"prescribed\" she means, \"treated Diego to a basket lunch in exchange for\nillegal narcotics.\" Up next was the \"I'll fuck everyone up\" portion of the\nGospel of Ratchet: Yea guys, she's totally not a junkie. She just so happens\nto message random community Facebook pages looking to score drugs. And\noccasionally she gets [busted with crack cocaine](https://patch.com/rhode-\nisland/newport/traffic-stop-leads-to-two-drug-arrests): Besides that she's\ntotally NOT a junkie. But it's all good in the hood because she got that shit\ndismissed!! Therefore she never got caught with crack cocaine. (P.S. turtle\nriders are savage) Next up in the ratchet script was the threat to call the\ncops: So if you're keeping score at home, this woman approached us about\nbuying drugs, admitted to the cops that she did so, and the cops responded by\nturning their focus on cyberbullying. Because NOTHING IS MORE SERIOUS THAN\nCYBERBULLYING, EVEN ADDICTION!! You can't make this stuff up. Only on\nTurtleboy. This is why we are the greatest blog that's ever existed. Good luck\nfinding this sort of entertainment at Barstool. But her story checks out\nbecause her uncle is the chief of police: We just don't know what town he's\nthe chief of police in. Wherever he is, I'm sure her imaginary uncle would be\nthrilled to find his junkie niece name dropping him on Turtleboy. But wait, it\ngets better. Last year she made headlines when she was getting her biweekly\nfree ambulance ride to the ER when she claimed she was abused by one of the\nfirst responders. And in one of the greatest MSM fails of all time, NCB\n\"Investigative\" Team [fell for her act hook, line, and\nsinker](http://turnto10.com/i-team/nbc-10-i-team-exclusive-alleged-ambulance-\nassault-caught-on-camera): That interview was amazing. She literally puts on a\nblazer and some non-prescription glasses and the schmucks on this \"I-Team\"\njust assume she's a law-abiding non-ratchet member of society. A local woman\nturned to the NBC 10 I-Team for answers after she captured a confrontation\ninside a North Providence ambulance on cell phone video. The video shows an\nEMT lashing out at her, appearing to slap her in the face and swearing at her\nseveral times. \"He then smacked me across my face,\" Jessica Kane said of the\nJuly 30 incident. North Providence officers were responding to a domestic\ndisturbance call when they came into contact with Kane, who is epileptic. A\npolice report obtained by NBC 10 shows the officers saw her have a seizure and\nlose consciousness. They called the North Providence Fire Department for\nmedical aid, and an ambulance arrived a short time later. \"As soon as I was\nput into the rescue, I was called a drug addict, which I am not,\" she said. \"I\nwas just belittled so much. It made me feel like the people here to treat me\nwere there to just accuse me.\" Oh yea, she's TOTALLY not a drug addict. She's\njust been arrested for crack cocaine and messages random Facebook pages with\n99,000 followers to see if they can sell her Xanax. Oh, and her raspy \"life\nkicked the shit out of me and I'm only 26\" voice wasn't a dead giveaway or\nanything like that. The video shows the EMT appear to slap Kane in the face,\ncausing her to drop her phone. \"That's assault!\" she screams on the tape.\n\"I'll give you assault!\" the man responds. Watch the video if you haven't\nalready. She's all fucked up and aggressive and is taping the guy who probably\nknows her middle name, date of birth, and blood type because he deals with her\nso often. She won't shut the fuck up and approaches him while taping. She gets\ntoo close. He pushes her away from him. Assault. That's how stupid the NBC 10\n\"I-Team\" is. The unidentified EMT can also be heard telling Kane to \"shut the\n(expletive) up.\" She said the verbal abuse continued once she arrived at the\nhospital, moments not captured in the video. \"He said, 'If you don't get the F\nup off this stretcher, I'm going to rip you by your hair,'\" Kane told NBC 10.\nFunny that none of that is on the tape. Guess we'll just have to take this\ncrackbunny's word for it. NBC 10 also reviewed the police report from officers\nwho arrived that day. They noted that Kane was difficult to deal with, writing\nthat, \"Jessica was yelling and screaming in the middle of the road\" and was\n\"extremely belligerent.\" The police report continues, saying that Kane \"became\nhostile, trying to unbuckle herself and get off the stretcher.\" Boom. Mystery\nsolved. Kane was released after spending about five hours at Fatima Hospital,\nand her cell phone was returned. That's when she said she found the video she\nrecorded in the ambulance in her iPhone's \"Recently Deleted\" folder. She\nbelieves someone tried to erase it while the phone was out of her control. \"I\nactually received my phone back and I saw that they tried to delete the\nvideo,\" she said. Oh yea, I'm sure that's what happened. Why would she lie?\nShe's wearing a blazer and glasses!! Kane hired an attorney and said she plans\nto file an assault complaint with Rhode Island State Police. As of Wednesday,\nstate police said they had not yet received the complaint or been contacted by\nKane about the incident. Translation - she called up Dick N. Vulva, never paid\nhim, got high, and never followed through with her massive lawsuit. Anyway, we\nwere still confused how the hell Jessica Kane got the impression that we were\nzanny salesmen. Turns out there was a whole background story: You can't make\nthis shit up. In August we blogged about this Lawrence ghettopoon selling\nXanax on Facebook: Evidently Jessica Kane read the headline of this blog,\nassumed that we were the ones selling zannies, waited until she got her check\non the first of the month, and then hit us up for the hookup. Just another day\nat Turtleboy. Shit like this never gets old. I love my job way too much. One\nguy suggested that it was a slow week: Dude, not one, but two junkbunnies\nmessaged us assuming we sell Xanax from our Facebook page. If you don't think\nthat's getting blogged about then you don't know Turtleboy. Exactly!! Someone\ngets it! From now on I think this is what you people should start doing:\nBrilliant.

            "input": "Methinks she doth protest too much -- and too late. Those who condemned\nPresident Trump for not condemning white supremacist groups quickly and\nforcefully enough after Charlottesville have no problem with Hillary Clinton\ntaking five full days to hypocritically condemn sexual predator Harvey\nWeinstein. Maybe she was pondering the similarities between Weinstein's\npredatory activities and that of her husband. Both used their positions of\npower to extort sexual favors, sometimes forcibly, from women. And just as\nHollywood looked the other way for the sake of career advancement so too did\nHillary Clinton as she rode her husband's attained coattails to political\nprominence. So her [recent expression of\ndisgust](https://www.redstate.com/streiff/2017/10/10/hillary-clinton-totally-\nshocked-harvey-weinstein-lot-like-bill-clinton/) over Weinstein's activities\nring hollow: At long last, the people who do the strategic planning for\nHillary Clinton and tell her what emotions she should imitate in response to\nvarious stimuli have weighed in and they have decided that Harvey Weinstein is\nnot a nice man: \"I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey\nWeinstein. The behavior described by the women coming forward cannot be\ntolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to\nstop this kind of behavior...\" Hillary Clinton knew who and what Weinstein was\nas surely as she knew and knows what Bill Clinton is. Weinstein has been\njoined at the hip with the Clintons for a couple of decades… Ironically, as it\nturns out, he was a major defender of Bill Clinton in the Lewinski affair\nthough Weinstein seemed to favor aiming at the ficus bushes rather than blue\ndresses. At the same time, mind you, that Hillary Clinton was active in\ndirecting a campaign to paint the battalion of women who had been sexually\nassaulted by Bill Clinton as morally decrepit if not outright crazy. Between\nHillary's campaigns and the Clinton Foundation (out of curiosity, is the FBI\nstill investigating this?) she has benefited from as much as a quarter million\ndollars from Weinstein. Hollywood was a major funder of both the Clinton and\nObama political machines, and many a Hollywood star defended Bill Clinton's\nsordid activities as a personal matter as long as he was doing a good job as\nPresident. They similarly defended Weinstein as Michelle Obama once did, as a\n\"wonderful human being\", as well as \"a good friend and just a powerhouse\" Both\nthe Obamas and Clintons knew Weinstein well and [neither should be given a\npass](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/10/12/cnn-jeffrey-toobin-\nobamas-clintons-dont-get-pass-on-weinstein-dark-mark-on-their-record/) for\nfeigning ignorance and shock at his activities: None other than CNN legal\nanalyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Tuesday evening that former President Bill\nClinton and Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and Michelle\nObama should not get a \"pass\" on Harvey Weinstein. In fact, Toobin said their\nassociation with Weinstein throughout the years is a \"dark mark on their\nrecord.\" \"I don't think we can give the Clintons and the Obamas a pass here,\"\nToobin said on Anderson Cooper 360. He cited Seth MacFarlane's creepy joke\nabout Weinstein at an Oscars event and added that MacFarlane's joke\nillustrated that \"a lot of people knew or had very strong suspicions that this\nwas a very bad guy.\" \"The Obamas and the Clintons embraced him, did\nfundraisers with him, paid tribute to him,\" Toobin continued. \"I think it's a\ndark mark on their record…\" The Obamas also finally said on record that they\nwere \"disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein.\" \"Michelle and I\nhave been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein,\" the Obamas\nsaid in a statement. \"Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion\nneeds to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We\nshould celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these\npainful stories. And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering\nour girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such\nbehavior less prevalent in the future…\" As Breitbart News has reported,\nWeinstein visited the Obama White House on at least 13 occasions and Obama's\ndaughter, Malia Obama, \"recently wrapped up an internship at the New York City\noffices of The Weinstein Co.\" Right. Perhaps Weinstein wanted to see where\nBill Clinton dropped his cigar in the Oval Office. Hillary, of course, should\nbe all too familiar with Harvey Weinstein's despicable behavior. She watched\nher husband do the same and worse for decades as she also allegedly fought for\nwomen's rights, except for the right of their victims to leave the room\nunmolested. Hillary famously said that all claims of rape, abuse, and\nharassment should be deemed credible and be believed until proven otherwise.\nIt seems there was an exception for her husband, an exception required by her\nneed to ride his coattails to power, just as Hollywood excused Weinstein\nbecause he could advance or kill the careers of those he exploited. Gennifer\nFlowers, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey as well as, some would\nsuggest, a cast of thousands, have been groped, fondled, and used as sexual\nobjects by one William Jefferson Clinton. Was Hillary appalled and shocked at\nher husband's predatory activities or did she blame it on that \"vast right-\nwing conspiracy\"? And then there's Juanita Broaddrick, who has accused\nPresident Clinton of rape. Juanita Broaddrick's story is a credible one, and\none of the many \" [bimbo eruptions](http://www.westernjournalism.com/here-are-\nthe-top-5-reasons-hillary-clinton-is-anti-woman/)\" that Democratic\npresidential candidate Hillary Clinton handled during her husband Bill's\npresidential campaign As Linda Tripp, confidante of former Clinton intern\nMonica Lewinsky, [told the Daily\nMail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3176621/Lies-cover-ups-\ncorruption-Linda-Tripp-West-Wing-assistant-outed-Monica-Lewinsky-s-sexual-\nliaison-Bill-Clinton-talks-time-Hillary-tells-never-President.html) of how\nHillary both enabled and covered up Bill's many dalliances: Tripp said: 'His\npolitical success was largely dependent upon Hillary. He owed her a great\ndeal. As is widely acknowledged, Hillary took care of all the 'bimbo\neruptions' of which there were thousands in order to present to the world an\nelectable candidate. 'In this endeavor she was ruthless. She destroyed women\nso that their stories never saw the light of day.' So much for fighting for\nwomen's rights. At a Trump press conference in 2016, Broaddrick, tired of\nbeing accused of being part of that vast right-wing conspiracy, and afraid\nthat her attacker would once again occupy the White House with the woman who\norchestrated the attacks on Bill Clinton's \"bimbo eruptions\", [repeated her\naccusation](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/09/trump-holds-press-\nconference-with-women-whove-accused-bill-clinton-sex-assault-rape.html):\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" Broaddrick said. \"Mr. Trump may have said\nsome bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I\ndon't think there's any comparison.\" Broaddrick, who has said Hillary\nthreatened her, appeared with fellow Clinton sexual assault victims Paula\nJones and Kathleen Willey appeared in an interview at presidential suite of\nthe historic Watergate and [related the\ntale](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/09/juanita-\nbroaddrick-kathleen-willey-paula-jones-bill-clinton-sexual-assault/)of Bill's\nassaults and their fear of Hillary's retaliation: In an exclusive [video\ninterview](https://youtu.be/NvoRcPXURwg) at the presidential suite of the\nhistoric Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault\n-- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones -- got together for\nthe first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton and\nto warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women's issues.. The three\nwomen, who say their lives were forever changed by their experiences with the\nClintons, used words like \"terrified\" and \"frightened\" to describe their\nfeelings about the prospects of a Hillary Clinton presidency… \"We were not\nwilling participants,\" Broaddrick said. \"These were crimes.\" In a separate\ninterview, Broaddrick shared her own story of brutal sexual assault which she\nsays Bill Clinton perpetrated against her. Willey called out NBC News' Andrea\nMitchell and CNN's Jake Tapper by name, challenging them: \"These are not\ninfidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people\nwould be in jail… \"This is no longer about infidelities, indiscretions,\ngirlfriends, sex, interns -- none of those. This is about a serial rapist, a\npredator, and his wife who has enabled his behavior all of these years.\" Later\nin this interview, Jones, Willey, and Broaddrick expressed fear at how a\npotential President Hillary Clinton would use the power of her office. \"It\nterrifies me and it should terrify all women,\" Jones stated about Hillary's\npresidential ambitions. \"It should terrify all men and women,\" Willey added.\n\"She will annihilate any enemy. All of her enemies. Anybody who has spoken\nagainst her. Across the board for I don't know how many years. She will get\nrid of them.\" \"No woman who advocates for women attacks the victims of sexual\nassault be it by her husband or anybody else,\" said Willey. The women argued\nthat the term \"enabler\" best describes Hillary Clinton's role in her husband's\nalleged sexual crimes. Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton - sexual predators\nseparated at birth. Hillary and Hollywood knew them and their activities full\nwell and tolerated them for similar reasons. We should be appalled, if not\nshocked, at their craven hypocrisy as both have waged a sick and depraved and\nvery real war on women.

At this point, he's alienated a\ngood percentage of his own party. No need to regurgitate the stream of\nofficials he's fired or who've walked away from his administration. No need to\nreplay senior members of his own party denouncing his behavior. It's become\nglaringly obvious: this guy is about one thing, and that is being the stand-in\nfor a basket of American's once labeled \"deplorables\". While this sounds like\na petty insult, the polls have been consistent: [approximately 1/3rd of\nAmericans have deplorable views about black people, people of color, LGBT, and\nimmigrants.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-race/exclusive-\ntrump-supporters-more-likely-to-view-blacks-negatively-reuters-ipsos-poll-\nidUSKCN0ZE2SW) They are overwhelmingly white, and while they are not all Trump\nsupporters, ALL Trump supporters are in this demographic. This is his base.\nTrump has responded by making every single decision he can to appease and\nplease them. Nothing offended them worse than Barack Obama in the White House.\nAs such, he's dedicated his entire term to doing nothing other than wiping\nObama's name from the annals of American history. The only problem (for him)\nis, he's actually done the reverse. Initially, it appeared that approximately\n45% of the country was in his camp. This was alarming and deeply distressing\nfor those who held President Obama as a champion of the environment, of civil\nrights reforms, and the people. President Obama's grace and personal skills\nhelped pave the way for a global relationship with the rest of the world. That\nmade many of us feel safer. In just 9 months, Trump has managed to alienate\nour closest allies, and wall the USA off from much of the world. We look in\nthe mirror and find ourselves facing a toddler-like madman lobbing hydrogen\nbombs at us. Kim Jong Un is the perfect shadow reflection for Trump who claims\nto be the \"great negotiator\" who's going to make \"great deals\" all over the\nworld. So far, he's been successful at one thing: [rolling back approximately\n800 of Obama deals, mostly concerning the environment, civil rights, and\nimmigration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-\nadministration-cancels-hundreds-of-obama-era-\nregulations/2017/07/20/55f501cc-6d68-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.c49092273580).\nLook forward: 100 years from now, historians will look back to this era as the\nturning of the tide in American culture and politics. Trump's name will\nforever be etched in the books as the provocative agitator who turned America\non its head. For all his publicity stunts and lust for fame, he probably\ndidn't think it would go this way. Because of his monumental effort to white-\nout Obama's name from history, it will forever be impossible to mention Trump\nwithout talking about Barack Obama. History will show that trump would never\nhave been possible if not for President Obama. Van Jones called it \"white\nlash\". It's a rebound reaction from a white demographic entirely uncomfortable\nwith the idea of a progressive black man in the White House. To make matters\nworse, Obama's a far more dignified, intelligent, and graceful man than most\nof us can ever hope to be. Who else could have enraged white supremacists this\nmuch? And who other than Trump could have emboldened them enough to take their\nhoods off and show their faces, marching while shouting racists chants with\nsuch shameless bravado? There are no more sacred cows. When he cut funding to\nMeals on Wheels, most of us thought, huh? What's wrong with you? Then it was\nschool lunches for children, which prompted Michelle Obama to twist up her\nface (very un-Beyonce like) and say, \"what's wrong with you?\" Now comes DACA\nand the whole world screws up its face and shouts, \"WTF is wrong with you???\"\nHere's what's wrong with him: there is a tiny fragment of our society that\napplauds this sort of attitude, and he is a slave to applause. Speaking of\nslaves, these are the same people who, [when polled said they thought slaves\nshould never have been freed](http://time.com/4236640/donald-trump-racist-\nsupporters/). The same people when\n[polled](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/08/trump_s_bigoted_base_by_the_numbers.html)\nsaid they thought white supremacists and Neo Nazis were being marginalized\nmore than people of color. The same people who think [the media is a bigger\nthreat to democracy](https://www.newsmax.com/US/gop-voters-media-white-\nsupremacists/2017/08/30/id/810796/) than white supremacists. These are the\npeople Trump is playing to. As such, whenever he's under fire - which is often\n- he goes on the campaign trail and holds a MAGA rally, where he (in the words\nof John McCain) \"fires up the crazies\". This is the demographic who hold his\nbase intact, and according to polls [should he alienate them, his approval\nratings dip into the single\ndigits.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/08/trump_s_bigoted_base_by_the_numbers.html)\nTrump and his tiny base have one agenda: to wipe Obama's name from the books.\nUnfortunately for him, in the years to come, his name will stand in the shadow\nof Obama as historians will establish comparisons that will have Trump turning\nin his gold plated grave. Thanks to Trump, by comparison, President Obama will\nbe seen as a great visionary of supernatural eloquence and character. Trump's\nlegacy will be pitifully tarnished as the president who did nothing but roll\nback Obama's reforms. He will be forever known as the president who stood for\nnothing more than giving a middle finger to President Obama. All to appease a\nracist, small minded base standing on their last quivering leg. They've found\ntheir hero, the archetypal symbol of white supremacy in Donald Trump. In 100\nyears, when history looks back, it will be Donald Trump's anti-legacy that\nwill give torque to Obama's legacy. No matter how many Obama regulations and\nlaws Trump rolls back, whether it be the Paris Accord or Cuba or DACA, history\nwill cast a glorious light on Obama. Much of this will we can owe to the\nspotlight Trump gave him. We will recognize that this dark era is the result\nof a progressive black man and his family coming to power, agitating the\nshadow of racism and white supremacy in America. Because of him, the rising up\nof this ugly shadow that we now see so clearly is firmly in our collective\ncross hairs. In 100 years, we will give thanks for Donald J. Trump for making\nthe target so big and easy to hit. We'll be grateful for how simple he made it\nfor us to see our disease. We will thank him for ushering in a new dream\nbecause we were finally able to cut the illness out and begin our healing.\nThanks to Donald Trump, we'll be able to see Barack Obama for the great man\nthat he was, and we'll build a monument to him upon the failures of Trump and\nhis ilk.

Were Germany asked to participate, the chancellor warned, she\nwould say yes \"immediately.\" This is a devilish demarche, coming, as it does,\nat a time when the American administration is seeking to demonstrate its\nresolve against North Korea's atomic bomb program. Frau Merkel's interview is\ncalculated to short-circuit any refusal on President Trump's part to certify\nTehran's compliance with the Obama-Khomeini pact. It is dog-whistling to the\nNew York Times, which is no doubt scrambling to get aboard the Merkel\nappeasement. Let's see if it can bring aboard Mr. Trump's newest pal, Senator\nSchumer. New York's senior senator, now the minority leader, played a double\nrole in the drama on the Iran appeasement. Ostensibly he opposed the pact. Yet\nhe refused to take a leading role in the fight against it, even when opponents\nsought to have have the pact itself put to a proper vote. In other words, he\ntook a powder. That was all the more disappointing because it was clear that\nif the pact had been put to the Senate it would have been rejected. This point\nis acknowledged even by the Times, which concedes that the Iran pact was\nopposed in the Congress \"overwhelmingly.\" The Gray Lady suggests that \"many\ncritics now see its value,\" though its editorial fails to name any such\ncritics. Germany, of course, never gave a fig about what the Congress thought\nof the pact. And why should it have? The Obama administration took the\nunratified deal straight to the United Nations, where Ambassador Power voted\nagainst the Congress of her own country. \"It's presumptuous of some people to\nsuspect that France, Russia, China, Germany, Britain ought to do what the\nCongress tells them to do,\" Secretary of State Kerry snickered. President\nPutin must have loved that line. Frau Merkel, in any event, isn't waiting for\nany formal nod in respect of what President Trump wants to do about the Iran\ndeal -- or about North Korea. She's prepared to leap right into a negotiated\nsettlement with Pyongyang that would, if Iran is any guide, leave its\ncommunist camarilla not only entrenched but richer to boot. This is a moment\nfor President Trump to remember the 30 American states that lofted him to\noffice. The platform on which he stood described the Iran deal as a \"personal\nagreement\" between President Obama and his negotiating partners. It described\nit as \"non-binding on the next president.\" Mr. Trump himself promised to \"rip\nup\" the agreement. That he has grounds to do so was underscored last week at\nWashington by his envoy at the United Nations, Governor Haley. She is a better\ntribune of American interests than Chancellor Merkel. receive the latest by\nemail: subscribe to the new york sun's free mailing list\n\n",

            "input": "Days after Steven Bannon's blustery, accusatory interview on \"60 Minutes,\" in\nwhich he warned the apostates blocking President Trump's agenda that he's\ncoming after them, Trump confirmed it -- there is no such thing as Trumpism.\nIn recent weeks he's assured Democrats he backs legalizing the Dreamers,\naffirmed a commitment to foreign aid in front of the United Nations, and said\nhe's adding troops in Afghanistan. Will Trump now accept \"better\" terms he\nwants in the Paris climate accord? Too bad for Bannon, because none of this is\nremotely the fault of his favorite punching bags, Senate Minority Leader Mitch\nMcConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, just Trump himself. Bannon's new self-\ndescribed role as \"wingman\" growling from outside instead of inside the White\nHouse -- where as chief strategist he fought openly against the \"globalist\"\nforces he believed included Trump's family members -- isn't going very well.\nTrump keeps screwing things up for the Breitbart News commander. After getting\nfired last month he lamented to the Weekly Standard that \"the Trump presidency\nthat we fought for, and won, is over.\" But upon reflection, Bannon realized\nthat lame duck talk diminishes his own power, so he's in overdrive fighting\nfor scraps of a policy vision the president embraces spasmodically. Bannon\nsays he's enjoying having \"my hands back on my weapons,\" but he's outside\nlooking in at a West Wing filled with elites from Goldman Sachs -- the very\ndefinition of \"the swamp\" that Bannon is always frothing about. There, a\npresident is spending political donations on legal fees while his staffers go\ndeep in debt with mounting lawyer bills, visitor logs are kept secret so\nvoters have no idea who is permitted into the Oval Office to influence the\npresident, and a kleptocracy thrives where Trump and his children continue to\nbe enriched by business connected to foreign governments, including the\nChinese. Cabinet secretaries are using government planes for private use and\nprivate planes for government work -- violations that would have sparked\nendless Breitbart bonfires under President Obama. In reality, however, there\nwas little left of Trumpism to trumpet even before Bannon was fired. He's got\nthe travel ban (or at least a modified version of it), and maybe the promised\nwithdrawal from the Paris climate agreement; Bannon will claim credit if Trump\npulls out of the Iran nuclear deal -- but that's about it. On trade and\nimmigration, the president has retreated from Bannon's barricade-crashing\nproposals and has not withdrawn from NAFTA, not imposed tariffs on Chinese\nsteel imports, has three times backed off threats over funding for a border\nwall and now come out in favor of what Bannon calls \"amnesty.\" Yet Bannon has\ndeclared war, promising to take out incumbent Republican senators who aren't\nsufficiently loyal to the president. Targets are guilty of insufficient fealty\nto Trump himself, not to an agenda once thought of as Trumpism. With the\nbacking of loyal mega-donor Robert Mercer, the Bannon forces are targeting\nSen. Jeff Flake, and potentially Sens. Bob Corker and Roger Wicker as well.\nGOP leaders are incensed over the millions more they will spend protecting\nthose lawmakers, money that could be spent trying to knock off Democrats.\nCurrently Bannon is working to elect Roy Moore to replace sitting Sen. Luther\nStrange in the Alabama Senate race. Trump has endorsed Strange, also backed by\nMcConnell. Bannon is backing the more Trumpian candidate and, well, Trump is\nnot. Bannon, ironically, purports to be interested in protecting GOP\nmajorities in Congress. Before he could imagine Trump giving away the store on\nDACA to Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Bannon declared in\nhis \"60 Minutes\" interview that preserving President Obama's executive order\nwould cause a GOP civil war. He expects Dreamers to run out their permits and\n\"self-deport,\" because \"amnesty is non-negotiable.\" He also said, \"I'm worried\nabout losing the House now because of this,\" adding that his fear is \"in\nFebruary and March it will be a civil war inside the Republican Party.\" But if\ncivil war in the GOP isn't Bannon's aim, it's hard to know what is. He blames\neverything on Ryan and McConnell. \"They do not want Donald Trump's populist\neconomic agenda to be implemented. It's very obvious. It's obvious as night\nfollows day,\" he told Charlie Rose. In the name of Trumpism, Bannon swallows\nheavy doses of denial. After all, when Trump threatened to withdraw from\nNAFTA, the president's kids and other aides made calls to the Canadian\ngovernment and arranged for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to call Trump and\ntalk him off the ledge. It wasn't Ryan or McConnell. Trump's approval ratings\nremain low, Bannon said, \"because he hasn't -- we haven't gotten the wall\nbuilt.\" Earth to Steve: Trump has signaled to Congress the wall is a joke. In\nthe wake of the DACA debacle, Breitbart called the president \"Amnesty Don,\"\nyet Bannon himself has stayed sheepishly silent. Ann Coulter, author of \"In\nTrump We Trust,\" tweeted: \"Looks like Bannon got it wrong. That shadowy force\ntrying to nullify the 2016 election ... is\n[@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump).\" Rep. Steve King told\nthe Associated Press the president was destroying his support by betraying his\ncampaign promise, and that his base is \"irreparable, disillusioned beyond\nrepair.\" King added, \"No promise is credible.\" Sam Nunberg, a close Bannonite,\nconceded: \"The reality is sinking in that the Trump administration is on the\nprecipice of turning into an establishment presidency.\" But Bannon isn't just\nbreaking plates at Breitbart, he's building his own brand. Last week, like any\nother dime-a-dozen elitist, Bannon attended an investor conference in Hong\nKong. He told the exclusive gathering he speaks to Trump every two-to-three\ndays, despite White House denials that the president has spoken more than once\nwith Bannon since he left. Before Trump disappointed him on DACA, Nunberg had\nhailed Bannon's increased influence with Trump. \"I think Steve leaves and a\nweek later he [Trump] pardons Arpaio and they suspend DACA. I don't think\nthere was any coincidence there,\" Nunberg told BuzzFeed. Bannon remains\nfixated on the threat China poses to the United States, has grimly predicted\nwe will be at war with that nation within five-to-10 years over its buildup of\nmilitary installations in the South China Sea, and said we're already \"at\neconomic war\" with China. Yet his domestic bark in this regard doesn't seem to\nbe the same as his overseas-investor-conference bite. Once there, the New York\nTimes described Bannon as \"more subdued about the purported Chinese threat.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal reported he described Trump's great respect for\nPresident Xi and prospects for trade, but that \"the U.S. needs to play a\nstronger role in changing the system in China, an attendee recalled.\" It's a\nfar cry from a trade war on steel. Perhaps over time, Bannonism will go the\nway of Trumpism. A.B. Stoddard is associate editor of RealClearPolitics and a\ncolumnist.

We accept her apology,\" they wrote.\nESPN has been under intense scrutiny after they pulled their broadcaster\nRobert Lee off air \"as the tragic events in Charlottesville were unfolding\" in\nAugust. The Associated Press contributed to this report. White House Press\nSecretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is calling for the termination of an ESPN\nanchor after she called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter.\n\"That is one of the more outrageous comments that anybody could make and\ncertainly is something that is a fireable offense by ESPN,\" Sanders said on\nWednesday. This comes after Jemele Hill, who co-hosts a ESPN show called \"SC6\nwith Michael and Jemele,\" fired off a series of Tweets denouncing Trump and\ncalling his supporters white supremacists. EPSN soon issued a statement in\nresponse to Smith's remarks. \"The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill\nregarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN,\" the network\nsaid. \"We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were\ninappropriate.\" ESPN on Tuesday distanced itself from anchor Jemele Hill's\ntweets calling President Trump \"a bigot\" and \"a white supremacist.\" \"The\ncomments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent\nthe position of ESPN,\" the network tweeted from its public relation's\ndepartment's account. \"We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes\nher actions were inappropriate,\" ESPN added of Hill, a co-host on the 6 p.m.\nbroadcast of the network's \"SportsCenter\" program. Hill on Monday had a series\nof Twitter exchanges with other users that involved her harshly criticizing\nTrump. \"Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself\nw/other white supremacists,\" she said in one tweet. \"Trump is the most\nignorant, offensive president of my lifetime,\" Hill added in another post.\n\"His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.\" Hill added in a\nthird tweet that \"Donald Trump is a bigot\" before going on to deride the\npresident's supporters. \"The height of white privilege is being able to ignore\nhis white supremacy, because it's of no threat to you,\" she said. \"Well, it's\na threat to me.\" Some Twitter users on Wednesday praised Hill for singling out\nTrump, while others lambasted her decision instead. ESPN is owned by Disney,\nand neither company elaborated on a possible punishment for Hill, who was on\nTuesday night's broadcast of \"SportsCenter\" like normal.

Kaepernick remains unsigned after playing\nwith the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2016 in a situation that remains\ncontroversial in the football world. The professional athlete began kneeling\nduring the National Anthem last year to protest police brutality and racial\ninjustice.

He is single-handedly destroying the Republican Party, trashing\npresidential debates and spoiling the reputation of locker-room talk. And --\nbreaking news alert! -- Trump is even changing journalism. His habit of saying\nthings that nobody ever said before is forcing reporters to unleash their\npartisan views instead of just giving the facts. Some of these charges may be\ntrue, but the one about Trump changing journalism is demonstrably false. All\nthe more so because it comes from the editor of the New York Times, who\nhappens to be the actual guilty party. Dean Baquet, the Gray Lady's boss for\ntwo years, recently claimed that Trump's campaign had forced the paper into a\nnew way of covering politics. \"I think that he's challenged our language,\"\nBaquet [told an interviewer](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/10/the-new-york-\ntimes-dean-baquet-on-calling-out-lies-embracing-video-and-building-a-more-\ndigital-newsroom/). \"He will have changed journalism, he really will have.\"\nThe claim is presented as one of those chin-stroking insights about a new\nparadigm that liberals spot around every corner. In fact, it is just another\nexample of the Times getting it all wrong. Trump didn't change the Times --\nBaquet did. He's the one who authorized reporters to abandon the paper's\nstandards when covering Trump and express their personal political opinions.\nOr, as Baquet said in the [interview with Nieman Lab's Ken\nDoctor](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/10/the-new-york-times-dean-baquet-on-\ncalling-out-lies-embracing-video-and-building-a-more-digital-newsroom/), the\nstruggle for fairness is over. \"I think that Trump has ended that struggle,\"\nBaquet boasted. \"I think we now say stuff. We fact-check him. We write it more\npowerfully that it's false.\" Fact-checking, of course, is often in the eye of\nthe beholder, and quickly morphs into opinion when there is no restraint or\nneutral standard. The result is the paper's relentless, daily assault on\nTrump, to the advantage of Hillary Clinton. Opinions, all uniformly anti-\nTrump, now ooze from the paper's every pore, with headlines on front-page\n\"news\" articles indistinguishable from daily denunciations on the editorial\nand op-ed pages. This is not a mere continuation of the old liberal bias that\ninfected the Times, the Washington Post and the broadcast networks for years.\nThis is a malignant strain of conformity that strips away any pretense of\nfairness in favor of strident partisanship. The signal that the Times\nabandoned its traditional church-state separation of news and opinion came in\nan article by the paper's media reporter two months ago. In [his August\npiece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/business/balance-fairness-and-a-\nproudly-provocative-presidential-candidate.html), Jim Rutenberg declared that\nmost reporters saw Trump \"as an abnormal and potentially dangerous candidate,\"\nand concluded they had a duty to be \"true to the facts, in a way that will\nstand up to history's judgment.\" Baquet, in the interview, cited the Rutenberg\npiece, saying it \"nailed\" his thinking. He also said he started \"down this\ntrack\" years ago, during the dispute over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,\nand made it clear he believed then-President George W. Bush and then-Secretary\nof State Colin Powell lied to take America to war. The Trump treatment, he\nsaid, was a logical extension: \"I think he gave us courage, if you will. I\nthink he made us -- forced us, because he does it so often, to get comfortable\nwith saying something is false.\" This is not a mere continuation of the old\nliberal bias that infected the Times, the Washington Post and the broadcast\nnetworks for years. This is a malignant strain of conformity that strips away\nany pretense of fairness in favor of strident partisanship. Baquet offered\nanother example that got him to this point. He accused Republicans of lying in\ntheir \"swift-boat\" charges against Democratic nominee John Kerry in the 2004\ncampaign. It is not incidental that his examples all involve allegedly\ndishonest Republicans, and none involves dishonest Democrats. Nothing better\nexplains why the Times fails to give Clinton the same scrutiny it gives Trump.\nMore than 60 percent of voters regard her as fundamentally dishonest, but\nBaquet sees only Republicans as liars. Simply put, his political bias\nprecludes fair journalism. And once standards are gone, they are gone forever,\nmeaning anyone wanting to work at the Times will face a political litmus test.\nBaquet's defense of slanted coverage is reflected in the trove of emails\nWikiLeaks released from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Times\nreporters and columnists repeatedly show up in partisan ways. Washington\ncorrespondent John Harwood sends Podesta his private approval of Hillary\nClinton appearances, as if he's on the team. Columnist Nicholas Kristof, in\nadvance of an interview with Bill Clinton, emails his questions, which\nPodesta's team passes around to staffers to shape Clinton's answers. A\nWashington reporter gives Hillary Clinton veto power over quotations he can\nuse from an interview. Another reporter is praised as someone who has \"never\ndisappointed\" in delivering stories the campaign wants \"teed up\" for public\nconsumption. As the editor, Baquet should be outraged that his staff secretly\ncompromised the paper's integrity. But as the editor who eliminated the Times'\nstandards, he's getting the biased paper he wanted. Questions for de Blasio\nMayor Bill de Blasio won't take questions from The Post these days, so here\nare questions all City Hall reporters should insist he answer.  No. 1: Has the\nmayor or his lawyer been informed that de Blasio is a target of federal and\nstate investigations? No. 2: Has the mayor been ordered to testify before a\ngrand jury? Has he voluntarily offered to do so? No. 3: Did the mayor ask\nteachers union president Michael Mulgrew for the $350,000 contribution the\nunion gave to de Blasio's political slush fund, the Campaign for One New York,\na month before the union got a $9 billion contract? No. 4: Did de Blasio or\nhis wife, Chirlane McCray, personally receive any money, gifts or other things\nof significant value from the consultants paid millions of dollars by the\nCampaign for One New York? No. 5: Who is paying the legal fees of de Blasio\nand City Hall aides? How much, if any, taxpayer money has been spent\nrepresenting them? The public has a right to know what the mayor knows about\nthe investigations, including the possibility he will face criminal charges.\nThe reporters in Room 9, the legendary home of the City Hall press corps,\nshould ask these questions every day until they get answers. Hill corruption\nis e-asy to see Reading the emails hacked from John Podesta's account, I felt\nsqueamish. But two facts settled my stomach. First, the emails reveal the\ngreed and backstabbing among the Clinton clan. There is no honor among those\nthieves. Second, the claim that the messages are forged or a Russian plot\nillustrate how the family fudges facts it can't deny. That means the emails\noffer the unvarnished truth, making them unique in Clinton land.  Dem's truth\non voter fraud Alan Schulkin will never eat lunch in New York again. The\nManhattan Democratic representative on the city's Board of Elections was\ncaught telling an inconvenient truth, saying, \"I think there is a lot of voter\nfraud.\" Schulkin was being secretly taped by an undercover journalist, so\nmaybe his party will forgive him for saying what everybody knows to be true.\nOtherwise, he's going to be a very hungry man.\n\n",

He began with his strongest\nargument -- that the political class represented by her has failed us and it's\ntime to look to a successful dealmaker for leadership -- and kept to it pretty\nwell for the first 20 minutes. Then due to the vanity and laziness that led\nhim to think he could wing [the most important 95 minutes of his\nlife](https://thenypost.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/donald-trump-and-hillary-\nclinton-get-vicious-in-first-debate/), he lost the thread of his argument, he\nlost control of his temper and he lost the perspective necessary to correct\nthese mistakes as he went. Methodically and carefully, Hillary Clinton took\nover. Her purpose was to show she was rational and policy-driven, the kind of\nperson who could be trusted to handle a careful and delicate job with prudence\nand sobriety -- and that he was none of these things. And she succeeded. By\nthe end of the 95 minutes, Trump was reduced to a sputtering mess blathering\nabout Rosie O'Donnell and about how he hasn't yet said the mean things about\nHillary that he is thinking. Most important, he set ticking time bombs for\nhimself over the next six weeks. As she hammered him on his tax returns, he\nhanded her an inestimable gift by basically saying he pays no federal taxes\ndespite his billions -- and moreover, that if he had done so, it would have\nbeen \"squandered\" anyway. By the end of the 95 minutes, Trump was reduced to a\nsputtering mess blathering about Rosie O'Donnell and about how he hasn't yet\nsaid the mean things about Hillary that he is thinking. That's not going to go\naway, nor is her suggestion that his refusal to release his returns is the\nresult of his either not being as rich as he says or not being as charitable\nas he claims. Clinton quoted him saying in 2006 that he hoped for a housing\nmeltdown because it would provide buying opportunities and thereby goaded him\ninto saying \"that's called business, by the way.\" To which she quickly replied\nthat 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million lost their homes in the\nhousing meltdown he was so excited about. Blammo. His reply to Hillary's\nrecitation of the fact he'd begun his career settling a Justice Department\nlawsuit about racial discrimination in Trump housing was that there was \"no\nadmission of guilt,\" which is the sort of thing the villain said at the end of\n\"LA Law\" and sounded no better in real life. Even when he could have taken her\ndown, he was so incompetent he didn't go for it. A question about\ncybersecurity was the perfect opportunity to hammer Clinton on her outrageous\nmishandling of classified information. Instead, he went into a bizarre\ndigression in which he alternately wondered whether his son Barron might grow\nup to become a hacker and defended Vladimir Putin from the accusation Russia\nhad tapped into the Democratic National Committee's emails (which the FBI says\nalmost certainly happened). That has to count as the biggest choke of his\npolitical life. By the time the last 15 minutes rolled around, he was reduced\nto yammering about Rosie O'Donnell being mean to him and Hillary running mean\ncommercials about him and praising himself because there are some really\nterrible things he could have said about Hillary but hasn't. By this point,\neven his smart closing zinger -- \"she has experience but it's bad experience\"\n-- was buried inside a weird word salad that reduced its effectiveness to\nalmost nil. His supporters should be furious with him, and so should the\npublic in general. By performing this incompetently, by refusing to prepare\nproperly for this exchange, by not learning enough to put meat on the bones of\nhis populist case against Clinton, he displayed nothing but contempt for the\npeople who have brought him this far -- and for the American people who are\ngoing to make this momentous decision on Nov. 8.\n\n",

            "input": "Few words could be more apposite to the tactics of the Remainers. On Thursday\nmorning, after the High Court ruled that the Government cannot use the Royal\nPrerogative to trigger Article 50, Gina Miller - the woman behind the case -\nstood outside the Royal Courts of Justice and tried to prove Abraham Lincoln\nwrong. With a straight face she said that the case had nothing to do with the\nEU. \"This is about process, not politics.\" And she's not alone. Almost to a\nman and woman the Remainers have told us that all they have been trying to do\nis right a wrong. The High Court ruled that the Government cannot use the\nRoyal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 That it's a simple matter of democracy\nand parliamentary sovereignty being re-established and the fact they are all\nRemainers is irrelevant. They really do think you can fool all of the people\nall of the time. Because in the real world the case was brought by people who\nhad only one motive: to screw up this first stage of Brexit. It had almost\nnothing to do with process and everything to do with politics. And it's not\ngoing to stop here. There is almost nothing the Remainers won't do to try to\nkeep us in. If that means showing contempt towards the result of the\nreferendum - well, they won't bat an eyelid. The entire history of the EU\nshows that whenever a referendum goes against them the Eurofanatics ignore it\nand demand another one. Gina Miller said that the case had nothing to do with\nthe EU Which is of course exactly what some - such as Owen Smith, the Labour\nMP who was beaten out of sight by Jeremy Corbyn this summer - are now saying,\narguing that any deal done by the Government should be subject to another\nreferendum. For others there's no need even to hold a second referendum. They\nwant simply to ignore the referendum and let Parliament put the kybosh on\nBrexit. Most won't admit to this because they know that it's toxic. But some,\nsuch as Labour MP David Lammy, are open about their contempt for the\nelectorate. Mr Lammy said that when Parliament decides on Article 50: \"I will\nbe voting in what I believe to be the interests of the country - which I think\nall MPs will take on board - and will absolutely not be voting to trigger\nArticle 50.\" This is the crux of the matter because the real issue isn't\nwhether or not Parliament should have a vote. The real issue is how Parliament\nwill vote. Be clear about what many of the Remainer MPs want: to stop Brexit.\nAnd remember that a clear majority of MPs backed Remain in June. They speak\nabout parliamentary sovereignty (which, incidentally, can only be\nreestablished if we leave the EU). But that's a fig leaf. What they are really\nconcerned with is finding whatever ways they can to stop Brexit. Let me tell\nyou what is coming next. When MPs have to vote on triggering Article 50 they\nwill come up with some entirely spurious but supposedly democratic reason why\nthey have to vote No. Labour MP David Lammy said he 'will absolutely not be\nvoting to trigger Article 50' It's got nothing to do with not honouring the\nreferendum result, they'll tell us. How could you even think that?! No, it's\nbecause… blah blah blah. On and on it will go. Every time the issue is\ndiscussed they will come up with supposedly plausible reasons to do with\ndemocracy and fairness that mean they have no choice, they'll say, but to vote\nNo. In reality they will have only one motive: stopping Brexit. Their hope and\nplan is that the longer any decisions are delayed the more chance there is of\na change of mood. And they will do their damnedest to create that change of\nmood. So in parallel they will use their powers to try to ensure we have the\nworst possible deal so that they can re-argue the referendum debate when the\ndeal is done. We are seeing this already with Hilary Benn, the Remainer chair\nof the new House of Commons select committee on Brexit, demanding that the\nGovernment reveals its negotiation stance - and so hand a huge advantage to\nBrussels. But they are playing with fire. The will of the people has been\nclearly expressed. The referendum was unambiguous. There is no wriggle room.\nBrexit must mean Brexit. If it doesn't - if Remain MPs use their powers to\nfrustrate the will of the people - then they will provoke one of the greatest\nconstitutional crises since the Civil War. Brexit committee chairman Hilary\nBenn Thu, March 2, 2017 Gina Miller is leading the challenge that has blocked\nTheresa May triggering Article 50 without the consent of Parliament Gina\nMiller has won the case to block Theresa May from Article 50 Parliament will\nbe defying the people over the result of a referendum that Parliament itself\ncalled. But the constitutional crisis may be the least of it. It is a truism\nof modern politics that voters are disengaged - that their faith in the\npolitical class and political institutions is collapsing. In the US that is\nreflected in Donald Trump's ascendancy. In France, Marine Le Pen owes her rise\nto a similar trend. We have a proud tradition that has always pushed\nextremists and rabble-rousers to the edges. If, however, our politicians were\nto show that they do not merely fail to connect with voters but are actively\ncontemptuous of them, it is difficult to see how we could avoid disaster. To\nsay there would be anger would barely come close. Not only would our political\nsystem be on the point of collapse there would be riots. And it would be a\npolitical crisis entirely of the Remainers' making. These are worrying times.\nIt is not just Brexit that is imperilled by their behaviour. It is our entire\npolitical system.\n\n",

            "input": "[ Hillary Clinton called Monica Lewinsky a \"narcissistic loony tune.\" She\ncalled Gennifer Flowers \"some failed cabaret singer.\" She said Republicans in\nCongress had organized \"a vast right-wing conspiracy\" against her husband,\nPresident Bill Clinton. And now the former secretary of state and defeated\nDemocratic presidential candidate says those of us still interested in the\ninvestigating of her conduct are engaging in an \"abuse of power.\" Hillary\nClinton expects special treatment. She always has. The real question is: why\ndid the FBI give it to her? The FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton was\nreferred to as \"special\" in an email sent by current FBI Deputy Director\nAndrew McCabe. He was the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington\nField Office before his promotion to the second-ranking spot in the bureau.\nDespite a deep web of connections to Clinton, McCabe formally recused himself\nfrom the email investigation only a week before the 2016 election. McCabe's\nadmissions are telling, but not inaccurate. Four months have passed since 20\nmembers of the House Judiciary Committee demanded a special counsel to\ninvestigate Hillary Clinton. No action from the Department of Justice has been\ntaken. Only a special person could have her spouse meet with Attorney General\nLoretta Lynch on a tarmac in Phoenix during an ongoing criminal investigation.\nRecently released emails show that Bill Clinton purposely altered his\ndeparture to get time alone with Lynch. While the FBI was very concerned with\npunishing the agent who disclosed the Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting, the\nimpropriety of the gathering garnered far less attention. When Lynch told\nthen-FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Hillary Clinton investigation as\na \"matter\" rather than an \"investigation,\" language had a special meaning.\nAccording to McCabe, \"the decision was made to investigate (Hillary Clinton)\nat HQ with a small team.\" The double standard is glaring. More prosecutors are\ncurrently investigating President Trump than were assigned to the Oklahoma\nCity bombing, but Hillary Clinton got the small team at HQ. And how did the\n\"small team at HQ\" handle the investigation? In a word - special. Somewhere\nbetween the first and the final draft, Comey's statement changed. He first\nwrote that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server was \"grossly\nnegligent.\" The final draft said she was \"extremely careless.\" Comey's\nexoneration was drafted before the FBI interviewed key witnesses - including\nClinton herself. When Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles\nMcCullough confronted officials about the depth of Clinton's crimes, he faced\nthreats and \"personal blowback\" against him and his family. McCullough's\nreports were delivered to then-Director of National Intelligence James\nClapper. Clapper spoke of the \"heartburn\" that exposure would create for\nHillary Clinton's campaign. In every instance, being special has redounded to\nHillary Clinton's political and legal benefit. Not so for President Trump.\nSome at the Department of Justice and the FBI seem to have a special bias\nagainst the president. FBI Agent Peter Strzok sent biased anti-Trump text\nmessages. He worked on both the Clinton email scandal and the Mueller probe.\nIt remains unclear what evidence he reviewed, generated or damaged in either\ninvestigation. Four months have passed since 20 members of the House Judiciary\nCommittee demanded a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton. No action\nfrom the Department of Justice has been taken. As members of the Judiciary\nCommittee, we have demanded an investigation into the FBI's procedures,\npractices, oversight and reporting. If biased agents have tainted evidence, we\nneed to see it. If politically-interested prosecutors have an agenda, we need\nto know it. If our government institutions are being undermined by the deep\nstate, we must expose it. After all, equal treatment under the law is just one\nthing that makes America so special.

YOU are the thin-skinned\nyokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs\nat you (\"deplorables\"), while cheering Trump on as he leaves a bonfire of\ntruly hateful invective everywhere he goes.

            "input": "It has to be admitted that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he was elected\nto do. He was not elected to be a legislative president. He never showed any\nreal interest in policy during the campaign. He was elected to be a cultural\npresident. He was elected to shred the dominant American culture and to give\nvoice to those who felt voiceless in that culture. He's doing that every day.\nWhat's troubling to me is that those who are the targets of his assaults seem\nto have no clue about what is going on. When they feel the most righteous,\nlike this past weekend, they are actually losing and in the most peril. Let me\ntry to explain what I think is happening: After World War II the Protestant\nestablishment dominated the high ground of American culture and politics. That\nestablishment eventually failed. It tolerated segregation and sexism, led the\nnation into war in Vietnam and became stultifying. So in the late 1960s along\ncame a group of provocateurs like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the rest of\nthe counterculture to upend the Protestant establishment. People like Hoffman\nwere buffoons, but also masters of political theater. They never attracted\nmajority support for their antics, but they didn't have to. All they had to do\nwas provoke, offend the crew-cut crowd, generate outrage and set off a cycle\nthat ripped apart the cultural consensus. The late 1960s were a time of\nintense cultural conflict, which left a lot of wreckage in its wake. But\neventually a new establishment came into being, which we will call the\nmeritocratic establishment. These were the tame heirs to Hoffman and Rubin.\nThey were well educated. They cut their moral teeth on the civil rights and\nfeminist movements. They embraced economic, social and moral individualism.\nThey came to dominate the institutions of American society on both left and\nright. Hillary Clinton is part of this more educated cohort. So are parts of\nthe conservative establishment. If you're reading this newspaper, you probably\nare, too, as am I. This establishment, too, has had its failures. It created\nan economy that benefits itself and leaves everybody else out. It led America\ninto war in Iraq and sent the working class off to fight it. It has developed\nits own brand of cultural snobbery. Its media, film and music industries make\nmembers of the working class feel invisible and disrespected. So in 2016,\nmembers of the outraged working class elected their own Abbie Hoffman as\npresident. Trump is not good at much, but he is wickedly good at sticking his\nthumb in the eye of the educated elites. He doesn't have to build a new\nculture, or even attract a majority. He just has to tear down the old one.\nThat's exactly what he's doing. Donald Trump came into a segmenting culture\nand he is further tearing apart every fissure. He has a nose for every wound\nin the body politic and day after day he sticks a red-hot poker in one wound\nor another and rips it open. Day by day Trump is turning us into a nation of\ndifferent planets. Each planet feels more righteous about itself and is more\nisolated from and offended by the other planets. The members of the educated\nclass saw this past weekend's NFL fracas as a fight over racism. They felt\nmobilized and unified in that fight and full of righteous energy. Members of\nthe working class saw the fracas as a fight about American identity. They saw\nPittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin try to dissuade Alejandro Villanueva, a\nthree-time combat veteran, from celebrating the flag he risked his life for.\nMembers of this class also felt mobilized, unified and full of righteous\nenergy. I don't know which planet is bigger, or which would win an election,\nbut that frankly doesn't matter. All that matters is that Trump is shredding\nthe culture and ending the dominance of the meritocratic establishment. He\ncontinually goes after racial matters in part because he's a bigot but also in\npart because multiculturalism is the theology of the educated class and it's\nthe leverage point he can most effectively use to isolate the educated class\nfrom everyone else. He is so destructive because his enemies help him. He\nramps up the aggression. His enemies ramp it up more, to preserve their own\ndignity. But the ensuing cultural violence only serves Trump's long-term\ndestructive purpose. America is seeing nearly as much cultural conflict as it\ndid in the late 1960s. It's quite possible that after four years of this Trump\nwill have effectively destroyed the prevailing culture. The reign of the\nmeritocratic establishment will be just as over as the reign of the Protestant\nestablishment now is. Of course Donald Trump is a buffoon. Buffoonery is his\nmost effective weapon. Because of him, a new culture will have to be built,\nnew values promulgated and a new social fabric will have to be woven, one that\nbrings the different planets back into relation with one another. That's the\nwork of the next 20 years.\n\n",

            "input": "\"They've forgotten about us.\" I don't remember where I heard this, perhaps\nsomewhere in the small town of Blacksburg, Virginia, but the context was\ndefinitely political. The IRS is always out to get our money - of course the\ngovernment hasn't forgotten about us, right? But the more I thought about it,\nthe more I realized the meaning behind that statement. Since the founding days\nof the United States, a problem has always been the power balance between\nsmall states and big states. Presently, this has evolved into the local\nbalance between rural areas and urban areas. I remember hearing in government\nclass how just a dozen or so of the largest cities in the United States could\nswing the popular vote to one political party and realizing just how valuable\nthe electoral college is to modern politics. There's no simple alternative to\nbalancing out protecting the interests of the rural minority and forwarding\nthose of the urban majority. From [the U.S.\nCensus](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-210.html):\n\"Rural areas cover 97 percent of the nation's land area but contain 19.3\npercent of the population.\" This is a huge disparity; how can state\ngovernments look out for rural counties when urban counties dominate the\npolitical sphere? For many in southwestern Virginia, it seems that politicians\nare always subverting rural interests in favor of the dense, northern urban\nareas. Even the President and many other conservatives use this idea of rural\nareas being left out to win votes. From his always-rambunctious Twitter\naccount, Trump proclaimed: \"The Democrats in the Southwest part of Virginia\nhave been abandoned by their Party. Republican Ed Gillespie will never let you\ndown!\" In a time of great change and technology around the globe, sometimes it\ncan feel as if rural areas are being left behind. Given this context, I'd like\nto quickly transition to a discussion about the political frustrations\nsurrounding the Confederate flag. The Civil War was definitely fought over\nslavery, but does that make the Confederate flag racist? Probably. But I'd\nalso like to consider what the Confederate flag symbolizes to many in the\nSouth. Growing up, Confederate flags were never really made out to be a big\ndeal. I remember thinking nothing of the raised Confederate flags on the way\nto swim meets and camps. I remember the public outcry throughout the region\nwhen the school sent out an announcement banning Confederate attire. Even\nrecently, right before I came to Stanford, I was driving home one night and\npulled up next to a beat-up pickup truck flying two large Confederate flags at\na traffic light. It felt pretty normal, albeit a little strange especially\nbecause of the [earlier South Carolina flag\ncontroversy](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/02/politics/confederate-flag-poll-\nracism-southern-pride/index.html) and [the happenings in\nCharlottesville](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/14/us/charlottesville-rally-\ntimeline-tick-tock/index.html). This was the norm. The problem is just how\ncommonplace these provocative items are in the region. These rural\nSoutherners, a legislative minority, are painted as villains, outcasts for not\nseeing these items as strange in such an apparently \"progressive\" society.\nThis is an issue because first off, no one likes being called a villain, and\nsecondly, to many of these people - who have seen crumbling infrastructure, a\nstagnating economy and skyrocketing health care premiums (one of my older\nteachers always complained about his wife's new insurance bill under\nObamacare) - are we really that progressive? And how high should working out\nour flag issues be on our priorities list? Should we be arguing over a flag\nwhen there are places with exactly zero professional medical attention? I\nremember watching the local news and finding out that in nearby Wise County,\nVirginia, the only time people can receive medical attention is once a year,\nwhen a mobile clinic known as the [Remove Area\nMedical](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/us/healthcare-uninsured-rural-\npoor-affordable-care-act-republicans.html) arrives. General health is\ndeteriorating every year as lung cancer and obesity set in. Things really\naren't looking up for the people here. The fact that a colored piece of cloth\nis generating the most media coverage instead of a terrible healthcare crisis\nhere is a sort of a slap in the face to the coal miner with permanent nerve\ndamage or the diabetic who can't access insulin. We tend to separate the world\ninto \"us\" and the \"other,\" but we fail to realize that the \"other\" may also be\nstruggling to come to grips with the world too. There are definitely two sides\nto the argument, and I'm not advocating for any position. There are many parts\nof the country that need work. Racism is a huge problem that we need to solve\nas soon as possible. Denigrating an important bloc of people for the sake of\nmaking a point will only divide the nation even more. If we are to move\nforward and be \"progressive,\" we need to set aside distractions, unify in our\nactions and put our attention to the big picture.

Just\nask [Brendan Eich](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/04/03/mozilla-ceo-\nsteps-down/7262129/), one of the founders of Mozilla, developers of the web\nbrowser Firefox. Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as\nMozilla's CEO. He lasted all of nine days. The reason? Back in 2008 Eich\ndonated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8, the California ballot\ninitiative to ban same-sex marriage. The unearthing of this donation led to\nprotests from gay rights activists and the h [igh profile call for a\nboycott](https://www.mediaite.com/online/okcupid-now-asking-users-to-boycott-\nmozilla-due-to-browser-ceos-gay-marriage-opposition/) of Firefox by dating\nsite [OkCupid.com](http://OkCupid.com). Eich, as many people in circumstances\nsuch as his, was stricken with the sudden desire to \"spend more time with his\nfamily\" and quietly resigned. Regardless of your position on same sex\nmarriage, those activists who led to Eich's resignation should be ashamed.\nTheir basic message? \"You'd better be tolerant. Or else we will show you a\ndisplay of true tolerance. By crushing you.\" In fact, it is no longer enough\nto be tolerant. Prior to his resignation, Eich [told tech site\nCNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-ceo-gay-marriage-firestorm-could-hurt-\nfirefox-cause-q-a/) \"[i]f Mozilla cannot continue to operate according to its\nprinciples of inclusiveness, where you can work on the mission no matter what\nyour background or other beliefs, I think we'll probably fail.\" In the same\ninterview, he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to\nknow that \"without getting into my personal beliefs, which I separate from my\nMozilla work -- when people learned of the donation, they felt pain. I saw\nthat in friends' eyes, [friends] who are LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, or\ntransgendered]. I saw that in 2012. I am sorry for causing that pain.\" Wow.\nEich sounds like an intolerant jerk! No, strike that. He sounds like a\ndedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and\npersonal lives-as well he should have been. But to the activist crowd, it's\nnot enough that people are tolerant. They must offer affirmation of the LGBT\nagenda or pay the price. Their much vaunted toleration doesn't extend to those\nwho might have opposing viewpoints, like Eich. Of course, gay rights activists\nclaim that Eich's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to\nstrip them of their rights. This may or may not be the case, but I'd wager\nthat many of them aren't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about,\nsay, the Second Amendment. And I'm hearing curiously little from these\nchampions of freedom about the fact that [70 percent of California's African\nAmericans](https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/11/70-of-\nafrican-a.html) and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8. The\nuncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which\nminority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama. Even more\nuncomfortable? President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in\n2008. But, then, it's not about principle. It's about ramming through the\n\"right\" outcomes. An [Associated Press\npiece](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/mozilla-ceo-resigns-furor-\ngay-rights-23183497) about Eich's resignation asks \"whether the episode\nundercuts the well-groomed image of Silicon Valley as a marketplace of ideas\nand diversity of thought, and whether, in this case, the tech world\nsurrendered to political correctness enforced through a public shaming on\nsocial media.\" Geez, ya think? Andrew Sullivan, the unreliably conservative\ncolumnist [had this to say](https://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/04/03/the-\nhounding-of-brendan-eich/): Will [Eich] now be forced to walk through the\nstreets in shame? Why not the stocks? The whole episode disgusts me - as it\nshould disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society. If this is\nthe gay rights movement today - hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more\nlike the religious right than anyone else - then count me out. If we are about\nintimidating the free speech of others, we are no better than the anti-gay\nbullies who came before us. The trite knock at the religious right is to be\nexpected from a regular guest on Bill Maher's show, but Sullivan is right to\ncall the gay rights activists out on their bullying tactics. And the man has\nskin in the game, as an openly gay man who has long supported same sex\nmarriage. Kudos to Sullivan for recognizing that support for an issue doesn't\nrequire the squashing of all dissenting viewpoints. Liberals like to mock\nthose who speak of the \"gay agenda.\" The real agenda, they claim, is for\nhomosexuals to be able to live out their lives in dignity with their loved\nones. Such efforts at destroying opposition unfortunately make that more\ndifficult to believe. And activists forget that perhaps next time, they won't\nbe the ones to define which thought crimes should be prosecuted. In a society\nwhich encourages the personal destruction of dissenters, any one of us can\ndevelop the desire to \"spend more time with family\" at any time.\n\n",

He was released from the San Francisco 49ers earlier this year, and he\nhas yet to find work despite several tantalizing openings due to roster\nupheaval and injuries on other teams. This is because many NFL owners and fans\ndid not like how he kneeled for the national anthem. They viewed it as a self-\nindulgent and disrespectful act that politicized what should have been a\nnonpolitical event. But, showing their continued march towards irrelevancy,\nleft leaning commentators like Ryan Clark on ESPN's Mike and Mike show are now\n[saying Kaepernick is a\nvictim](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=20339841). Without a hint of\nirony, Clark said that Kaepernick was the \"flag bearer\" for blacks in America\nand the NFL. But in order to use that analogy, a person would have to actually\nrespect the flag, and this in turn undermines the narrative that liberals and\nactivists are peddling. The narrative from activists, race hucksters, and many\npoliticians is that blacks are disproportionately targeted by cops and the\njudicial system. That they are victims of systemic poverty that leads to\ncrime, and that the root causes and issues that are important to them are not\nbeing addressed. This narrative isn't wholly disconnected from reality, but\nit's twisted into an overtly political narrative that often undermines\nmeaningful reform. Flag bearers are important in history because they often\nrepresent the focal point of command and control. The flag was usually close\nto the commander, and the flag moving forward on the battlefield could\ncommunicate an attack when it was too loud for words. It was an honorable\ntradition to carry the flag, and the enemy often aimed for the flag bearer,\nwhich made it the most dangerous spot on the battlefield. Raising the flag on\nIwo Jima became one of America's most cherished memorials, and seeing the flag\nthrough a nightly bombardment supplied our national anthem. No compatible\nsource was found for this video. The importance of the flag doesn't seem lost\non Ryan Clarke and other analysts when they compare Kaepernick to a flag\nbearer. This makes their use of that analogy all the more tone deaf. They are\nso blinded by their victim narrative that they don't recognize that his very\nprotest was actually an insult to the flag. It's tougher to find people more\nremoved from the poor and supposedly discriminated members of inner cities\nthan professional athletes. Acting macho and street tough is part of their\npersona, but it's just as authentic as professional wrestling. These athletes\nare part of the one percent, who make more money than most Americans and play\nin taxpayer subsidized stadiums while getting special treatment. I can't think\nof an individual more unsuited to lead the supposed civil rights crusade for\nblacks than a pampered 1% athlete. But with a black President, Secretary of\nState, and Supreme Court Justice, it's tough to argue that racism is worse now\nthan in the past when athletes stood and honored the flag. If Ryan Clarke and\nother liberal sports analysts want to praise the act of kneeling for the\nanthem, they should avoid using analogies that underscore the importance of\nthe flag.\n\n",

This is\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/08/politics/pence-indianapolis-flights-\ncost/): How much did Vice President Mike Pence's trip to Indianapolis to watch\n-- and then abruptly leave -- a football game Sunday between the Indianapolis\nColts and San Francisco 49ers cost? Here is an estimate of just the air costs\n(which does not include costs of advance personnel, Secret Service or support\non the ground): According to the Air Force, flying a C-32, the model of plane\nused for Air Force 2, for one hour costs about $30,000. Pence's flight from\nLas Vegas to Indianapolis Saturday took about three hours and 20 minutes, so\nit cost about $100,000 Pence then flew from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on\nSunday, which took about four hours and 45 minutes, costing about $142,500.\nThe grand total: about $242,500. What a joke the media has become. Sponsored\nSponsored\n\n",

            "input": "Many liberal talking heads have made a big deal out of the supposed\ndemographic wave facing Republicans and conservatives as the nation morphs\ninto a more diverse population. Growth rates amongst minorities have begun to\nexceed those of whites. The narrative goes like this -- as the white,\nEuropean-based population diminishes, America will become less conservative\nand more socialist, demanding more and more free stuff. The rich will just\nhave to pay for it -- in other words, the takers will get more from the\nmakers. While the demographic trend may be true, the pre-conceived outcome is\nanything but. I'm not one to forecast a 'conservative century', but I will say\nthe notion that the up-and-coming generation largely believes in socialism is\na falsehood. First of all, many minority groups have historically held\nconservative values. Although this trend has diminished to some extent, due to\nthe brainwashing and self-imposed victimization of minority youth, it has not\ngone away entirely. Hispanics go to church; they believe in hard work. I've\nknow many Hispanic businessmen and families who are angry at the open border\ncrowd pushing for illegal immigration and benefits for millions of\nundocumented immigrants. They did not go through the process legally as many\nimmigrants have and this annoys successful minority entrepreneurs. There is\nalso the fact that 'Obamanomics' and social welfare policies did nothing to\nhelp the minority groups he promised to assist. Aside from increasing\ndependency on government, every other statistic for prosperity for minorities\nwent down. No compatible source was found for this video. Many minorities are\nstarting to see this. I recently overheard one minority veteran tell someone\nat the VA that the government aid was helpful but what he really needed was a\njob. Trump is right -- the dignity of work is a beautiful thing to behold. The\nelection of President Donald J. Trump has been a game changer when considering\nthe political support for one side of the spectrum. The identity politics of\nthe Left has done nothing but cause election losses. That is a fact. The\nwhite, working-class, middle-American will be missing for a long time in the\nDemocratic Party. Hillary Clinton made it perfectly clear that the Left did\nnot care about flyover country during the election. The overt racism of Black\nLives Matter and other minority hate groups has further cemented this\ncondition. What does the Left offer the hard-working American? It doesn't\noffer a job. It doesn't offer dignity. It just offers derision of other\nAmericans and government dependency. This is not what American wants -- hence\nthe election of Donald Trump. Trump sure has delivered, on his promises that\nis. Jobs are being created; economic optimism is soaring; plants are opening;\ncoal mines are being dug; and business investment is growing again. I read\ntoday that Trump will push for America to be the energy capital of the world.\nThe optimism is only going to grow. The business climate is only going to get\nbetter. Americans have seen the results of a decade of socialist, liberal,\nculturally Marxist policies, and they don't like it. But most of all, the\npolicies don't work. All Obama and his minions brought to the table was\nfailure, massive failure. Failure in government, failure in the economy,\nfailure in foreign policy and national security, and failure in the ability of\na citizen to realize the American dream. Americans have had enough. Of course,\nthere will always be those who choose to be dependent on government and live\noff the largess of others. But my gut tells me as Trump makes America great\nagain, many of those people will see the light and actually get a job. The\nyounger generation, who is now moving to college age and called Generation Z,\nhave seen all of this happen. They have seen their parents struggle. They have\nseen their parents lose their dignity. They have seen their parents becoming\ndependent on the local commissar for a handout. They will also see the\nopposite -- they will see the fruits of capitalism. They will see factories\nopen. They will feel the optimism. There will be no where else to attribute\nthis change in circumstances except to Trump and conservative policies.\nAmerica is becoming one big learning lab for its younger citizens. In addition\nto the national policies changing the face of America, there will be changes\nin our university and educational systems. We are at the zenith of cultural\nMarxism right now in this country. It is painfully obvious that the communism\nlovers in our institutions of higher education have had the run of the asylum\nand wreaked havoc. There will be changes here. I don't know what form it will\ntake or how it will happen, but the groundswell of public outrage and alumni\nqueasiness about the lack of freedom of speech on campus is coming to a head.\nThere will be consequences. It is not okay for speech to be restricted\nanywhere in our educational process. It is not okay for due process to be\nwithheld from male victims of rape accusations. It is not okay for tenured\nprofessors to spew racist and communist propaganda at our young people. This\nwill change, I am confident of it. The pendulum is slowly starting to swing\nthe other way. Generation Z will face a smaller sea of Neo-Bolsheviks as they\nenter college. This is a good thing. There was a study released recently which\ndelved into the political beliefs and tendencies of Generation Z as they move\nto take the place of the Millennial generation. There could not be a more\nstriking divide between the 'live in your parent's basement' generation and\nthe new group coming of age. The study concluded that Generation Z is the most\nconservative since the end of World War II. This is a stunning revelation and\nI believe it is due to the factors I have outlined above. They have been able\nto observe the two different views of the world, the two ways of living your\nlife as a taker and a maker. They want to be the latter. Perhaps it is deeper\nand more simple than that. Perhaps they have seen that the Democratic Party --\nthe Left, the 'progressives,' the cultural Marxists, the racists, whatever you\nwant to call this rag-tag opposition to President Trump and Make America Great\nAgain -- have nothing to offer that will make their lives more successful or\nfulfilling. Perhaps Generation Z has seen with their own eyes that the\nDemocratic Party is nothing more than a huge, stinking mountain of organized\ncrime, that desires to steal from other's hard work and vision. Maybe that is\nwhy even the term 'hard work' is now deemed a 'micro aggression' by these\nidiots. Yes, I believe that America is about to experience a generation of\nsuccess and prosperity, driven by a reawakening of conservative principles.\nBefore the election, I did a book signing in a hotel near an airport. The\nyoung manager of the place was an Indian man. He came over and started asking\nme questions from time-to-time when the crowd thinned down. The conversation\nquickly turned to politics and he guardedly asked me my opinions on Trump and\nHillary -- I gave them to him. As I was packing my things to leave an hour or\nso later, he came over and quietly informed me that he was voting for Trump.\n\"My family did things legally,\" he declared, \"I can't stand the Democrats.\"\n\n",

At least 19 people were reported killed in street\nprotests in Iran, while President Hassan Rouhani on one hand defended their\nright to protest but on the other hand warned he would show \"no tolerance\" for\nthose who incite unrest. Many arrests have been made and the government of\nIran says it may seek the death penalty, for what they say are crimes against\nGod, in demonstrations that have gone on for over 5 days in a row. President\nTrump tweeted that \"Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal\nmade with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been\nrepressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom. Along\nwith human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\" The\nuprising in IRAN is just another risk factor in a global oil market that is\ntightening. Strong global demand and shale oil production that is falling far\nshort of what the Energy Information keeps telling us it is. Reports from the\nTexas Railroad Commission is telling us that Texas shale oil production has\nbeen stagnant and not rising as the production decline rate year over year is\ntaking its toll. Total oil stocks are down a whopping 135M barrels just since\nApril even as U.S. oil production is supposedly at a record high. Bad data is\nbecoming a bigger risk as underinvestment has led to the least amount of oil\ndiscoveries in 70 years and the global oil replenishment rate ratio fell to 11\npercent this year, down from more than 50 percent in 2012 according to a new\nreport. That is a dangerous situation, especially because of the over\nestimates of shale oil output. ETF reports that this has led to the lowest\never volumes of oil discoveries in 2017, Rystad Energy said last week. While\nthe low-level of discoveries is not an immediate threat to global oil supply,\nit could become a threat ten years down the road, according to Rystad Energy.\nIn ten years' time, U.S. shale production may peak, at least according to OPEC\nthat sees shale peaking after 2025, although the cartel has conceded that U.S.\ntight oil has defied previous forecasts and has increased production more than\ninitially expected and will continue to do so in the short-term. This year has\nseen less than 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered globally, a\nvolume as low as last seen in the 1940s, Rystad Energy has estimated. What\nworries analysts the most is the fact that this year the reserve replacement\nratio-the amount of discovered resources relative to the amount of production-\nwas a mere 11 percent, compared to 50 percent in 2012, Sonia Mlada Passos,\nSenior Analyst at Rystad Energy, said. The other ongoing risk is Venezuela. An\nexplosion over the weekend that hit Venezuela's largest refinery was an\naccident waiting to happen. Deferred maintenance and bad management as the\nVenezuelan government stole money and failed to do even the most basic\nmaintenance for the facility according to sources. Reuters reported that a\nformer oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a\nnewspaper column on Sunday, accusing the leftist leader of behaving like\nbiblical King Herod and plunging the oil-rich nation into economic\ndevastation. Rafael Ramirez, who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry\nand state energy company PDVSA for a decade, has long been a rival of Maduro.\nIn recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro's handling\nof a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition,\nwidespread food and medicine shortages, the world's steepest inflation, and a\nsurge in emigration. A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the\nnation's United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article\nentitled the \"The Storm\" was perceived as an attack on his government. We\nhaven't even got to the cold. Wicked winter weather is causing a surge in oil\nand natural gas and coal demand. Demand for coal burns hit three-year high\ncausing to temporarily put it above natural gas as the top s U.S. power\nsources. There are reports that they were shortages of natural gas in Northern\nAlberta county under state of emergency due to natural gas disruption. The\nreport said that large parts of northern Alberta was under a state of\nemergency over the weekend due to low natural gas pressure and system outages.\nThe Energy Report has kept our bullish outlook and we still believe that the\ndouble bottom at $26 a barrel was a generational low. Despite all the bearish\nhype that the market had last year and bad info this year oil looks poised for\na big move. Make sure you are hedged!

No, I am not sure if it was illegal, or even honestly what\nthe demonstration was for. Around that time it might have been for anything,\nincluding in support of whoever was the most right-wing candidate available.\n(Don't get excited. It was never further to the right than social democrat,\nand at one time it was the socialist candidate.) What I remember of that\ndemonstration -- one in a string of them -- were the shots from above. If my\nmemory serves me (and understand that after these many years things run\ntogether, but be patient, there's a point to this), the demonstration was in\nAvenida dos Aliados, which despite the name is a plaza, hemmed in between\ntallish, nineteenth/early twentieth century stone buildings. I'd guess from\nmemory four or five stories high. The shots came from either the upper windows\nor the roof of one of these buildings. As someone in the crowd, I remember\npeople startled, starting to move, eddies in the packed multitude, and then\nsomeone ahead of us going down, bloodied. At that point, the running started.\nI don't know how I ended up running near a wall (we were pretty much in the\ncenter of the space) but I remember the moment a hand shot out, grabbed me,\nand pressed me flat against the wall. The shots continued through this, btw.\nThe person who grabbed me was my mom, and for the next few minutes, we\nresisted the crowd going by so close they might pull us with them. I don't\nremember how many people were shot. Maybe four. Far more died in running down\nan underground passage, trying to get away/to the train station. That last is\nwhat my mom saved me from. This is also why my blood boiled this morning when\nHillary Clinton ran her ill-informed, loud mouth about the shooting in Las\nVegas.

One of the best\nexamples for me was when James Comey, then-director of the FBI, laid out the\nmost impressive case against Hillary Clinton for illegal handling of\nclassified information but then basically told the world, April Fools! I\nactually looked around my room to see if I was being filmed. I occasionally\nhave the same experience when I read stories about liberalism and how they\nsupport the Constitution through totalitarian values. I found myself in that\nsame situation this morning after reading about the new procedures for the\npolice in Seattle, Washington. It all started when three outstanding young\ncommunity members attempted to rob a 7-Eleven in downtown Seattle--a 17-year-\nold woman and two 19-year-old men. A police officer who was nearby immediately\nengaged with one of the men in a ground fight. During this fight, he was hit\nover the head with a bottle by the 17-year-old. One of the 19-year olds then\nran into a building, where he engaged in a firefight with the police. During\nthis exchange, one of the officers was shot in the face and ribs. Another\nofficer was shot in the chest, but luckily she was wearing a protective vest.\nYet another officer had his hand grazed by a bullet. The young community\nmember who was shooting at the police was eventually killed in the gunfight,\nand the other two community members were apprehended without further injury.\nSo, what about this is so surreal? While horrific and sad, nothing in this\nstory thus far challenges our current view of the world. That is unfortunate\nin its truth, but what bothers me more is how the police are now being\nrequired to report upon these incidents. Instead of stating the truth--that\nthese individuals are suspects in a crime (until they are tried in court and\njudged to be guilty, they are still innocent, no matter how obvious or\nhorrendous the crime)--the police are now being told they are to refer to them\nas community members. I wrote recently about this very phenomenon. If the left\ncannot ignore the horrific nature of crime, they will simply relabel it so as\nnot to offend those who are affected by the consequences. Well, that is not\nentirely true. There are those whom the left will not concern itself with. The\nvictim of the crime will clearly be affected by this event. I am certain that\nthey will carry with them a new sense of fear for the rest of their lives. The\nofficers who were shot will also be affected forever as well, both mentally\nand physically. Being shot at is a significant event; I can only imagine that\nbeing shot magnifies this factor exponentially. Not only will the officers\nshot have their lives changed, but think of their families and especially\ntheir children. Every day they will wonder if that is the last time they will\nsee their mother or father. Yet the left does not view any of them worthy of\ntheir guardianship. No compatible source was found for this video. As always,\nliberals will attempt to take responsibility away from the perpetrators of\ncrime and throw that accountability onto society itself (often by blaming the\nvictim). Since the crime itself cannot be questioned, they will instead change\nthe verbiage so as to misconstrue the true depth. These scums aren't suspects\nat all, they are simply community members. No different from you or me in any\nway that matters or is worthy of note. This is the essence of Newspeak, which\nGeorge Orwell wrote of in his book 1984. If you want to control the minds of\nthe people, simply choose the words that they can use. Once you lack the words\nto describe something, then that event or emotion cannot exist. Here we can\nsee that very occurrence in real life. Forget about the victims or the police.\nForget about those affected by causality. They are simply the collateral\ndamage caused by society failing. There is no personal responsibility--only\nresponsibility of society. Therefore, there is no individual control. This is\nwhy the left is so vehemently opposed to any sort of label that makes an\nindividual take responsibility for themselves. To do so leaves them powerless\nand voids their control. In the book 1984, the hero makes a very astute\nstatement: \"Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter;\nonly feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you--that would be the\nreal betrayal.\" This fact is not lost by liberals. Simply forcing someone to\nconform is not enough. Making someone say what you want does not change their\nbeliefs or values. Instead, manipulate their ability to formulate thoughts\nthrough limitation of the language. I will close with this quote from the same\nbook, which I feel sums up my view of progressives completely. The Party seeks\npower entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others;\nwe are interested solely in power, pure power…We are different from the\noligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the\nothers…never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended,\nperhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a\nlimited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human\nbeings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever\nseizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it\nis an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a\nrevolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.\nThe object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture.\nThe object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.\n\n",

What's more, the goal was to\nnot just damage the Trump presidency but set the Republican president up for\nimpeachment, according to Ed Klein's latest from\n[Regnery](https://www.regnery.com/) Publishing, [All Out War: The Plot to\nDestroy Trump.](https://www.amazon.com/All-Out-War-Destroy-\nTrump/dp/1621576981) It goes on sale tomorrow. In an exclusive excerpt\nprovided to Secrets, Klein described a \"Christmastime\" dinner during which\nnational security adviser Susan Rice pushed plans to \"unmask, or disclose, the\nnames of several Trump campaign associates who were mentioned or whose\nconversations were captured in intelligence intercepts of Russian officials.\"\nKlein, a former New York Times editor who has written several insider accounts\ncritical of the Clintons and Obamas, said that Obama knew of Rice's efforts to\ndisclose the names in hopes they would leak to the media and spark an\ninvestigation. \"He knew Rice wanted to encourage leaks to the Washington Post\nand the New York Times accusing Trump and his campaign of colluding with\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in the American presidential election,\" Klein\nwrote. \"If Rice's plot succeeded -- that is, if it could be proved that Trump\nhad colluded with Putin during the campaign or, later, if it could be proved\nthat he had tried to prevent an investigation into such collusion -- Trump\nwould likely face charges of impeachment,\" said the new Klein book. But, he\nadded, Obama didn't know that his closest aide, Valerie Jarrett, was behind\nthe plot. Rice eventually had to testify to Congress about her actions, and\ndenied leaking Trump campaign and associate names. Klein does not reveal his\nsource other than offering the source as Jarrett's \"friend.\" During the\ndinner, wrote Klein, first lady Michelle Obama raised concerns that the effort\nwas clearly a political plot to \"sandbag\" Trump. Rice, however, is quoted\nsaying she was worried about national security and she referenced the leaks of\nDemocratic National Committee emails, embarrassing to the Clinton campaign, by\nRussian sources. She wanted, said the book, to make sure that the alleged\nlinks to the Trump campaign and Russia became public before Trump came to\noffice. \"She said she was afraid that once Trump got into the White House, the\nevidence of collusion would be covered up or destroyed,\" wrote Klein. At that\npoint during the dinner, the former first lady, said the book, cautioned that\nthe plot could \"bite us in the ass.\" As her husband mulled Rice's plea to\nunmask the names by lowering security clearances, Jarrett's \"friend\" told\nKlein, \"Most of the time he had to choose between the lesser of two evils.\nThis was an example of such a dilemma. It was clearly unethical to use illegal\nleaks to sabotage Trump. But Barack could argue that it was his patriotic to\nduty to draw attention to the possibility that the Trump campaign had\nconspired with the Russians to influence the outcome of an American election.\"\nAt point, his source said, \"Valerie piped up. 'Well,' she said, '[FBI Director\nJames] Comey thinks Susan's on to something. He's investigating whether the\nTrump campaign cooperated with the Russians. There must be something there.'\"\nKlein concluded, \"Valerie has a sixth sense how to handle Barack and Michelle.\nShe understood Michelle's reservations and her desire to protect her husband,\nand she wanted to give Michelle a chance to vent. But Valerie left no doubt\nthat she was in favor of Barack going along with Susan's scheme.\" Paul Bedard,\nthe Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at\npbedard@washingtonexaminer.com\n\n",

Trump wants to be president of a country whose fundamental\norganizing document he almost completely disagrees with. Even if he has read\nthe Constitution - which is a serious question, [as raised by Khizr and\nGhazala Khan during the DNC](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/khizr-khan-\ntrump-naturalization-test_us_57b22b09e4b0863b0284510f) - Trump doesn't believe\nin its core principles and values. You know, the principles and values that\nmake America great. This disdain was on full display Monday. When talking\nabout the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, [Trump lamented the\nfact](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/19/494633030/trump-calls-it-sad-that-n-y-\nbombing-suspect-gets-medical-care-lawyer) that the Constitution would require\nsuspected bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami to be treated fairly. \"He will be\nrepresented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various\ncourt systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment\nwill not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation,\" he said. \"We\nmust have speedy but fair trials and we must deliver a just and very harsh\npunishment to these people.\" Trump also decried that Rahami would be given\n\"amazing hospitalization\" and \"a fully modern and updated hospital room.\"\nPutting aside Trump's inaccurate assessment of the [quality of medical care\nprisoners receive](https://www.schr.org/our-work/prisons-jails/healthcare) and\nthe [woefully underfunded public defender\nsystem](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/public-defenders-gideon-\nsupreme-court-charts) in the U.S., Trump is attacking some of the bedrock\nprinciples of American justice. Ever since [Gideon v.\nWainwright](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/landmark_gideon.html),\nthe Sixth Amendment to the Constitution has been understood to require that\neveryone charged with serious offenses in this country receive defense\ncounsel. This protection for criminal defendants is cause for celebration, not\ncastigation. Speaking about this right in glowing terms, [the Supreme Court\nhas said](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/372/335) it is\n\"necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty\" and called\nthis a \"noble ideal\" without which there can be no fair trial. Similarly, the\nEighth Amendment prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" We already know\nfrom [Trump's advocating extreme forms of\ntorture](https://www.justsecurity.org/30104/trump-torture/) that he is no fan\nof this part of the Constitution, but his comments Monday make that even\nclearer. Prisoners' serious medical needs cannot be ignored; doing so would be\n\"cruel and unusual.\" [The Supreme Court has\nexplained](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/429/97) that\n\"infliction of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary\nstandards of decency\" and outlined the basic principle that \"the public be\nrequired to care for the prisoner, who cannot, by reason of the deprivation of\nhis liberty, care for himself.\" Just this weekend, he once again showed that\nhe couldn't care less about the First Amendment. After The New York Times\n[published a story](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/nyregion/donald-trump-\ntax-breaks-real-\nestate.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&action=click&contentCollection=nyregion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront)\nfinding that Trump relied on $885 million in tax breaks to build his real\nestate empire in New York City, [Trump\ntweeted](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/296485-trump-\nthreatens-to-sue-new-york-times), \"My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes\nso badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching.\nReally disgusting.\" Of course, as any middle school student will tell you, the\nFirst Amendment protects the freedom of the press. Part of that protection is\nthat no public figure [can sue as a result of a bad\nstory](http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-\nresources/supreme-court-landmarks/new-york-times-v-sullivan-podcast) without\nproving malice, meaning that the journalists knew the story was false or\ndemonstrated complete disregard for whether it was true. This standard is\ncrucial in protecting the press from being attacked by people who don't like\nunflattering coverage. Without this principle, the press would be too scared\nto write pieces critical of the powerful, and the First Amendment would be\nvirtually meaningless. It's been clear from other contexts, though, that \"\n[virtually\nmeaningless](https://action.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pages/trumpmemos.pdf)\"\nis how Trump views the First Amendment as a whole. Among other things, he has\ncalled for violence against individuals expressing their opinions and\nadvocated for a religious test for those entering the country. These positions\nfly in the face of the First Amendment's protection of free expression and\nfreedom of religion, as well as its guarantee against an established state\nreligion. Trump is no fan of the rest of the Constitution either. His recently\nannounced maternity leave plan includes no coverage for fathers, which shows\nhis lack of concern for the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause; his\ninsistence that [women and doctors should be punished for\nabortion](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/03/30/trump_some_form_of_punishment_for_women_if_abortion_becomes_illegal.html)\nshows that he doesn't believe in a constitutional right to privacy under the\nDue Process Clause; [he has promised to violate\ntreaties](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/17/rand-\npaul/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru/), which are\nconstitutionally recognized sources of law; he [doesn't understand the\ndifference](http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/donald-trump-libel-\nlaws-219866) between state and federal authority, the basic principle of\nfederalism which underlies the Constitution; nor does he [care about\nseparation of powers](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435296/donald-\ntrump-constitution-end-separation-powers), the founding constitutional idea\nthat the president, Congress and the courts have different responsibilities in\norder to prevent tyranny. In other words, other than his repeated invocation\nof the Second Amendment, including his not-so-oblique references to one of his\nsupporters shooting Hillary Clinton (something that [came up again this\nweekend](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-\nguns-secret-service/)), Trump has shown that he disagrees not just with one or\ntwo isolated parts of the Constitution - which would be within normal\ndemocratic bounds, and is countenanced by the Constitution's [amendment\nprocess](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/article-v.html)\n- but rather with the very fabric of the document. This is highly unusual in\nAmerican politics, where most debate occurs against the backdrop of accepted\nconstitutional principles. Trump doesn't appear to accept those principles at\nall, and instead seems to want to be president of a country with a foreign\nunderstanding of government and its relationship to the people. If Trump were\nelected, he would have to swear the same allegiance to the Constitution that\nevery president has before him: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will\nfaithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to\nthe best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States.\" Based on how he has campaigned over the past year, if he were\nto utter those last 10 words, he would be lying - [as has become par for the\ncourse](http://www.attn.com/stories/10483/chart-compares-presidential-\ncandidates-honesty) with Donald Trump.\n\n",

Ingraham, who was guest-hosting Tuesday on Fox News' \"Tucker\nCarlson Tonight,\" blasted balking GOP members of Congress and Democrats for\nblocking and stalling the president's legislative agenda throughout his first\n200 days in office. Noting that Republican senators such as Jeff Flake\n(Arizona), John McCain (Arizona), and Thom Tillis (North Carolina) delight in\nmaking rounds on the news talk shows to criticize Trump, Ingraham pointed out\ntheir own plunging approval numbers as the American voters wait for them to\nfulfill their campaign promises. \"Do you know what a liberal's idea of\nArmageddon is? No, it's not a nuclear North Korea, but a successful Trump\npresidency. Do you know what the Never-Trump Republicans on Capitol Hill fear\nthe most? No, it's not ISIS and it's not a 5,000-point [drop] in the Dow, but\na successful Trump presidency,\" Ingraham said. \"Today is the 200th day of this\nadministration,\" she added. \"And despite the hyperventilation and alarmism\nwe're hearing from the national press corps -- they're prematurely declaring\nthe Trump administration a failure, of course -- but in fact, it's the\nresistance to Trump that is playing a risky gambit.\" No compatible source was\nfound for this video. In this \"resistance,\" Ingraham included Senate Minority\nLeader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.),\nand \"supposed right\" senators such as Flake, McCain and Tillis. And what\nunites all of them is their sad and rather pathetic fear and loathing of\nPresident Trump,\" she said. \"So they want you so saturated in this endless and\nmindless Russia story deal, and other irrelevant West Wing staff intrigues\nthat's mostly fueled by leaks, that you even begin to believe their negative\nspin. And let's face it -- these people are happiest when his numbers go down,\nwhen his legislation and his confirmations stall, even if their own approval\nnumbers go down, too. It's like they don't even care.\" Pointing to recent\nQuinnipiac University poll measuring congressional approval ratings, Ingraham\nnoted these politicians have plummeted even as Trump's numbers have dwindled\ninto the 30s. \"And Trump's approval rating may only be about 37 percent\naccording to one poll, but check this out. Tom Tillis' approval rating, North\nCarolina -- 29 percent. Nancy Pelosi's -- 27 percent. Chuck Schumer's is 26\npercent, and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell's is a very impressive\n17 percent,\" Ingraham said, noting that McConnell has failed repeatedly to\nrally 50 of 52 GOP senators in support of various measures to repeal and\nreplace Obamacare. \"Now despite two years of non-stop bile and vitriol from\nWashington's bipartisan elite class, Trump is actually beating all of them,\"\nshe added. \"Now while of course it's true that key legislative successes are\nlacking, whether on health care, tax reform, infrastructure -- but it's\nequally true as well that President Trump has done a lot even without Congress\nto make our lives better.\" Ingraham said that Trump does need to work on\nboosting his approval numbers, but she argued the president has \"done a heck\nof a lot in just 200 days.\" Pointing to the successful confirmation of Supreme\nCourt Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's slashing of Obama-era red-tape and\nregulations, the thriving stock market, consumer confidence and more, Ingraham\nsaid that Trump's presidency hasn't been the failure that the media, the Left\nand the Never-Trumpers are making it out to be. \"His approval numbers -- yeah,\nthey need boosting, that's for sure. But considering the 24/7 media onslaught\nagainst him, the distraction of the Russia probe, and the resistance from\nCongress -- both sides in Congress -- he's done a heck of a lot in just 200\ndays,\" she said. \"And if he can keep focused and he can keep his team\nmotivated, keep them together, and put pressure on the Hill to deliver on some\nof these big issues, he'll improve his numbers and he'll grow the populist\nmovement.\" To read related content visit\n[LifeZette](http://www.lifezette.com/).\n\n",

            "input": "Jemele Hill in September 2016. Jemele Hill, the outspoken host of ESPN's 6:00\np.m. SportsCenter, called President Donald Trump a \"white supremacist\" on\nTwitter. ESPN later posted a statement, saying her comments \"do not represent\nthe position of ESPN\" and she knows her comment was \"inappropriate.\" The White\nHouse called Hill's comments a \"fireable offense.\" The 41-year-old Hill has\nbeen hosting the 6:00 edition of SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 with Michael Smith\nsince February. Hill and Smith previously co-hosted Numbers Never Lie and His\n&amp; Hers before they were promoted to the flagship show. You can follow Hill\non [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jemelehill). Here's what you need to know\nabout Hill's politics and her latest brush with controversy. 1. Hill Called\nTrump a 'White Supremacist' After Posting About Kid Rock Hill's tweet about\nTrump was posted late on September 11 after she retweeted a [The Hill\narticle](http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/350056-kid-rock-slams-media-\nextreme-left-and-al-sharpton) about musician Kid Rock, who has been teasing a\nrun for Michigan Senator after launching\n[KidRockforSenate.com](https://www.kidrockforsenate.com/) in July. The article\nis about Rock's [long Facebook\npost](https://www.facebook.com/kidrock/posts/10155502465850049) about the\n\"extreme left.\" \"\"Pretty funny how scared I have them all and their only\nagenda is to try and label people / me racist who do not agree or cower to\nthem,\" Rock wrote. \"He loves black people so much that he pandered to racists\nby using a flag that unquestionably stands for dehumanizing black people,\"\nHill wrote, referring to the singer's use of the Confederate Battle flag.\nAfter a back-and-forth with other Twitter users, [Hill\nwrote](https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/907391978194849793), \"Donald\nTrump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white\nsupremacists.\" Hill [also\ntweeted](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/12/jemele-hill-gets-\nslap-wrist-espn-trump-comments/) other messages about Trump. \"He is\nunqualified and unfit to be president. He is not a leader. And if he were not\nwhite, he never would have been elected. He has surrounded himself with white\nsupremacists -- no they are not \"alt right\" -- and you want me to believe he\nisn't a white supremacist?\" She went on, \"Trump is the most ignorant,\noffensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white\nsupremacy. Period. The height of white privilege is being able to ignore his\nwhite supremacy, because it's of no threat to you. Well, it's a threat to me.\"\n\"Donald Trump is a bigot. Glad you could live with voting for him. I couldn't,\nbecause I cared about more than just myself,\" she wrote. After the tweet\n[gained attention in the conservative\nmedia](http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2017/09/11/espns-jemele-hill-calls-\npresident-trump-a-white-supremacist/), ESPN [issued a\nstatement](https://twitter.com/ESPNPR/status/907683111693164545?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Enews%7Ctwgr%5Etweet).\n\"The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the President do not\nrepresent the position of ESPN,\" the statement reads. \"We have addressed this\nwith Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate.\" Hill has\ncontinued to Tweet, but on other subjects. 2. Hill Has Tweeted About Politics\nBefore, Despite ESPN's 2016 Memo Asking Talent Not to Tweet About Politics\nHill has made her politics clear on her [Twitter\npage](https://twitter.com/jemelehill). She has a tweet with photos of her 2015\nand 2016 visits to the White House to meet President Barack Obama pinned to\nher page. Twitter users frequently complain to her, and she typically\nresponds. In [January 2016, ESPN issued a\nmemo](https://www.espnfrontrow.com/2016/01/2016-presidential-election-\ncoverage-policy/) to employees to avoid making political comments. Since then,\nSage Steele lost a hosting position after writing that she was sad to see the\n\"joy\" in the faces of anti-Trump protesters. [Curt Schilling was famously\nfired](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/sports/baseball/curt-schilling-is-\nfired-by-espn.html) in April 2016 for an offensive post about transgender\npeople. After the Pulse nightclub shootings in Orlando in June 2016, when a\nman killed 49 people inside a gay nightclub, Hill wrote, \"So in a country\nwhere we have done everything possible to undermine the LGBTQ community, we\nare suddenly lecturing Islam on homophobia. Oh.\" [Forbes asked ESPN\nPR](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexreimer/2016/06/13/why-hasnt-espn-\ndisciplined-jemele-hill-for-political-tweet-about-the-orlando-\nshootings/#689810bc244a) why Hill wasn't fired after that message. A\nspokesperson told the magazine that Hill's statement wasn't a violation of the\n2016 memo. 3. Hill Defended Politics Appearing on ESPN, Saying 'Athletes Are\nDragging Us Here' ESPN has been dealing with subscriber losses for some time,\nand its apparent liberal slant on politics has taken the blame in the media.\nConservatives point to Schilling's firing and Caitlyn Jenner receiving the\nArthur Ashe courage award in 2015 as examples. Not firing Hill for her\ncomments will certainly not help. SportCenter's Linda Cohn [also\nadmitted](http://nypost.com/2017/04/27/sportscenter-anchor-agrees-politics-\nare-hurting-espn/) that politics are hurting ESPN. During a conference in\nJune, Hill defended the coverage of political topics, noting that the athletes\nthey cover have made it difficult to avoid politics. \"I just hadn't noticed\nthe correlation between us being called more liberal as you see more women in\na position on our network… as you see more ethnic diversity, then all of a\nsudden ESPN is too liberal. So I wonder, when people say that, what they're\nreally saying,\" Hill said, [reports Yahoo\nNews](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sportscenter-anchor-jemele-hill-espns-\npolitics-athletes-dragging-us-193537563.html). \"The other part of it is that\nwe're journalists, and people have to understand, these uncomfortable\npolitical conversations… the athletes are dragging us here.\" Hill continued,\nnoting that they never asked Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the national\nanthem and they didn't expect Gregg Popovich to go off on Donald Trump during\npress conferences. \"You have athletes saying they're going to the White House,\nnot going to the White House, that's all sports news,\" Hill continued. \"It\ndidn't just start with this generation of athletes, it's always been that way.\nSometimes when I hear a viewer say they don't want their politics mixed with\nsports, I say, 'What did you think about Muhammad Ali?' And then all of a\nsudden it's glowing praise.\" Hill made [similar comments in an interview with\nNewsday](http://www.newsday.com/sports/media/espn-s-sportscenter-continues-\nevolving-with-new-jemele-hill-michael-smith-show-at-6-p-m-1.13012896).\n\"Whether we want to discuss it or not, athletes are dragging us into these\nconversations,\" Hill said in January. \"It's not that Mike and I wake up one\nday and say, 'Hey, today we're going to be MSNBC.' It's usually based off a\nnews story that is relevant to sports.\" 4\\. Hill Joined ESPN in 2006 As a\nColumnist &amp; Mentioned Race in Her Columns Hill has been at ESPN since\n2006, when she joined EPSN.com as a columnist. Over time, she began appearing\non ESPN TV shows, including First Take, Outside the Lines and others. A short\ntime after she was hired, she [spoke with the Columbia Journalism\nReview](http://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/jemele_hill_on_being_black_fem.php)\nabout being a young, black female journalist and the reaction you get when you\nwrite about race. \"Any time you write about race, people get incensed,\" Hill\nsaid in 2006. \"I recently wrote a column saying that there is just as much\nevidence against Lance Armstrong as there is [against] Barry Bonds, and part\nof the reason there is this extraordinary benefit of the doubt extended to\nLance is because he's white. That's not the overwhelming reason, mind you.\nJust a factor in the whole equation. I got a ton of mail about that one, even\nthough I posed the racial element in the next-to-last graf of the column.\" In\n2011, she started the His &amp; Hers podcast with Michael Smith, which soon\nreplaced Smith's Numbers Never Lie in 2013. They continued hosting the show\nuntil they moved to SportsCenter. Their part of the show is known as SC6 With\nMichael And Jemele. [The Los Angeles Times\nreported](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-espn-\nlayoffs-20170306-story.html) in March that Smith and Hill signed new\ncontracts, even as ESPN had its massive lay-off earlier this year. Hill [told\nDan Patrick](http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/jemele-hill-and-michael-smith-\ntalk-the-six-drake-race-debate-more-with-dan-patrick.html) that their\ncontracts weren't up for another year when they were approached to host SC6.\n\"The fact that they asked us to do this, that's a key part of it. This was not\nour plan. We were about a year out from our contract being up,\" Hill said in\nJanuary. \"We knew that they liked us and wanted us to keep doing our thing. We\nwere of the mentality that we were just going to be His and Hers. And what\nwere things that were needed to improve that? And the way it just kind of\nhappened caught us by surprise.\" 5\\. Hill Was Suspended in 2008 for Writing\nThat Rooting for the Celtics Would Be Like 'Saying Hitler Was a Victim' In\n2008, Hill had her first brush with controversy at ESPN. The Detroit native\ncompared rooting for the Boston Celtics instead of the Pistons to \"saying\nHitler was a victim.\" \"Rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a\nvictim. It's like hoping Gorbachev would get to the blinking red button before\nReagan. Deserving or not, I still hate the Celtics,\" Hill wrote. Hill was\nsuspended for a week and the statement was taken out of her column. She also\n[wrote an apology](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=hill/080623).\nHowever, this was actually just the start of another controversy, as ESPN's\nLou Holtz made a similar remark later that year. He apologized too, but wasn't\nsuspended. In an [interview with Deadspin](http://deadspin.com/5066753/jemele-\nhill-just-taking-this-whole-lou-holtz-hitler-backlash-in-stride), Hill\nshrugged it off. \"Many have said that ESPN treated me unfairly. The 64,000\nquestion: How do I really feel? My initial answer is a story, or rather, a\nmoment,\" she told Deadspin in 2008. \"A couple years ago, I was visiting the\nPoynter Institute, one of the foremost journalism think tanks in the country,\nand I sat in on a session taught by one of my favorite columnist and people,\nthe Washington Post's Sally Jenkins. A student asked her if she ever got upset\nwhen other writers rewarded -- particularly if she knew they weren't as good.\nAnd Sally said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- that she always prided herself\non keeping her eyes on her own career. That's my answer. That's how I feel.\"\n\n",

Their\nvisibility is imperative as Chicanas continue to work in social justice,\nfighting the good fights within various movements. \"Chicana Tributes: Activist\nWomen of the Civil Rights Movement\" aims to share those untold stories of the\nwomen who formed an important part of the movement. CREDIT: Chicana\nTributes/San Diego State University Chicano Archive The book documents the\nexperiences of 61 Chicanas from the '60s to the present who have paved the way\nin the fight for human rights as educators, attorneys, activists, artists and\nmore. Some of the women featured have passed, while others remain active. Each\nof their stories were written by an author of their or their loved ones'\nchoosing, creating beautiful pieces that bring together women for the purpose\nof honoring women. The project came about by the Chicano Archive Committee at\nSan Diego State University, which works to document the people and historical\nevents that have occurred around the Chicano movement. Committee members and\nco-editors Sonia Lopez and Rita Sanchez selected the women featured in\n\"Chicana Tributes\" to document what they believe is missing from the history\nbooks. \"These stories need to be told so people can know that some of the\nthings they take for granted, a lot of people fought for,\" says Lopez. \"Most\nof the time, the men are the ones who are recognized. Any advancement in the\nChicano community, the credit is mostly given to the men.\" Lopez, a longtime\nactivist and educator, was the first person to teach a Chicana history class\nat San Diego State back in 1972. Back then, she found a need to address\nChicana issues, and still sees the need today. \"There's still not enough\ninformation on Chicanas that have contributed to history, society and the\ncommunity,\" she says. \"They need to be recognized.\" Among the women featured\nare ACLU leader Norma Chavez, Laura Rodriguez, matriarch of the National\nHistoric Landmark Chicano Park, Charlotte Hernandez Terry, the first woman to\npaint a mural at Chicano Park, and Delia Moreno, who along with her daughters\nform Trio Moreno, which played protest trio music during important events in\nthe Chicano movement. In telling the stories of these trailblazers, Lopez says\nyoung women will have one more book they can see themselves in, which is\nnecessary as there are few books that offer that. Especially as the women\nfeatured have overcome many struggles in their life and come out on top. \"It's\namazing that these women still had the courage and resilience in spite of all\ntheir hardships,\" Lopez says. \"We're trying to teach people this is life. Life\nis a struggle. Part of becoming who you are is a struggle. And for us,\nespecially, as Mexicanas on this side of the border. We chose the word\n'chicana' to define our own identity, tell our history, tell our story and\ntell our roots. By reading this story people will learn, people will\nappreciate and feel inspired.\" \"I think young women today are looking for role\nmodels,\" she adds. \"I don't feel that we have enough role models out there of\npeople that are doing things or have done things to inspire, to motivate. With\nthis book, young women can see that it's possible to do. The groundwork has\nbeen laid by the women featured in this book.\" READ: This Chicana Is Taking\nOver The Instagram Page Of A Major Art Museum To Show Off Chicano Art Wanna\nshare this story with friends?

Many prominent liberals,\nconservatives, moderates, and libertarians have concluded that the president\nis off his rocker. The tangible evidence for that proposition is thin, and\nTrump seems to be enjoying himself more and more. Maybe we're all just\nprojecting. \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" is the phrase used by those\nsympathetic to the president to explain liberals' hair-on-fire response to\nanything Trump says or does. TDS is also an occupational hazard of being a\nmember of the Republican establishment or a movement conservative who cares\nabout such trite concepts as political principles. This became clear again\nlast week in the hysteria over Trump's approach to the Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals program. In response to the administration's original\nannouncement rescinding DACA, liberals came unglued. Not content to call the\ndecision dumb and racist, which they did, they played the sanity card. \"It is\nlunacy,\" opined Minnesota's Democratic governor, Mark Dayton. The president,\nadded HBO comedic pundit John Oliver, is out of his mind. \"Utter insanity,\"\n[proclaimed](http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/locals-voice-strong-\nopposition-to-trump-s-daca-\nstance/article_16ebcf40-6ac1-5c41-8b21-17c41cfc280c.html) Susan Hay, a co-\nfounder of a Florida-based pro-immigrant and refugee nonprofit. That was then.\nA few days later, after dining on Chinese food (you can't make this stuff up)\nat the White House with Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and\nChuck Schumer, Trump reversed field on DACA. In the real world, such a\ndevelopment is called processing new information. In modern U.S. politics,\nit's considered treason -- or insanity. This time, it was conservatives who\nmelted down. Ann Coulter pronounced it the death of the GOP brand; Iowa\nRepublican Rep. Steve King, an immigration hardliner, claimed it would \"crack\"\nTrump's core base of support; various commenters on conservative news sites\ntheorized that Trump had been taken over by aliens. Not the illegal kind, the\nkind from outer space. Since before Trump's inauguration, Democratic attorneys\nin the nation's capital have contemplated replacing Trump under the 25th\nAmendment's requirement that the president is able to \"discharge the powers\nand duties of his office,\" i.e. impeaching him on grounds he's intellectually\nincapacitated. Although this idea itself is bonkers, Coulter alluded to it--\nnot unfavorably--Friday. \"At this point,\" she tweeted, \"who DOESN'T want Trump\nimpeached?\" Fellow conservative pundit Laura Ingraham, more measured in her\ncriticism, noted that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had spent most of the year\nspeculating that Trump is \"mentally unstable [but] is praising him today.\"\nOrdinary civilians are getting into the psychology racket, too. \"Jody,\" an\nArizona conservative who dialed in to Ingraham's radio show, said she was\nsuffering from a new strain of the disease: \"Pelosi Trump Schumer Disorder,\"\n[she called it](http://www.npr.org/2017/09/14/551053707/conservatives-fume-\nover-daca-deal-as-trump-tries-to-mollify-his-base). \"I am done if they don't\nbuild the wall.\" Jody was kidding, or at least half-kidding, but stressing out\nto this degree over politics is becoming a national obsession. It can't be\nhealthy. And as for labeling as cuckoo those with whom we disagree, well,\nthat's an old KGB tactic. We can't let Vladimir Putin do that to us.\nUnfortunately, the psychology racket is full of those with no sense of\nhistory. A new book arrived, unsolicited, in the mail recently with a long\ntitle: \"The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health\nExperts Assess a President.\" The cover gives the game away, but the publisher\nalso included a foreword from 91-year-old psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, who\noffers the melodramatic view that clinicians who don't warn the world about\nDonald Trump's shortcomings are akin to Nazi doctors who worked at Auschwitz.\nAt the risk of practicing medicine without a license, I'd suggest that this\nhistorical comparison is de facto evidence of TDS -- and paranoid grandiosity.\nA better title would have been \"27 Angry Democrats With Advanced Degrees Who\nVoted Against Trump and Say He's Crazy Although They've Never Met Him.\" Lifton\nand others associated with this project are part of something called the \"Duty\nto Warn\" project. The word \"duty\" is a term of art, given that since 1973, the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association had cautioned its members against diagnosing\npatients they've not personally evaluated. Although this seems like common\nsense, it's more than that: It's a hard-earned lesson. It's called the\n\"Goldwater Rule,\" and it comes from the 1964 presidential campaign. In October\nof that year, when educated elites were just as unhinged over the idea of a\nRepublican populist in the White House as they are today, provocative left-\nwing pamphleteer Ralph Ginzburg published an article in his \"Fact\" magazine\nwith an [incendiary\nheadline](http://the60sat50.blogspot.com/2014/09/september-october-1964-barry-\ngoldwater.html): \"1,189 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit\nto Be President!\" For those too young to remember, Barry Goldwater was a\nconservative Arizona senator and the Republican Party's 1964 presidential\nnominee. Key in the creation of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Goldwater was also\na decorated World War II pilot, a fiscal conservative, a fierce anti-\ncommunist, and friends in the Senate with John F. Kennedy. As Donald Trump\nwould do 52 years later, Goldwater wrested the GOP nomination away from the\nEstablishment, creating a fissure in Republican politics that exists to this\nday. Unlike Trump, Goldwater did not become president. He lost to Lyndon\nJohnson in a historic landslide. I've never heard any political observer blame\nthe Fact magazine article for that defeat, but it was so nasty and gratuitous\nthat when the campaign was over Goldwater filed a libel suit in federal court.\nOf the 12,356 psychiatrists queried by Ginzburg, 2,417 responded - and only\n657 pronounced Goldwater psychologically fit to be president. Some 1,189 of\nthese quacks diagnosed the senator -- on the record, with their names attached\n- as unfit, offering such dubious diagnoses as \"megalomania,\" \"paranoid\npersonality, \"emotionally unstable,\" \"immature,\" \"grossly psychotic,\" \"mass\nmurderer,\" \"immoral,\" \"chronic schizophrenic,\" \"dangerous lunatic\" and -\nstupidest of all -- \"cowardly.\" Goldwater won his case, despite the high bar\npublic officials face in such matters. When he testified in federal court, he\ncame across as rational, composed, normal, and emotionally healthy. His\ncritics were the ones who were unhinged. Is that happening again? Donald Trump\nseemed almost happy last week. Sure, he wants good coverage in the New York\nTimes. Doesn't everyone? And, yes, he'd rather spend time with Chuck Schumer\nthan Mitch McConnell. Who wouldn't? He wants to build a wall to prevent future\nwaves of illegal immigration, but has a soft spot for \"Dreamers.\" He was in\nhis element comforting hurricane victims. These traits make him crazy? He\ncould be the sanest politician in Washington right now. Secret Message from\nGod Found in Human DNA (See What It Says)\n\n",

Trump says he wants to put America First in\nall matters. But this isn't the America that many of us cherish - the nation\nof immigrants, of the Statue of Liberty.

Rep.\nCedric Richmond of Louisiana, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus,\ntweeted that the president's comments \"are further proof that his Make America\nGreat Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda.\" The White\nHouse issued a statementthat didn't deny his slur, but defended his stand on\nimmigration. Early Friday, Trump, who never apologizes for anything, offered a\ndenial in a series of tweets, though it's difficult to take him at his word\ngiven his track record of lies. \"The language used by me at the DACA meeting\nwas tough, but this was not the language used,\" the president tweeted. \"What\nwas really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!\"\nLater Friday, Trump signed the proclamation for the Martin Luther King Jr.\nholiday. Reading prepared remarks, he called the civil rights icon a \"great\nAmerican hero\" who preached racial equality. He refused to answer questions\nabout the uproar, including whether he was racist. To say the scene was\njarring doesn't begin to capture how bizarre it was. This is beyond the daily\ndrama and craziness coming out of this White House, and is already hurting the\nnation's standing around the globe. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said\nTrump's \"vile comments\" only \"make the jobs of Americans stationed all over\nthe world harder - soldiers, diplomats and businesses.\" \"We all need to stop\npretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the\nworld espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements\nin our society,\" Feinstein said in perhaps her toughest statement yet on\nTrump. \"If the president can't control himself and lead this country with the\nauthority, dignity and leadership it requires, then he shouldn't be the\npresident. There's no room for racism in the Oval Office.\" Related stories\nfrom Sacramento Bee  Trump denies 'shithole' comment but Illinois senator\nconfirms the remarks Trump denies 'shithole countries' comment and says Haiti\nslurs were 'made up by Dems' Trump asks why US should accept immigrants from\n's---hole countries', sources say Yet the sad truth is that all of this may\nactually solidify Trump's support among some in his base - the one-third of\nAmericans who apparently will stand by him no matter what he does or says, no\nmatter how outrageous or unfair or damaging. For me, however, the conclusion\nis inescapable. He's a stain on the presidency. He's a demagogue. And he very\nwell could be a full-on racist. It's terrible.

Millar and others, reveals that global warming climate models are\nflat wrong, having been deceptively biased toward \"worst case\" warming\npredictions that now turn out to be paranoid scare mongering. The paper,\nentitled, \" [Emission budgets and pathways consistent with limiting warming to\n1.5\n°C](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo3031.html?foxtrotcallback=true),\"\nconcludes that the global warming long feared and hyped by everyone from Al\nGore to CNN talking heads was based on faulty software models that don't stand\nup to actual measured temperatures in the real world. In technical jargon, the\npaper explains, \"We show that limiting cumulative post-2015 CO2 emissions to\nabout 200 GtC would limit post-2015 warming to less than 0.6 °C in 66% of\nEarth system model members.\" In effect, the current global warming software\nmodels used by the IPCC and cited by the media wildly over-estimate the\nwarming effects of CO2 emissions. How much do they over-estimate warming? By\nabout 50%. Where the software models predicted a 1.3 C rise in average global\ntemperatures, only a rise of about 0.9 C has actually been recorded (and many\ndata points in that average have, of course, been fabricated by climate change\nscientists to push a political narrative). In other words, [carbon dioxide\nemissions](http://carbondioxide.news/) don't produce the warming effects that\nhave been blindly claimed by climate change alarmists. \"Climate change poses\nless of an immediate threat to the planet than previously thought because\nscientists got their modelling wrong,\" [reports the UK\nTelegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/09/18/immediacy-threat-\nclimate-change-exaggerated-faulty-models/). \"New research by British\nscientists reveals the world is being polluted and warming up less quickly\nthan 10-year-old forecasts predicted, giving countries more time to get a grip\non their carbon output.\" In other words, the climate change threat has been\nwildly overstated. The fear mongering of Al Gore and the government-funded\nscience community can truly only be described as a \"junk science hoax.\"\nClimate alarmists suddenly find themselves admitting they were wrong all along\n\"The paper … concedes that it is now almost impossible that the doomsday\npredictions made in the last IPCC Assessment Report of 1.5 degrees C warming\nabove pre-industrial levels by 2022 will come true,\" writes [James\nDelingpole](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/19/delingpole-\nclimate-alarmists-finally-admit-we-were-wrong-about-global-warming/). He goes\non to say: One researcher - from the alarmist side of the argument, not the\nskeptical one - has described the paper's conclusion as\n[\"breathtaking\"](http://www.cicero.uio.no/no/posts/nyheter/commentary-\ndid-15c-suddenly-get-easier) in its implications. He's right. The scientists\nwho've written this paper aren't climate skeptics. They're longstanding\nwarmists, implacable foes of climate skeptics, and they're also actually the\npeople responsible for producing the IPCC's carbon budget. Why Doctors In The\nKnow No Longer Prescribe Blood Pressure Meds In other words, this represents\nthe most massive climbdown from the alarmist camp. Are we about to see climate\nchange alarmists owning up to the fact that real-world data show their\nsoftware models to be rooted in junk science? The unraveling has begun, but\nthere is so much political capital already invested in the false climate\nchange narrative that it will take years to fully expose the depth of\nscientific fraud and political dishonesty underpinning the global warming\nhoax. Climate change software models were deliberately tweaked to paint an\nexaggerated doomsday picture in order to scare the world into compliance panic\nWhat's clear from all this is that IPCC software models were deliberately\nbiased in favor of the worst-case \"doomsday\" predictions in order to terrorize\nthe world with a fake climate change hoax. But now the [fake\nscience](http://fakescience.news/) is catching up to them, and they're getting\ncaught in their own lies. The software models, by the way, were fraudulently\nprogrammed with dishonest model \"weights\" to produce alarming warming\npredictions no matter what temperature data points were entered into the\nsystem. This is best explained [in this Natural News\narticle](https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-06-04-global-warming-hockey-stick-\ndata-founded-fraud-computer-models-hacked-to-produce-warming-trend-from-any-\ndata-set.html) which goes into great detail, covering the IPCC global warming\nsoftware modeling hoax: Hacking the IPCC global warming data The same left-\nwing media outlets that fabricated the \"Russian hacking\" conspiracy,\ncuriously, have remained totally silent about a real, legitimate hacking that\ntook place almost two decades earlier. The IPCC \"global warming\" software\nmodels, we now know, were \"hacked\" from the very beginning, programmed to\nfalsely produce \"hockey stick\" visuals from almost any data set… include\n\"random noise\" data. What follows are selected paragraphs from a fascinating\nbook that investigated this vast political and scientific fraud: [The Real\nGlobal Warming Disaster by Christopher Booker](https://www.amazon.com/Real-\nGlobal-Warming-Disaster-Scientific/dp/1441110526/)(Continuum, 2009). This book\nis also available as an audio book from Audible.com, so if you enjoy audio\nbooks, download a copy there. Here's what Booker found when he investigated\nthe \"hacking\" of the temperature data computer models: From \"The Real Global\nWarming Disaster\" by Christopher Booker: (bold emphasis added) Nothing alerted\nus more to the curious nature of the global warming scare than the peculiar\ntactics used by the IPCC to promote its orthodoxy, brooking no dissent. More\nthan once in its series of mammoth reports, the IPCC had been caught out in\nvery serious attempts to rewrite the scientific evidence. The most notorious\ninstance of this was the extraordinary prominence it gave in 2001 to the so-\ncalled 'hockey stick' graph, mysteriously produced by a relatively unknown\nyoung US scientist, which completely redrew the accepted historical record by\npurporting to show temperatures in the late twentieth century having shot\nupwards to a level far higher than had ever been known before. Although the\n'hockey stick' was instantly made the central icon of the IPCC's cause, it was\nwithin a few years to become one of the most comprehensively discredited\nartefacts in the history of science. Similarly called into serious doubt was\nthe reliability of some of the other temperature figures on which the IPCC\nbased its case. Most notably these included those provided by NASA's Goddard\nInstitute for Space Studies (GISS), run by Dr James Hansen, A1 Gore's closest\nscientific ally, which were one of the four official sources of temperature\ndata on which the IPCC relied. These were shown to have been repeatedly\n'adjusted', to suggest that temperatures had risen further and more steeply\nthan was indicated by any of the other three main data-sources. …Out of the\nblue in 1998 Britain's leading science journal Nature, long supportive of the\nwarming orthodoxy, published a new paper on global temperature changes over\nthe previous 600 years, back to 1400. Its chief author was Michael Mann, a\nyoung physicist-turned-climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts,\nwho had only completed his PhD two years before. In 1999 he and his colleagues\npublished a further paper, based only on North America but extending their\noriginal findings over 1000 years. Their computer model had enabled them to\nproduce a new temperature graph quite unlike anything seen before. Instead of\nthe previously familiar rises and falls, this showed the trend of average\ntemperatures having gently declined through nine centuries, but then suddenly\nshooting up in the twentieth century to a level that was quite unprecedented.\nIn Mann's graph such familiar features as the Mediaeval Warm Period and the\nLittle Ice Age had simply vanished. All those awkward anomalies were shown as\nhaving been illusory. The only real anomaly which emerged from their studies\nwas that sudden exponential rise appearing in the twentieth century,\nculminating in the 'warmest year of the millennium', 1998. As would eventually\nemerge, there were several very odd features about Mann's new graph, soon to\nbe known as the 'hockey stick' because its shape, a long flattish line curving\nup sharply at the end, was reminiscent of the stick used in ice hockey. But\ninitially none might have seemed odder than the speed with which this obscure\nstudy by a comparatively unknown young scientist came to be taken up as the\nnew 'orthodoxy'. So radically did the 'hockey stick' rewrite all the accepted\nversions of climate history that initially it carried all before it, leaving\nknowledgeable experts stunned. It was not yet clear quite how Mann had arrived\nat his remarkable conclusions, precisely what data he had used or what methods\nthe IPCC had used to verify his findings. The sensational new graph which the\nIPCC made the centrepiece of its report had been sprung on the world out of\nleft field. …Yet when, over the years that followed, a number of experts from\ndifferent fields began to subject Mann's two papers to careful analysis, some\nrather serious questions came to be asked about the basis for his study. For a\nstart, although Mann and his colleagues had cited other evidence for their\ncomputer modelling of historical temperatures, it became apparent that they\nhad leaned particularly heavily on 'proxy data' provided by a study five years\nearlier of tree-rings in ancient bristlecone pine trees growing on the slopes\nof California's Sierra Nevada mountains. 'Proxies' used to calculate\ntemperature consist of data other than direct measurement, such as tree rings,\nstalactites, ice cores or lake sediments. According to the 1993 paper used by\nMann, these bristlecone pines had shown significantly accelerated growth in\nthe years after 1900. But the purpose of this original study had not been to\nresearch into past temperatures. As was made clear by its title - 'Detecting\nthe aerial fertilisation effect of atmospheric C02 enrichment in tree-ring\nchronologies' - it had been to measure the effect on the trees' growth rate of\nthe twentieth-century increase in C02 levels. Tree rings are a notoriously\nunreliable reflector of temperature changes, because they are chiefly formed\nduring only one short period of the year, and cannot therefore give a full\npicture. This 1993 study of one group of trees in one untypical corner of the\nUS seemed a remarkably flimsy basis on which to base an estimate of global\ntemperatures going back 1000 years. Then it transpired that, in order to show\nthe twentieth-century section of the graph, the terrifying upward flick of\ntemperatures at the end of the 'hockey stick', spliced in with the tree-ring\ndata had been a set of twentieth-century temperature readings, as recorded by\nmore than 2,000 weather stations across the earth's surface. It was these\nwhich more than anything helped to confirm the most dramatic conclusion of the\nstudy, that temperatures in the closing decades of the twentieth century had\nbeen shooting up to levels unprecedented in the history of the last 1,000\nyears, culminating in the 'warmest year of the millennium', 1998. Not only was\nit far from clear that, for this all-important part of the graph, two quite\ndifferent sets of data had been used. Also accepted without qualification was\nthe accuracy of these twentieth-century surface temperature readings. But the\npicture given by these was already being questioned by many expert scientists\nwho pointed to evidence that readings from surface weather stations could\nbecome seriously distorted by what was known as the 'urban heat island\neffect'. The majority of the thermometers in such stations were in the\nproximity of large and increasingly built-up population centres. It was well-\nestablished that these heated up the atmosphere around them to a significantly\nhigher level than in more isolated locations. Nowhere was this better\nillustrated than by contrasting the temperature readings taken on the earth's\nsurface with those which, since 1979, had been taken by NASA satellites and\nweather balloons, using a method developed by Dr Roy Spencer, responsible for\nclimate studies at NASA's Marshall Space Centre, and Dr John Christie of the\nUniversity of Alabama, Huntsville. Surprisingly, these atmospheric\nmeasurements showed that, far from warming in the last two decades of the\ntwentieth century, global temperatures had in fact slightly cooled. As Spencer\nwas at pains to point out, these avoided the distortions created in surface\nreadings by the urban heat island effect. The reluctance of the IPCC to take\nproper account of this, he observed, confirmed the suspicion of 'many\nscientists involved in the process' that the IPCC's stance on global warming\nwas 'guided more by policymakers and politicians than by scientists'. What was\nalso remarkable about the 'hockey stick', as was again widely observed, was\nhow it contradicted all that mass of evidence which supported the generally\naccepted picture of temperature fluctuations in past centuries. As was pointed\nout, tree-rings are not the most reliable guide to assessing past\ntemperatures. Scores of more direct sources of proxy evidence had been studied\nover the years, from Africa, South America, Australia, Pakistan, Antarctica,\nevery continent and ocean of the world. Whether evidence was taken from lake\nsediments or ice cores, glaciers in the Andes or boreholes in every continent\n(Huang et ai, 1997), the results had been remarkably consistent in confirming\nthat the familiar view was right. There had been a Little Ice Age, across the\nworld. There had similarly been a Mediaeval Warm Period. Furthermore, a mass\nof data confirmed that the world had been even warmer in the Middle Ages than\nit was in 1998. The first comprehensive study to review this point was\npublished in January 2003 by Dr Willie Soon and his colleague Dr Sallie\nBaliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. They had examined\n140 expert studies of the climate history of the past 1,000 years, based on\nevery kind of data. Some had given their findings only in a local or regional\ncontext, others had attempted to give a worldwide picture. But between them\nthese studies had covered every continent. The question the two researchers\nhad asked of every study was whether or not it showed a 'discernible climate\nanomaly' at the time of (1) the Little Ice Age and (2) the Mediaeval Warm\nPeriod; and (3) whether it had shown the twentieth century to be the warmest\ntime in the Millennium. Their conclusion was unequivocal. Only two of the\nstudies they looked at had not found evidence for the Little Ice Age. Only\nseven of the 140 studies had denied the existence of a Mediaeval Warm Period,\nwhile 116 had confirmed it. On the crucial question of whether or not the\ntwentieth century had been the warmest of the past thousand years, only 15\nstudies, including that of Mann himself, had unambiguously agreed that it was.\nThe vast majority accepted that earlier centuries had been warmer. The\nconclusion of Soon and Baliunas was that 'Across the world, many records\nreveal that the twentieth century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely\nextreme climatic period of the last millennium.' But if Mann and his\ncolleagues had got the picture as wrong as this survey of the literature\nsuggested, nothing did more to expose just how this might have come about than\na remarkable feat of analysis carried out later in the same year by two\nCanadians and published in October 2003. (S. McIntyre and R. McKitrick, 2003,\n'Corrections to the Mann et al. (1998) proxy databse and northern hemispheric\naverage temperature series', Energy and Environment, 14, 752-771. In the\nanalysis of McIntyre and McKitrick's work which follows, reference will also\nbe made to their later paper, McIntyre and McKitrick, 2005b, 'The M &amp; M\ncritique of the MBH98 Northern Hemisphere climate index, Update and\napplications', Energy and Environment, 16, 69-99, and also to McKitrick\n(2005), 'What is the \"Hockey Stick\" debate about?', op. cit.) Stephen\nMcIntyre, who began their study, was a financial consultant and statistical\nanalyst specialising in the minerals industry, and was later joined by Ross\nMcKitrick, a professor of economics at Guelph University. Neither made any\npretensions to being a climate scientist, but where they did have considerable\nexpertise was in knowing how computers could be used to play around with\nstatistics. They were also wearily familiar with people using hockey sticklike\ncurves, showing an exaggerated upward rise at the end, to sell a business\nprospect or to 'prove' some tendentious point. Intrigued by the shape of the\nIPCC's now famous 'hockey stick' graph, in the spring of 2003 McIntyre\napproached Mann and his colleagues to ask for a look at their original data\nset. 'After some delay', Mann 'arranged provision of a file which was\nrepresented as the one used' for his paper. But it turned out not to include\n'most of the computer code used to produce their results'. This suggested to\nMcIntyre, who was joined later that summer by McKitrick, that no one else had\npreviously asked to examine it, as should have been required both by peer-\nreviewers for the paper published in Nature and, above all, by the IPCC\nitself. (This account of the 'hockey stick' saga is based on several sources,\nin particular Ross McKitrick's paper already cited , 'What is the \"hockey\nstick\" debate about?' (2005), and his evidence to the House of Lords Committee\non Economic Affairs, 'The Economics of Climate Change', Vol. II, Evidence,\n2005. See also David Holland, 'Bias and concealment in the IPCC Process: the\n\"Hockey Stick\" affair and its implications' (2007), op. cit.) When McIntyre\nfed the data into his own computer, he found that it did not produce the\nclaimed results. At the heart of the problem was what is known as 'principal\ncomponent analysis', a technique used by computer analysts to handle a large\nmass of data by averaging out its components, weighting them by their relative\nsignificance. One of the first things McIntyre had discovered was that the\n'principal component analysis' used by Mann could not be replicated. 'In the\nprocess of looking up all the data sources and rebuilding Mann's data set from\nscratch', he discovered 'quite a few errors concerning location labels, use of\nobsolete editions, unexplained truncations of various series etc.' (for\ninstance, data reported to be from Boston, Mass., turned out to be from Paris,\nFrance, Central England temperature data had been truncated to leave out its\ncoldest period, and so forth). But the real problem lay with the 'principal\ncomponent analysis' itself. It turned out that an algorithm had been\nprogrammed into Mann's computer model which 'mined' for hockey stick shapes\nwhatever data was fed into it. As McKitrick was later to explain, 'had the\nIPCC actually done the kind of rigorous review that they boast of they would\nhave discovered that there was an error in a routine calculation step\n(principal component analysis) that falsely identified a hockey stick shape as\nthe dominant pattern in the data. The flawed computer program can even pull\nout spurious hockey stick shapes from lists of trendless random numbers. '\n(McKitrick, House of Lords evidence, op. cit.) Using Mann's algorithm, the two\nmen fed a pile of random and meaningless data ('red noise') into the computer\n10,000 times. More than 99 per cent of the time the graph which emerged bore a\n'hockey stick' shape. They found that their replication of Mann's method\nfailed 'all basic tests of statistical significance'. When they ran the\nprogramme again properly, however, keeping the rest of Mann's data but\nremoving the bristlecone pine figures on which he had so heavily relied, they\nfound that the Mediaeval Warming once again unmistakably emerged. Indeed their\n'major finding', according to McKitrick, was that Mann's own data confirmed\nthat the warming in the fifteenth century exceeded anything in the twentieth\ncentury.44 One example of how this worked they later quoted was based on\ncomparing two sets of data used by Mann for his second 1999 paper, confined to\nproxy data from North America. One was drawn from bristlecone pines in western\nNorth America, the other from a tree ring chronology in Arkansas. In their raw\nstate, the Californian series showed a 'hockey stick' shape; the other,\ntypical of most North American tree ring series, showed an irregular but\nbasically flat line with no final upward spurt. When these were put together,\nhowever, the algorithm emphasised the twentieth-century rise by giving '390\ntimes as much weight' to the bristlecone pines as to the trees from\nArkansas.45 In other words, although Mann had used hundreds of tree ring\nproxies from all over North America, most showing a flattish line like that\nfrom Arkansas, the PCAs used to determine their relative significance had\ngiven enormously greater weight to those Californian bristlecones with their\nanomalous 'hockey stick' pattern. Furthermore, McIntyre and McKitrick found\nthat Mann had been well aware that by removing the bristlecone pine data the\n'hockey stick' shape of his graph would vanish, because he had tried it\nhimself. One of the files they obtained from him showed the results of his own\nattempt to do this. The file was marked 'Censored' and its findings were\nnowhere mentioned in the published study. What, however, concerned McIntyre\nand McKitrick as much as anything else about this extraordinary affair was\nwhat it revealed about the methods of the IPCC itself. Why had it not\nsubjected Mann's study to the kind of basic professional checks which they\nthemselves had been able to carry out, with such devastating results?\nFurthermore, having failed to exercise any proper quality control, why had\nthose at the top of the IPCC then gone out of their way to give such\nextraordinary prominence to 'the hockey stick data as the canonical\nrepresentation of the earth's climate history. Due to a combination of\nmathematical error and a dysfunctional review process, they ended up promoting\nthe exact wrong conclusion. How did they make such a blunder?'

Conclusion: The global warming \"hockey stick\" is SCIENCE\nFRAUD What all this reveals, of course, is that the global warming \"hockey\nstick\" is [fake science](http://fakescience.news/). As Booker documents in his\nbook, data were truncated (cut off) and software algorithms were altered to\nproduce a hockey stick trend out of almost any data set, including random\nnoise data. To call climate change \"science\" is to admit your own gullibility\nto science fraud. The IPCC, it turns out, used science fraud to promote global\nwarming and \"climate change\" narratives, hoping no one would notice that the\nentire software model was essentially HACKED from the very beginning,\ndeliberately engineered to produce the alarming temperature trend the world's\nbureaucrats wanted so they could terrorize the world into compliance with\n[climate change narratives](http://climatesciencenews.com/). The Russians\ndidn't hack the 2016 election, in case you were wondering. But dishonest\nscientists really did hack the global warming modeling software to deceive the\nentire world and launch a whole new brand of climate change fascism that has\nnow infected the minds of hundreds of millions of people across the planet.\nEverything they've been told about climate change, it turns, out, was all\nbased on a software hack.

While both Trump and many of his\nsupporters have applauded Arpaio, who\n[refers](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/31/us/arpaio-found-guilty/index.html) to\nhimself as \"America's toughest sheriff,\" there is one thing he is not always\ntough on--pedophiles. In fact, according to a\n[report](http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/12/04/critics_tough_sheriff_botched_sex_crime_cases/?page=full)\nfrom the Associated Press in December 2011, Airpaio's office failed to\ninvestigate\"more than 400 sex-crimes\" that were reported in Maricopa County\nfrom 2005 to 2007, \"including dozens of alleged child molestations--that were\ninadequately investigated and in some instances were not worked at all.\" The\nreport cited current and former police officers familiar with the cases who\nclaimed that victims of the horrific crimes were as young as 2 years old. In\nEl Mirage, the city where Arpaio's office was providing contract police\nservices, officials reportedly discovered at least 32 reported child\nmolestations, and even though suspects were known in all but six cases, Arpaio\n\"failed to follow through.\" While Arpaio made headlines for his infamous [Tent\nCity Jail](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/arizonas-tent-city-jail-where-\nprisoners-wear-pink-underwear-eat-meatless-meals-and-swelter-in-\nthe-120-degree-heat/article/2546924), a camp in which nearly 1,000 illegal\nimmigrants were forced to live outdoors in Arizona's sweltering 120-degree\nheat, he did not make headlines for his treatment of the children of illegal\nimmigrants. According to the officers who worked with him, many of those\nchildren were victims of sex crimes, which Arpaio ignored, as he let their\nAmerican citizen predators run free. After Arpaio's contract ended, and his\noffice was no longer required to provide police services for El Mirage,\nDetective Jerry Laird told the AP he found that an overwhelming majority of\nthe cases he received from the office hadn't been worked, which meant that\n\"there were no follow-up reports, no collection of additional forensic\nevidence and zero effort made after the initial report of the crime was\ntaken.\" While some of the cases Arpaio's office neglected were turned over to\nprosecutors, the report noted that the El Mirage Police Department claimed\n\"most were no longer viable--evidence dating as far back as 2006 had grown\ncold or wasn't collected in the first place, victims had either moved away or\notherwise moved on.\" Arpaio held a news conference in response to the 2011\nreport, in which he [said](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/us/sheriff-joe-\narpaio-criticized-over-handling-of-sex-crimes-cases.html?mcubz=1), \"If there\nwere any victims, I apologize to those victims.\" As The Free Thought Project\nhas reported, a number of cases involving pedophiles have come to light under\nthe Trump Administration, such as a pedophile ring investigation that resulted\n[over 900 arrests](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/children-saved-pedophile-\nring-busted-media-silent/) in May, and a sex-trafficking investigation that\nresulted in [over 1,000 arrests](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-\ndragnet-trafficking-1000/) earlier this month. This raises the question--why\naren't Arpaio and other members of his office being held to the same\nstandards? Joe Arpaio's harsh treatment towards illegal immigrants has stirred\nup controversy, but his outright neglect of children who are victims of sex\ncrimes seems to have slipped under the radar. Children have no control over\nwhich country they are born in, and they are the most vulnerable to predators.\nIf a child is a victim of a sex crime, the question of whether the predators\nare \"illegal aliens\" or \"legal American citizens\" should not keep officials\nlike Sheriff Arpaio from holding them accountable for their actions, and he\nshould be held accountable for his failure to do so.\n\n",

If conservative\ninvestors had any courage, this would be the time to make a hostile takeover\nof the movie business. Unfortunately, they don't. I know this from bitter\npersonal experience. Wealthy conservatives are delighted to support the\nPhilharmonic, but when it comes to popular culture they turn away, as if\nafraid to get their hands dirty. That this is a huge mistake should be\nobvious. They have abandoned the culture -- and our children -- to the\ncreepiest people imaginable. What is going on in Hollywood is far from being\njust about Harvey. It's approaching a pandemic. So many previously silent\nassaulted or raped women are coming out of the woodwork, it seems like a long-\nbelated remake of \"Cheaper by the Dozen.\" No one knows who will be next or if\nit will stop at Harvey. The rot is everywhere, even, perhaps especially, in\nthe precincts of \"high art.\" Gwyneth Paltrow says now is the time to put an\nend to these attacks on women. But where was she years ago when Harvey got\n\"handsy\" with her? Looking the other way while earning millions and garnering\nOscars. Meryl Streep claimed she was clueless about Weinstein's repulsive\nantics. Time to award her her greatest Oscar yet -- for playing someone deaf,\ndumb, and blind while living as a troglodyte in the Gobi desert. Either the\nwoman's a liar or an utter nincompoop. I'll go with the former. As for the\ngreat feminist George Clooney -- the first male star out of the box to condemn\nWeinstein's behavior -- let's give him the Nobel Prize in virtue signaling. By\ncoming forward, he was able to ace out his competition -- Howard Zinn-loving\nMatt Damon, who disgraced himself forever by covering up for Harvey a decade\nago. (For those who may have missed it in the onslaught of sleazy details,\nDamon assured then New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman that Miramax's high-\npaid Italian representative was a genuine \"creative film executive\" and not\nHarvey's European procurer, as was, evidently correctly, rumored. Damon is the\nsame \"progressive\" movie star who makes films opposing school choice for the\nmasses while living in a thirty million dollar house and sending his kids to\nprivate school. I take it back -- maybe we should give him the Nobel in virtue\nsignaling.)\n\n",

It is time to call the Chinese\ngovernment out. The U.S. economy is weakened by Chinese intellectual property\ntheft, counterfeit goods, and deficient products competing with American\nbrands. China was unwilling to help make North Korea release Otto Warmbier\nearly enough to get him medical help. In an interview on CNN Sen. Chuck\nSchumer (D-NY) the Senate Democratic Leader, told Trump how to handle China:\n\"You say, 'you can't push America around anymore,' which they've been able to\ndo for administration after administration. Stop doing that. The President\nshould say, 'You're not dealing with North Korea the way you should be.'\" On\nJune 20, Trump tweeted about Warmbier, \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts\nof President Xi &amp; China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out.\nAt least I know China tried!\" Instead, China is giving us a victory here and\nthere-- they will now import beef from us.

In an April 12 press conference right after his meetings\nwith China's leader, Trump said, \"They're not currency manipulators,\" which he\nhad called them at least fifteen times on the campaign trail. Schumer said of\nTrump and his team, \"Now they say they (China) aren't manipulating their\ncurrency. They are.

The way to get China to help with North Korea is be tougher with\nthem on trade.\" How To Easily Kill All Indoor Odor, Mold, And Bacteria --\nWithout Lifting A Finger Trump to End the Dollar as We Know It by August 1,\n2018? President Trump said that when he met with President Xi at the White\nHouse, \"After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it's not so easy. I felt\npretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [over] North Korea.\" Of\ncourse China has leverage over North Korea. North Korea depends on China as a\ntrading partner. In 10 minutes, Trump's view on China for thirty years\napparently changed with a persuasive short argument from the president of a\ncountry that continually walks all over the U.S. This was Trump listening to\nthe \"last man in the room\" at its worst. Trump said he told President Xi, \"The\nway you're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea;\notherwise we're just going to go it alone.\" The last part of that sentence is\nwhat the U.S., along with its allies, should do. China will help regardless\nbecause it's in China's own interest to do so. Not allowing China to take\nadvantage of the U.S. has been a Democratic issue for over forty years, from\nDick Gephardt to Bernie Sanders, and it became a key one for Trump too-- a\nrare area of campaign agreement. The president's promise to stand up to China\nwas one of the major reasons he won the election. China should not get a free\nride because we want their help with North Korea. In 2015, the FBI released a\nsurvey of 165 anonymous companies, half of which reported they had been\nvictims of economic espionage. Of that half, 95 percent blame China. The\ncounterfeit goods market in China costs companies $20 billion a year. Are they\nbuying us by Americans enjoying a $30 \"Rolex\" from a Times Square vendor?\nSimply put, China's illegal actions are costing American jobs. To prevent a\nnuclear North Korea, the recent U.S. deployment of the \"mother of all bombs\"\nwas as much a warning to other countries, including North Korea, as it was\nabout destroying ISIS tunnels in Afghanistan. The U.S. has military might and\nis willing to use it. North Korea knows that. It is not worth caving to China,\nwho costs the U.S. billions of dollars a year, and allowing them to keep\nmanipulating currency and committing economic espionage. Otto Warmbier's coma\nand death, and Korea's missile tests and H-bomb, are just more proof Schumer\nis right--Instead of making nice with China, President Trump must hold them\naccountable, as he promised.

However, journalist Joan Walsh cautioned Americans to take a\nlong, hard look at Trump's would-be successor Mike Pence before we get excited\nabout Pence being behind the Resolute desk in place of Trump. Wrote Walsh in\nan [article](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-mike-pence-is-worse-than-\ndonald-trump/) bluntly titled \"Why Mike Pence is Worse than Donald Trump\" in\nThe Nation, \"You probably have these debates with your friends, too: Do we\nwant Donald Trump to resign, or be impeached, which would leave us with Vice\nPresident Mike Pence in charge?…Would the low-charisma Pence, who looks like a\nB-movie producer's idea of a president, be easier to defeat, especially given\nthe GOP fratricide that would commence with Trump's departure, however it came\nabout?\" She continued, \"I try never to care about the political implications\nof whether Trump should stay or go. He should go, because he's a racist\nauthoritarian who got help from a foreign adversary to become president. He\nshould go, because he's more likely to stumble into war than Pence is. But I\nnever let that obscure the truth, either: Pence is a far worse person, because\nof his creepy Handmaid's Tale patriarchal approach to women's equality. But\nalso because he usually knows he's lying about Trump, and their\nadministration's agenda, and he lies anyway.\" Walsh then brought up disturbing\ncomments the vice president made this past week during an appearance on the\nToday show. Said Pence, protesting the removal of Confederate monuments, \"When\nI walked, back in 2010, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis, arm\nin arm, and we remembered Bloody Sunday, and the extraordinary progress of the\ncivil rights movement, I can't help but think that rather than pulling down\nmonuments, as some are wont to do, rather than tearing down monuments that\nhave graced our cities all across this country for years, we ought to be\nbuilding more monuments.\"Commented Joan about Pence, \"I don't think he gives a\ndamn about the folks who protest these shameful statues. What was most galling\nabout Pence's comment, though, was that he used his bond with Lewis to clean\nup Trump's despicable equation of Nazis and white supremacists with their\nopponents, who are the modern-day incarnation of John Lewis.\" Do you think she\nis correct about Pence?\n\n",

In a television interview broadcast on Ireland's ''Late Late\nShow'', former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate,\nHillary Clinton, opened up on the unfolding of events on election night 2016.\nPromoting her campaign memoir, 'What Happened', Clinton described the night\nand its aftermath as ''painful'' and ''so terrible''. ''I would have to go lie\ndown because it was so excruciating'', she joked to interviewer Ryan Tubridy\nin a candid conversation, filmed near her home in Chappaqua, New York. \"I was\nin a state of shock.

''We are just one day away from the change\nyou've been waiting for, for your entire life'', he told supporters on his\nfinal day of campaigning]. Whilst discussing the inauguration of President\nTrump, asked if she wanted to scream, Clinton told RTÉ, \"Oh, I did. But that\nwas a common occurrence in those days.

But to lose to someone who I believed\nprofoundly was not ready for the job, was temperamentally unqualified for the\njob - was such a burden. ''I just thought, 'I've let everybody down, I've let\nmy country down, I've let the world down. How did this happen?\" Clinton\nrecalled. Acknowledging the role of the email scandal and various shortcomings\nin her campaign, Clinton also blamed Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and\nthe propagation of ''fake news'' as factors in the election of President\nTrump. \"I knew there were these other forces at work that needed to be\nunpacked and analyzed.

The camouflaged drones Credit -\nRick Stevens Now that gold mining is not as common as it once was in the US,\nmany other countries have been exploited by gold mining firms in its absence.\nOne of these countries is Australia. Mining in Australia is a major industry\nwith gold mining in Western Australia alone [generating over $10\nbillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining_in_Western_Australia) every\nyear. However, some of the gold mines there have been experiencing a costly\nand unexpected problem as nature has apparently decided to fight back against\nits incursions. Drones that are used to survey the territory around gold mines\nare being destroyed by native wedge-tailed eagles.

After the attacks\nbegan, Steven camouflaged his drones as baby eagles. However, the ruse only\nworked temporarily as 50 flights later the eagles realized the disguised\ndrones were not what they seemed. Each of these drones costs an impressive\n$20,000, meaning that gold mining companies are losing money fast thanks to\nthe eagles' intervention. One of these companies, [Gold\nFields](https://careers.goldfields.com.au/), has already lost over $100,000.\nThis isn't the first case of animals fighting back against the degradation of\nthe environment in recent months. Less than a month ago, a herd of wild\nbuffalo appeared out of nowhere in a seeming show of support to the Native\nAmericans and their allies protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. The buffalo,\nwho are considered sacred by the Sioux tribe, appeared by the thousands in a\nstampede that interrupted a confrontation between protestors and police. After\nthe event, many speculated that the buffalo had appeared to show their\nsolidarity with the protestors and indicated that nature was fighting back\nagainst exploitative corporate practices.

Richard Durbin discusses President Trump's immigration comments following\nthe City of Chicago's 32nd Annual Interfaith Breakfast commemorating the life\nof Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on Jan. 12, 2018. (Jose M. Osorio /\nChicago Tribune) What did you say when President Donald Trump referred to\nHaiti, El Salvador and some African nations as \"shithole countries\"? What did\nyou say when the president of the United States followed that comment by\nsuggesting he'd rather see more immigrants from countries like Norway? No\ncompatible source was found for this media. Whether now or in the future, you\nwill be asked this question: What did you say? Did you call out the obvious\nracism behind those statements? Did you acknowledge that the leader of the\nfree world -- by title, anyway -- had shown himself to be a white supremacist,\ncasually expressing his dislike of brown-skinned immigrants and preference for\nwhite European immigrants? Were you outraged that such comments from a sitting\npresident were antithetical to the ideals that have always made America a\nbeacon of hope and opportunity? What did you say? Did you speak out? Did you\ndenounce the comments, as Rep. Mia Love, a Utah Republican whose parents came\nto America from Haiti, did, saying in a statement: \"This behavior is\nunacceptable from the leader of our nation. … The President must apologize to\nboth the American people and the nations he so wantonly maligned.\" Or did you\nkeep quiet? Take note, because you will be asked. Trump's has been a\npresidency filled with jaw-dropping moments of offensive behavior, but this\none will stand out over time, both for its profane nature and its naked\nracism. So what did you say? Did you look for excuses? Did you toss out a\n\"Well, what about …\" scenario you thought might take the heat off? Did you\nscream something about \"identity politics\" and try to pretend that this is the\nfault of others, not the fault of the transparently racist old man in the\nWhite House? Did you say he has a point? Did you say, \"Well, those countries\nare shitholes, aren't they?\" Did you forget how people once described\nimmigrants from Italy and Ireland? Did you forget the words on a plaque at the\nStatue of Liberty? \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses\nyearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send\nthese, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden\ndoor!\" Did you forget those words, or just ignore them? Did you smile about a\ntax break and say nothing? Did you not put the pieces together and consider\nall the other times Trump has shown us exactly who he is? Did you tamp down\nmemories of his calls for the execution of the Central Park Five, even after\nthe young men, four black and one Latino, were found innocent? Did you explain\naway what Trump was implying in this tweet from 2013: \"According to Bill\nO'Reilly, 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add\nHispanics, that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.\" Did you disregard his years-\nlong birther crusade against the nation's first black president? His\ndescription of Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals? His regular\ncriticism that immigrants coming from predominately nonwhite nations are\nexamples of those countries' \"worst people\"? Did you not let yourself see the\npattern? Did you twist logic into knots and blame it on the media? On\npolitical correctness? What did you say when our president called other\ncountries \"shitholes\" and you had to shield your children's ears from\nprofanity on the nightly news? What did you tell your children about this\nmoment? How did you explain the president's words? Tell me, what did you say?\nMark it down, let it be known. Because you will be asked this again someday.\nAnd if you stayed silent, if you made excuses, if you tried to fool yourself\ninto believing this is appropriate presidential behavior, if you let it slide\nbecause this presidency might somehow line your pocketbook, then you will be\nremembered as complicit, as one who stood by and let America's decency get\ndragged through the mud. And if you laughed, or if you smiled, or if you\nnodded your head in agreement, you will be remembered just as Trump will: as a\nracist, a fool and an absolute embarrassment. rhuppke@chicagotribune.com\nRELATED President Trump owes the country an apology » What happened when I\nfollowed Trump's example and started lying all the time » Trump attacks\nprotections for immigrants from 'shithole' countries in Oval Office meeting »\n\n",

Sure sounds like a fully-automatic weapon which is one of the\nmost tightly controlled weapon categories in the country. A background check,\npermission from law enforcement, and national registration are just some of\nthe hurdles one would have to go through to buy a weapon like this legally.\nThat doesn't even touch on the massive expense of buying a legal full-auto\nfirearm following the 1986 machine gun ban. Weapons like that run tens of\nthousands of dollars, which means that alone keeps them out of most folks'\nhands. But that won't stop the anti-gun left. Nope.

Let me make this very clear to the leftists out there: This maniac used\none of the most tightly controlled and regulated firearms in the country, one\nthat requires every hoop imaginable to get your hands on legally, and killed\ndozens and wounded hundreds. Do you really think there's anything that would\nhave stopped this from happening? Anything at all? Especially since there are\nso many questions we don't have answers to. His brother [claims he had no\npolitical affiliations](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4940800/Las-\nVegas-shooter-s-brother-says-family-dumbfounded.html), but that seems unlikely\nin this day and age. However, we still don't know for sure. Maybe he was an\nodd duck these days and didn't care. Who knows. To be sure, there's plenty of\nspeculation going on. I'm not immune to it, though I won't divulge my\nspeculation publicly just now. However, speculation is just something people\ndo to pass the time until we have actual facts, which are severely lacking at\nthe moment. What matters right now is to do whatever we can to help those who\nhave been hurt by this tragedy, either by losing someone they care about,\nphysically wounded in the assault, or legitimately traumatized by what they've\nbeen through. There are victims here, and they need our love and support far\nmore than our wild theories about what has taken place in Las Vegas. My heart\nand prayers go out to all the victims and their families, as do my wife's and\nchildren's. I know I'm not alone in this, and while this is something that\nshould unify us in solidarity if only for a few moments, it's a shame that it\nwon't.\n\n",

Thank\nYOU!\n********************************************************************************\nWhile North Korea dominated much of the news of late and the recent events in\nCharlottesville, VA have been the talk of the internet over the last couple of\ndays, the recent revelation of the \"Memo that rocked Washington,\" which\nexposes the deep state subversion against President Trump and explaining the\ntactics being utilized, is being spun as \"crazy\" with the writer of the memo\nbeing labeled a \"nutcase\" by the MSM, who has converged on a narrative in a\nweak attempt at damage control. The memo is embedded in full below, so readers\ncan read the seven-page memorandum produced in May by the former director of\nstrategic planning at the National Security Council, Rich Higgins. Before we\ndetail some of the highlights from the memo, then offer the document in full,\nlets take a [look at Higgins credentials](http://freebeacon.com/national-\nsecurity/fired-nsc-aide-reveals-political-warfare-operation-targeting-trump/),\nthe man that the media is doing their best to discredit with labels like\nnutcase (MediaIte) with outlets like Washington Post calling the memo itself\n\"crazy.\" Not only was Higgins the the former director of strategic planning\nfor the NSC, before being fired by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster for writing the\nmemorandum, but perhaps more impressive, the Army veteran was also a former\nPentagon official who specialized in irregular warfare. [Department of Defense\ndefines Irregular Warfare in a 100 page document from\n2007](http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/concepts/joint_concepts/joc_iw_v1.pdf), in\nthe following manner: Irregular warfare (IW) is defined as a violent struggle\namong state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant\npopulations. IW favors indirect and asymmetric approaches, though it may\nemploy the full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an\nadversary's power, influence, and will. It is inherently a protracted struggle\nthat will test the resolve of our Nation and our strategic partners. Our\nadversaries will pursue IW strategies, employing a hybrid of irregular,\ndisruptive, traditional, and catastrophiccapabilities to undermine and erode\nthe influence and will of the United States and our strategic partners.\nMeeting these challenges and combating this approach will require the\nconcerted efforts of all available instruments of US national power.\nInfluencing foreign governments and populations is a complex and inherently\npolitical activity. This Joint Operating Concept (JOC) describes the military\nrole in protracted IW campaigns; however, these campaigns will fail if waged\nby military means alone. The nature of IW requires the US Government (USG) to\nachieve the level of unified action necessary to integrate all available\ninstruments of national power to address irregular threats. The USG will have\nto develop \"Whole of Government\" approaches to waging IW at the political,\nstrategic, operational, and tactical levels. Other government agencies must\nbuild their capacity to operate in unstable or hostile environments.\nRevolutionary Hearing Aid Is Now Giving Free Fit &amp; Feel Samples Irregular\nwarfare is about people, not platforms. IW depends not just on our military\nprowess, but also our understanding of such social dynamics as tribal\npolitics, social networks, religious influences, and cultural mores. People,\nnot platforms and advanced technology, will be the key to IW success. The\njoint force will need patient, persistent, and culturally savvy people to\nbuild the local relationships and partnerships essential to executing IW. So a\nman that specialized in irregular warfare tactics for the Pentagon, writes a\nseven-page memo which details a plot to overthrow the President of the United\nStates, by globalist members of the deep state, with the intentional help of\npropaganda being fed to the media in order to influence the public, using\ntactics he was responsible for observing while at the Pentagon in order to\nsave American militarylives, and the media starts screaming \"nutcase,\" and\n\"crazy,\" and \"conspiracy theory!\" Something doesn't smell right here. MEMO\nTHAT ROCKED THE NSC &amp; SENT THE MSM INTO DAMAGE CONTROL MODE The memo is\ntitled \"POTUS &amp; Political Warfare,\" and starts off detail some background\non the \"information campaigns designed to first undermine, then delegitimize\nand ultimately remove the President,\" calling it \"political warfare at an\nunprecedented level that is openly engaged in the direct targeting of a seated\npresident through manipulation of the news cycle.\" While naming the actors,\nsuch as the media, Democrats, establishment Republicans, and explaining what\neach gains in their political warfare campaign against the president, it is on\nPage 5 of the document embedded below, where Higgins detailed the \"Adversary\nCampaign Plan,\" in the following manner: Adversary Campaign Plan. Political\nWarfare has been described as \"propaganda in battledress.\" The effort directed\nat President Trump is executed along one overt, as well as two covert, lines\nof effort: • The overt line of effort is PUBLICITY. Publicity is the\nstraightforward projection of a case that builds a picture in the audience's\nmind designed to garner support. It is facts without context and information\nthe adversary wants the audience to possess that creates an impression and\nsets conditions. It seeks to establish good will and receptiveness to\nadditional inputs. • There are two covert lines of effort: PROPOGANDA and\nINFILTRATION/SUBVERSION. o Propaganda is the deliberate direction, even\nmanipulation, of information to secure a definite outcome. It is an attempt to\ndirect the thinking of the recipient, without his conscious collaboration,\ninto predetermined channels that are established in the Publicity line of\neffort. It is the unwitting conditioning of the recipient by devious methods\nwith an ulterior motive that seeks to move them incrementally over time into\ngreater belief and acceptance of message transmitted in the Publicity line of\neffort. o Infiltration and subversion operate internal to the targeted\norganization in order to inform, target, coordinate, and amplifythe effects of\nthe publicity and propaganda. Both operate to gather intelligence, obstruct\nlegitimate courses of action, provide inside information, and leak sensitive\ninformation that undermines the leadership and suppresses the morale of\nfriendly elements. o Infiltration of political and social groups within a\ntarget state is done for the purpose of extending counter-state influence and\ncontrol. The endgame is concealed and may involve illicit activities. o\nSubversion undermines or detaches the loyalties of significant political and\nsocial groups within the target state and transfers political and/or\nideological loyalties to the counter-state. As thcounter-state forms, a\ncounter-elite of influential individual and key leaders within the target\nstate will later facilitate the legitimacy and permanency of the new regime.\nOn page #6 we see \"Political Warfare Executive - The Meaning, Techniques and\nMethods of Political Warfare,\" which accurately captures what we at\n[ANP](http://allnewspipeline.com/Read_NSC_Memo_That_Exposes_Globalist_Plot.php)\nhave been documenting and reporting on for years, including how the media is\nbeing used to deliberately push \"pseudo-realities,\" in a campaign to\n\"delegitimize President Trump,\" with preferred narratives including the\n\"Russia hacked the election\", \"Obstruction of Justice\", \"Hiding Collusion\",\nand \"Putin Puppet.\" As is explained, each of these \"pseudo-realities,\" is\ngeared toward a specific propaganda point, the first an attempt to push the\n\"illegitimate\" narrative, the second to push the \"corrupt\" narrative,\" the\nthird to push the \"dishonest\" narrative and the last to push the idea of\n\"treason.\" Supporting Narratives. Meta-narratives are supported by an ongoing\nseries of supporting-narratives that can be swapped out as circumstances\nwarrant. It is important to recognize that these stories do not have to be\ntrue, valid or accurate to serve their purpose. Over time, deserved or not,\nthe cumulative effect of these supporting narratives will result in a Trump\nfatigue. From a political warfare perspective, President Trump's inability to\nmeet this challenge will cast him as a weak failed leader. The entire memo is\nembedded below, read it and decide for yourself. Below the memo we analyze why\na man that specialized in irregular warfare for the Pentagon, was fired by\nMcMasters for detailing what many in the Independent Media have been\ndocumenting since Trump won the election. WHY WAS HIGGINS FIRED? We have\nlargely refrained from weighing in on H.R. McMasters, despite the fact that\nhis stances on Iran, Islamic Terrorism, the Paris Accord, were more in line\nwith Obama policy than President Trump's policy, where in each case McMasters\nlost his argument and the President aligned himself with the promises made,\nkeeping them rather than allowing McMasters to influence his decisions, but\n[according to recent reports](http://www.breitbart.com/big-\ngovernment/2017/08/12/mcmaster-detonated-over-memo-that-warned-of-political-\nwarfare-effort-against-trump/), the second McMasters saw this internal memo,\nhe \"detonated,\" and then proceeded to fire the man that wrote it. The memo was\nwritten in May, but after McMaster discovered it, Higgins was called into the\nWhite House counsel's office on July 18 and questioned about it. On July 21,\nhe was fired by McMaster's deputy, but not explicitly given a reason why. As\nto McMasters stances on a variety of issues that do not align with the\npresident's base, that can be chalked up to \"politics\" as Trump the\nbusinessman was well known for hiring people with opposing views as to look at\nall angles before making his decisions, it was not surprising in the least\nthat he brought McMasters on. The firing of the director of strategic planning\nfor the NSC on the other hand, for utilizing his experience in known irregular\nwarfare methods for and tactics for the Pentagon, to warn of a campaign\nagainst a sitting president by multiple factions, including globalists, deep\nstate members within the intelligence community, and the media, forces us to\nask the question of whether McMasters is part of the \"political warfare\"\ncampaign against President Trump? That is a question President Trump should be\nasking. BOTTOM LINE The fact that the media was called out directly in the\nmemo, highlighting the part they play in pushing \"pseudo-realities,\" in order\nto generate a narrative to influence the general public, explains clearly why\nthey are in all-out damage control mode trying to discredit the writer of the\nNSC memo that rocked Washington, because he just publicly exposed them all.\nThe fact that the media, Trump haters, neverTrumpers, establishment\nRepublicans, and Democrats are all supporting McMasters, also begs the\nquestion: Is he one of the enemy within? The fact that he fired a man trying\nto protect the president from other enemies within, might be the answer to\nthat question.

            "input": "I am writing this article for an audience consisting of all the good people\nwho, like myself, sincerely want a more equal and democratic society and who\n(unlike myself), to achieve this goal, look for leadership from the prominent\nindividuals and organizations that seem to share this goal. Most of these\nleaders are commonly identified either as \"of the Left\" or \"progressive\" or\n\"liberal\" or \"Marxist.\" In this article I will refer to all of these prominent\nleaders as \"the Left.\" According to the standard wisdom, the Left is providing\ngood leadership to achieve a more equal and democratic society and the problem\nis that not enough people follow this leadership, and so the enemies of the\nLeft (led by what I call the ruling class) remain in power. The problem, in\nthis mistaken view, is that the Left is weak. What I will show is that, on the\ncontrary, the problem (for those who want a more equal and democratic society,\nthat is) is that the Left is wrong. What do I mean? The Left is wrong in its\nfundamental view of ordinary people, and because of this wrong view the ruling\nclass is able to use the Left to divide and rule good people. So let's start\nby seeing what's wrong with the Left's view of ordinary people. The Left's\nWrong View of Ordinary People Before discussing the Left's wrong view it helps\nto say what the truth is about ordinary people. The truth is that the vast\nmajority of ordinary people (in the world, and in the United States as well)\nwant society to be based on the positive values of concern for one another (as\nopposed to dog-eat-dog competition), mutual aid (as opposed to some people\ntaking unfair advantage of others) and equality (in the sense of having no\nrich and no poor and in the sense of ordinary people rather than a privileged\nand self-serving elite having the real say in social decisions.) This is why\nordinary people are the solution, not the problem, today. The Left disagrees.\nThe Left views the majority of ordinary people as the problem, not the\nsolution, because their supposed values are the problem: selfishness and\ngreed, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and the list grows all the\ntime. The Left believes that certain subsets of ordinary people (people of\ncolor, non-heterosexuals, transgender people, etc.) are oppressed by the\nordinary people who are different. The solution, in this Leftist view, is to\npersuade the oppressive ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values.\nThe Marxist Left (which I have written about\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/revolution/socialism.html)) sometimes adds\nto the above an emphasis, more than the liberal/progressive leftists, on the\nissue of class: the material oppression of the working class by the capitalist\nclass. The Marxist Left thus, sharing the liberal/progressive left's negative\nview of the deplorable values of ordinary people, points out that despite\ntheir terrible values working class people nonetheless have a class interest\nin opposing the ruling class. The solution according to the Marxist Left is,\nagain, to persuade ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values (or,\nas the Marxists would say, to \"become class conscious.\") The idea that the\nvalues of the vast majority of ordinary people are the solution, not the\nproblem--that they are the values that ought to shape society and are the\nopposite of the terrible values of the ruling class--is the truthful idea that\nwill enable good people to succeed in building a huge popular movement to make\nsociety genuinely equal and democratic. (A wonderful entire book about this is\nonline\n[here](http://www.newdemocracyworld.org/old/Revolution/We%20Can%20Change%20the%20World%20book.pdf).)\nBut hardly anybody knows how true this idea is, thanks to the ruling class\npropaganda against it and also thanks to the Left's rejection of it. Perhaps\nyou, dear reader, think this idea is false. If so, please read (\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/right.html)) about my experience\nat a pro-Trump rally asking random people there if they thought it was a good\nidea or a bad idea to \"remove the rich from power to have real, not fake,\ndemocracy with no rich and no poor.\" 86% of them (43 out of the 50 I asked)\nthought it was a good (or great!) idea and those 43 people all gladly took my\nbutton with that message and many pinned it onto themselves right on the spot.\nConsider this please. If ordinary people were as selfish and vile as the Left\nclaims, then our world would be infinitely more horrible than it actually is,\nwith everybody stabbing each other in the back and nobody giving a damn about\nanybody else. This is the kind of world that it would be--a veritable hellish\nnightmare of a world--if the disgusting selfish competitive values of the\nruling class were also those of everybody else. The fact that our world is not\nthis hellish nightmare, but one in which most people cooperate and help each\nother and respect one another as equals in countless ways that we take so much\nfor granted that we don't think about them or even notice them, this fact has\nhuge significance: it shows that most ordinary people are the positive force\nin the world, a force that challenges capitalist values and that ought to\nshape all of society. How the Ruling Class USES the Left to Divide and Rule Us\nI have written a whole [book](https://www.amazon.com/NO-RICH-POOR-\nBook/dp/B073D876VD/ref%3Dsr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507566486&sr=1-5&keywords=spritzler)(Divide\nand Rule) about how the ruling class uses the Left to divide and rule us. What\nfollows is a brief summary with some links to some of my online articles\ntreating particular issues in more detail. Here's how the ruling class uses\nthe Left for divide-and-rule. The ruling class takes (or invents) a \"hot\nbutton\" (i.e., potentially very divisive social issue) and, with its control\nof the mainstream (and alternative!) media, it imposes a very particular\nframework on the public debate about the issue. The framework is designed to\nbe maximally divisive. The framework is made maximally divisive by defining\ntwo opposing views (I call them \"camps\") in a way that ensures that the people\nin each camp--when they hear about the opposing camp--will view the members of\nthe opposing camp with utter contempt and possibly fear. The ruling class does\nthis by a) providing each camp's position with arguments designed to be\nmaximally offensive to the other camp, and b) censoring facts that, if known,\nwould cause people in the opposing camps to see that they had far more\nagreement with each other than they otherwise would realize, and that the\nconcerns of the opposing camp were quite reasonable (instead of deplorable)\neven if they still disagreed. Here are some examples of how the ruling class\nuses the Left to make this work. How To Easily Kill 98% Of Mold In Your Home\nRace The truth is that a) the ruling class for centuries has systematically\ndiscriminated against people not of European descent (\"whites\") and b) the\nruling class did this in order to more effectively dominate, control and\noppress working class people of ALL races. The early British big property\nowners in the Virginia Colony instituted slavery based on race because they\nfeared that otherwise there would be more rebellions of the working class\n(laborers in the tobacco plantations of both African and European descent)\nunited regardless of race, as happened in Bacon's Rebellion in 1676--a\nrebellion that almost overthrew the British ruling elite. (Read more about\nthis [here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/race.html).) The truth is\nthat when the ruling class singles out some working class people for harsher\ntreatment than others, it is for the purpose of creating mutual mistrust,\nresentment and fear between those singled out for special discrimination and\nthe others. Thus the racist Jim Crow laws in the South not only harmed blacks;\nthey also harmed the poor whites, whose wages were lower than white wages in\nthe North because Jim Crow prevented them from having strong (i.e.,\nintegrated) unions and diverted their anger at blacks instead of the wealthy\nwhites who oppressed them. The truth is that, among working class people, AN\nINJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL. But the Left disagrees. The Left asserts\nexactly what the ruling class also asserts: that racial discrimination against\nnon-whites benefits white working class people. The ruling class asserted that\nslavery and Jim Crow benefited poor whites and the Left chimes right in by\nasserting that white working class people enjoy \"white privilege\" (the word\n\"privilege\" means, by definition, a benefit). The Left never says that racial\ndiscrimination against non-whites also HARMS white working class people. The\nruling class promotes (with its foundations) the use of \"white privilege\"\nrhetoric (as I show in great detail\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/white.html)) and counts on the\nLeft not explaining (as I do\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/privilege.html)) that \"white\nprivilege\" is a phrase designed to hide the truth that AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN\nINJURY TO ALL. On the contrary, the Left is largely responsible for the sad\nfact that young people today use the horribly misleading phrase \"white\nprivilege\" to refer to what the Martin Luther King, Jr. Civil Rights Movement\nreferred to with the very good phrase \"racial discrimination.\" The result is\nthat working class people are being effectively divided and ruled along race\nlines, as I discuss\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/recruit2.html). Earlier, the\nruling class promoted Affirmative Action to divide and rule us along race\nlines, as I discuss in more detail\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/affirmative.html). (Please read\nthis short linked article if you believe that Affirmative Action was truly\nabout helping non-white minority people. It was not!) Affirmative Action was\nthe flip side of the coin of the New Jim Crow of racist prison incarceration;\nboth were launched in the 1970s by the same ruling class. The New Jim Crow of\nracist prison incarceration was designed to make whites fear blacks and\nHispanics as \"a criminal race\"; Affirmative Action was designed to make white\nworking class people fear blacks and Hispanics as job-stealers, by making sure\nthat whites applying for a job or school admission would be told essentially,\n\"We're sorry, we couldn't give you the position you applied for because we had\nto give it to a less qualified minority person.\" Did the Left expose\nAffirmative Action for the divisive strategy it was? Did the Left fight for\nthe kind of reforms that would truly remedy the harm of past racial\ndiscrimination and also gain large white working class support (as my above\nlinked article discusses)? No! the Left accused white working class people who\nvery understandably objected to the new government-mandated racial\ndiscrimination of being racists. The ruling class thus used the Left to ensure\nthat its divide and rule strategy would be maximally effective. Feminism In\nthe 1970s the ruling class hijacked the traditional feminist movement (that\nstrove for equality of men and women under the law and in the workplace) and\nreplaced its leadership with a new breed of radical feminists who asserted\nthat our society was one in which men--all men, by virtue of being male--were\nthe oppressor class oppressing all women; that men, in other words, were the\nenemy--the patriarchy. The ruling class defined \"being a progressive feminist\"\nas subscribing to this \"men are the enemy\" belief. It was pure divide-and-\nrule. I discuss this at some length in my article\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/misandry.html). The Left\ncompletely agreed with the ruling class's \"men are the enemy\" theme and\naccused those who disagreed of being sexist. Just as with racial\ndiscrimination, there is real discrimination against women, but it harms\nworking class men as well because, as discussed above, AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN\nINJURY TO ALL. The Left, however, never explained this and in fact rejected\nit. The result, thanks in large part to the Left, is that ordinary people feel\nthat their only choice here is either to a) agree that all men are the enemy\nor else b) dismiss any effort to end discrimination against women as an attack\non men. Same-sex Marriage Believe it or not, there is a position on same-sex\nmarriage that would be agreeable to most people in the pro- same-sex marriage\ncamp and ALSO to most people in the anti-same-sex marriage camp. I write about\nthis position [here](https://www.pdrboston.org/conception-of-children-1); it's\na position that addresses the actual concerns of both camps. You've most\nlikely never heard of this position because the ruling class didn't want it to\nbe known; the ruling class wanted each camp on this issue to view the other as\ndespicable. The Left went right along with the ruling class in this regard,\nleading in the campaign to demonize anybody opposed to same-sex marriage as a\ndespicable bigot or idiotic Bible fundamentalist. The divisiveness on this\nissue is so thorough that many people cannot even imagine joining with people\nin the opposing camp to fight together for anything, such as making our\nsociety more equal and democratic. Thanks largely to the Left. Abortion As I\ndiscuss in some detail\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/abortion.html), the ruling class\nhas cleverly, and dishonestly, framed the abortion issue as one in which one\nside is against murder and wants women to suffer, and the other side doesn't\nwant women to suffer and has no problem with murder whatsoever. Again, as with\nsame-sex marriage, there is a position on abortion (discussed in my linked\narticle above) that would gain the respect of most people in both the pro- and\nanti-abortion camps. But the ruling class censors this position, and the Left\nhelps to censor it. The Left simply accuses people opposed to abortion of\nbeing deplorable. This is exactly what the ruling class counts on to make its\ndivide-and-rule strategy work. Muslim Refugees Key Fact: The ruling class, as\nI discuss in detail [here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/muslim-\nrefugees.html), makes sure that there are domestic acts (or almost acts) of\n\"Muslim\" terrorism so that many Americans will be terrified of Muslims. The\nruling class then promotes a great debate about whether to allow or not allow\nMuslim refugees to enter the country. The camp in favor of not allowing them\nin accuses the opposing camp of being, at best, suicidal idiots. The camp in\nfavor of allowing the refugees in (which the Left is a prominent part of)\naccuses the opposing camp of being inhumane racists. The Left is silent about\nthe Key Fact. This makes the divide-and-rule work perfectly. Immigration Key\nFact: The ruling class for a long time has been forcing large numbers ordinary\npeople in Mexico and Central America to migrate to the United States\nillegally, as I discuss\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/work/realistic_solution_immigration.html)\nand [here](https://www.pdrboston.org/illegal-immigration). Because most people\ndo not understand this key fact, the ruling class is able to orchestrate a big\nand extremely divisive debate about whether the illegal immigrants should be\nallowed to remain or not (not about whether the ruling class that forced them\nto come to the U.S. illegally should be removed from power, mind you, a\nposition that would unite most of the people in both camps, not to mention the\nillegal migrants themselves!) Does the Left tell people about the Key Fact?\nNo. It just accuses the people who want to deport the illegal aliens of being\ndeplorable racists. While the ruling class and its right-wing radio talk show\nhosts exaggerate the harm to American citizens caused by the massive illegal\nimmigration, there are in fact ways that this massive influx of people either\ndirectly causes--or is used as a pretext by the ruling class to cause--harm to\nworking class American citizens. The Left ignores this fact (also discussed in\nmy linked article above) and simply accuses anybody who supports deporting\nillegal immigrants of being motivated by racism or selfishness. This is\nexactly what the ruling class needs to make its divide-and-rule strategy work.\nHow To Easily Kill All Indoor Odor, Mold, And Bacteria -- Without Lifting A\nFinger Trump to End the Dollar as We Know It by August 1, 2018? Transgender\nBathrooms Key Fact: In most states (including North Carolina with its infamous\nHB2 law), a person can have the gender on their birth certificate changed\nsimply by providing documentation that they had sex-change surgery. As I\ndiscuss in some detail [here](https://www.pdrboston.org/bathroom-policy-re-\ntransgender), the transgender bathroom issue is phony from the git-go. The\nstatus quo (prior to this becoming a big issue) regarding bathroom use was not\noppressive to, or even viewed as oppressive by, transgender people. The\nsupposedly bigoted North Carolina HB2 law is not oppressive to transgender\npeople because of the Key Fact. But NPR (etc.) censored the Key Fact so that\nits liberal audience, hearing about the HB2 law and being told that it was\noppressive, would believe this lie, and view those who opposed the new liberal\nbathroom legislation (which truly IS oppressive) as bigots. The Left, as to be\nexpected, eagerly accuses people of being transphobic bigots if they think\nthat a woman in a public access shower room should be able to tell a person\nentering that room who has male genitalia to leave. (The new liberal laws are\nbased on exactly this absurd notion!) What more could the ruling class ask\nfrom the Left than to accuse perfectly good and decent people with a perfectly\ncommon-sense opinion of being bigots? Israel The ruling class-imposed\nframework for debating U.S. support for Israel is this: \"One camp is not anti-\nSemitic and therefore supports Israel, and the opposing camp is anti-Semitic\nand therefore does not support Israel.\" I have written in detail\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/old/War/Lobby2.htm)(including the \"must\nread\" article it links to under the title) about why this framework is\nabsolutely false. Some people in the Left support Israel and falsely accuse\nthe other camp of being anti-Semitic, and some other people in the Left do not\nsupport Israel (they may support the BDS campaign). Many of the people in the\nLeft who do not support Israel use an argument that many people perceive as an\nanti-Semitic argument; this only helps the ruling class maintain its false\nframework for divide and rule. The argument that many on the Left use and\nwhich is perceived to be anti-Semitic is this: \"The Israel lobby controls the\nAmerican ruling class so effectively that it forces America's rulers, against\ntheir will, to go against their own (our own) national interest and support\nIsrael.\" This theory is often known as \"tail wags dog\" (the Israeli tail wags\nthe United States dog) and its proponents use phrases such as \"Congress is\nIsraeli-occupied territory.\" As I discuss in my article linked to above, the\n\"tail wags dog\" theory is factually wrong, and is able to derive credibility\n(with difficulty since people know that tails don't wag dogs) only from the\nanti-Semitic canard that Jews have some mysterious power to control non-Jews\n(an idea famously espoused by the fraudulent and infamous document named \"The\nProtocols of the Elders of Zion\"). The result of the Left's role in the debate\nabout Israel is that the false framework (that it's anti-Semites versus non-\nanti-Semites) remains reinforced by the Left, much to the delight of the\nruling class. What Will It Take to Win? In order for good people to win a\ngenuinely equal and genuinely democratic society we must build a movement of\nthe great majority of Americans that explicitly aims for an egalitarian\nrevolutionary goal: to remove the ruling plutocracy from power to have no rich\nand no poor, with real democracy--not the fake democracy that will always be\nthe case as long as our society is one in which money is power and the\nbillionaires have virtually all of it. To create this movement it is necessary\nthat its leaders know and assert that the great majority of Americans share\nthis positive goal, despite secondary disagreements that the ruling class\ntries to maximize. And it is necessary that its leaders explicitly advocate\nthe egalitarian revolutionary goal, because otherwise it will never be\nadequately fought for and the ruling class will co-opt the movement with\ngimmicks (such as campaign finance reform) that leave it in power. The problem\nis that our current leaders in the Left do not believe that the great majority\nof Americans share the positive values that ought to shape society. They\nbelieve that about half of Americans are actually oppressors, and that\nordinary Americans in general have quite negative values that first need to be\nchanged before it would even be a good idea for them to have the real power in\na genuine democracy. The Left consequently does not even try to build the kind\nof movement that it takes to make a genuinely equal and democratic society,\nand it actually helps (intentionally or not, it doesn't matter) the ruling\nclass to divide-and-rule us. I have written in my book, [NO RICH AND NO\nPOOR](https://www.amazon.com/NO-RICH-POOR-\nBook/dp/B073D876VD/ref%3Dsr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507566486&sr=1-5&keywords=spritzler),\nand on my website ( [www.PDRBoston.org](http://www.pdrboston.org/)) about\nbuilding a movement--an egalitarian revolutionary movement--that can win what\nmost people want. Part of what is required is that we dump the Left. The Left\nincludes politicians such as President Obama and other\n[leaders](http://newdemocracyworld.org/revolution/sanders.html) of the\n[Democratic](http://newdemocracyworld.org/revolution/warren4.html) Party,\npundits such as [Robert\nReich](http://newdemocracyworld.org/revolution/reich.html), and virtually all\nof the Marxist organizations and individuals. (The links in the previous\nsentence are to my articles explaining what is wrong with these people.) The\nMarxists demonstrated their (to be kind) worthlessness in the way they\nresponded to one of the most divisive actions of the Left. In 2015 a couple\ndozen Leftists blocked mainly white suburban\n[commuters](http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2015/01/boston_area_highway_blocked_by_protesters)\non [I-93](http://www.wbur.org/2015/01/15/photos-boston-protests-93-traffic) in\nMassachusetts to deliberately piss them off, all in the name of \"anti-racism.\"\nThe message was that white working class people are the enemy of the anti-\nracist movement, the beneficiaries of \"white privilege.\" This is exactly the\ndivide-and-rule message that the ruling class promotes, and has been promoting\nsince the days of slavery. The leaders we need would have sharply denounced\nthis action as a disgusting attack on working class people and an act that\nsent the ruling class's Big Lie message. Practically all-ordinary people\n(except for hard core Leftists) understood it to be a disgusting attack on\ninnocent people, and they were pissed. Many Left writers and organizations\n(see [here](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/01/15/declaring-black-lives-\nmatter-protesters-stage-direct-action-blocking-boston-highway) and\n[here](http://www.openmediaboston.org/content/one-lesson-boston-highway-\nblockades-progressives-must-organize-suburbs-3073) and\n[here](https://www.popularresistance.org/how-boston-activists-shut-down-i-93/)\nand [here](http://www.workers.org/articles/2015/02/02/despite-historic-\nblizzard-bus-drivers-pack-court-for-union-militant/) and\n[here](http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/to-the-people-complaining-\nabout-the-inconvenience-of-the-highway-shutdowns-hesaid/) and\n[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/2smrqh/i93_demonstrators_issue_statement/)\nand [here](http://www.occupyboston.org/2015/01/15/i93-shutdown/) and\n[here](http://socialistworker.org/2015/02/04/blacklivesmatter-looks-ahead) for\nexample), however, praised (either explicitly or by reporting it uncritically\nas an \"anti-racist\" action) the I-93 blockade action, and those that did not\nexplicitly praise it refused to say it was a bad thing to do (see\n[here](http://www.cc-ds.org/2015/01/a-report-and-a-reflection-on-a-weekend-of-\nanti-racist-action-boston-martin-luther-king-day-protest-january-2015/) and\n[here](http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Massachusetts-Labor-Solidarity-\nNewsletter.html?soid=1117731406688&aid=6N-X-Iq-ZBM) and\n[here](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=442176882582632&story_fbid=613376482129337)\nfor example). No Left writers or organizations that I am aware of have said it\nwas a bad thing to do. The Left is perfectly fine with attacking white working\nclass people in the name of black working class people. This is how the Left,\nwittingly or not, foments race war in the U.S.A. The reason good people are\nlosing the fight against the ruling class is because we are following leaders\nwho are actually our foes. The Ruling Class and the Bolsheviks Were Allied\nfrom the Beginning The notion that the Marxist Left is working to end the\ninequality and fake democracy so loved by the capitalist ruling class has been\nwrong for a very long time. As an example of how long this notion has been\nwrong, here's an interesting fact reported in Antony Sutton's book, Wall\nStreet and the Bolshevik Revolution, published in 1974 (and online\n[here](https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Sutton_Wall_Street_and_the_bolshevik_revolution-5.pdf)),\nfrom which one excerpt about a [William Boyce\nThompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Boyce_Thompson) is given\nbelow. Thompson was at the very top of the American capitalist class when the\nBolsheviks were in the process of taking power in Russia. Thompson was\n[President](https://www.raabcollection.com/warren-harding-autograph/harding-\nsends-former-pres-federal-reserve-bank-diplomatic-mission) of the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York (the most important bank in the Federal Reserve\nsystem) from [1914 to\n1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Boyce_Thompson), the years about\nwhich Sutton writes. Thompson was a very wealthy mining magnate and he was\nprominent in the Republican party, as one can read about in the first linked\narticle about him above. Here's what Sutton reports: Alzheimer's-Blocking\n\"Super Coffee\" May Be The \"Memory Saving Discovery\" Of The Century The\nMysterious \"Secret Stock\" - It Could Fund Your Retirement How To Easily Kill\n98% Of Mold In Your Home \"Thompson's contribution to the Bolshevik cause was\nrecorded in the contemporary American press. The Washington Post of February\n2*, 1918, carried the following paragraphs: GIVES BOLSHEVIKI A MILLION W. B.\nThompson, Red Cross Donor, Believes Party Misrepresented. New York, Feb. 2\n(1918). William B. Thompson, who was in Petrograd from July until November\nlast, has made a personal contribution of $1,000,000 to the Bolsheviki for the\npurpose of spreading their doctrine in Germany and Austria. Mr. Thompson had\nan opportunity to study Russian conditions as head of the American Red Cross\nMission, expenses of which also were largely defrayed by his personal\ncontributions. He believes that the Bolsheviki constitute the greatest power\nagainst Pro-Germanism in Russia and that their propaganda has been undermining\nthe militarist regimes of the General Empires. Mr. Thompson deprecates\nAmerican criticism of the Bolsheviki. He believes they have been\nmisrepresented and has made the financial contribution to the cause in the\nbelief that it will be money well spent for the future of Russia as well as\nfor the Allied cause.\" [Kindle location 1412.] Note that Thompson was in\nPetrograd before, during and after the Bolshevik October Revolution. Sutton\ndocuments that Thompson's support for the Bolsheviks was far from exceptional\namong his class of top level capitalists, and that these capitalists had\nbacking from the Executive branch of the Federal government. [Read the book\nfor all the gory details!] One explanation for this apparently paradoxical\nalliance of capitalists and Lenin's Bolsheviks is given by Sutton. He argues\nthat these capitalists were monopolists who made their fortunes by using the\nU.S. government--the biggest monopoly of all, in their eyes--as an instrument\nfor personal enrichment, and that they saw that the highly centralized\ngovernment that the Bolsheviks were creating could be equally useful to them\nas a government that would force the people of Russia to pay very high prices\nfor American products. ---------------------- * I confirmed that this article\ntruly does exist by asking the reference person at Harvard University's\nWidener Library to check it; she found the article, but it was in the January\n31, 1918 edition, not the February 2, 1918 edition. I'm not sure why Sutton\ngives the latter date; maybe there were more than one edition with the article\nin it. If you doubt the veracity of this article, please call the library and\nfind out for yourself what they tell you. (Article changed on October 10, 2017\nat 20:53) The Mysterious \"Secret Stock\" - It Could Fund Your Retirement I am\nwriting this article for an audience consisting of all the good people who,\nlike myself, sincerely want a more equal and democratic society and who\n(unlike myself), to achieve this goal, look for leadership from the prominent\nindividuals and organizations that seem to share this goal. Most of these\nleaders are commonly identified either as \"of the Left\" or \"progressive\" or\n\"liberal\" or \"Marxist.\" In this article I will refer to all of these prominent\nleaders as \"the Left.\" According to the standard wisdom, the Left is providing\ngood leadership to achieve a more equal and democratic society and the problem\nis that not enough people follow this leadership, and so the enemies of the\nLeft (led by what I call the ruling class) remain in power. The problem, in\nthis mistaken view, is that the Left is weak. What I will show is that, on the\ncontrary, the problem (for those who want a more equal and democratic society,\nthat is) is that the Left is wrong. What do I mean? The Left is wrong in its\nfundamental view of ordinary people, and because of this wrong view the ruling\nclass is able to use the Left to divide and rule good people. So let's start\nby seeing what's wrong with the Left's view of ordinary people. The Left's\nWrong View of Ordinary People Before discussing the Left's wrong view it helps\nto say what the truth is about ordinary people. The truth is that the vast\nmajority of ordinary people (in the world, and in the United States as well)\nwant society to be based on the positive values of concern for one another (as\nopposed to dog-eat-dog competition), mutual aid (as opposed to some people\ntaking unfair advantage of others) and equality (in the sense of having no\nrich and no poor and in the sense of ordinary people rather than a privileged\nand self-serving elite having the real say in social decisions.) This is why\nordinary people are the solution, not the problem, today. The Left disagrees.\nThe Left views the majority of ordinary people as the problem, not the\nsolution, because their supposed values are the problem: selfishness and\ngreed, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and the list grows all the\ntime. The Left believes that certain subsets of ordinary people (people of\ncolor, non-heterosexuals, transgender people, etc.) are oppressed by the\nordinary people who are different. The solution, in this Leftist view, is to\npersuade the oppressive ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values.\nThe Marxist Left (which I have written about\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/revolution/socialism.html)) sometimes adds\nto the above an emphasis, more than the liberal/progressive leftists, on the\nissue of class: the material oppression of the working class by the capitalist\nclass. The Marxist Left thus, sharing the liberal/progressive left's negative\nview of the deplorable values of ordinary people, points out that despite\ntheir terrible values working class people nonetheless have a class interest\nin opposing the ruling class. The solution according to the Marxist Left is,\nagain, to persuade ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values (or,\nas the Marxists would say, to \"become class conscious.\") The idea that the\nvalues of the vast majority of ordinary people are the solution, not the\nproblem--that they are the values that ought to shape society and are the\nopposite of the terrible values of the ruling class--is the truthful idea that\nwill enable good people to succeed in building a huge popular movement to make\nsociety genuinely equal and democratic. (A wonderful entire book about this is\nonline\n[here](http://www.newdemocracyworld.org/old/Revolution/We%20Can%20Change%20the%20World%20book.pdf).)\nBut hardly anybody knows how true this idea is, thanks to the ruling class\npropaganda against it and also thanks to the Left's rejection of it. Perhaps\nyou, dear reader, think this idea is false. If so, please read (\n[here](http://newdemocracyworld.org/culture/right.html)) about my experience\nat a pro-Trump rally asking random people there if they thought it was a good\nidea or a bad idea to \"remove the rich from power to have real, not fake,\ndemocracy with no rich and no poor.\" 86% of them (43 out of the 50 I asked)\nthought it was a good (or great!) idea and those 43 people all gladly took my\nbutton with that message and many pinned it onto themselves right on the spot.\nConsider this please. If ordinary people were as selfish and vile as the Left\nclaims, then our world would be infinitely more horrible than it actually is,\nwith everybody stabbing each other in the back and nobody giving a damn about\nanybody else. This is the kind of world that it would be--a veritable hellish\nnightmare of a world--if the disgusting selfish competitive values of the\nruling class were also those of everybody else. The fact that our world is not\nthis hellish nightmare, but one in which most people cooperate and help each\nother and respect one another as equals in countless ways that we take so much\nfor granted that we don't think about them or even notice them, this fact has\nhuge significance: it shows that most ordinary people are the positive force\nin the world, a force that challenges capitalist values and that ought to\nshape all of society. How the Ruling Class USES the Left to Divide and Rule Us\nI have written a whole [book](https://www.amazon.com/NO-RICH-POOR-\nBook/dp/B073D876VD/ref%3Dsr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507566486&sr=1-5&keywords=spritzler)(Divide\nand Rule) about how the ruling class uses the Left to divide and rule us. What\nfollows is a brief summary with some links to some of my online articles\ntreating particular issues in more detail. Here's how the ruling class uses\nthe Left for divide-and-rule. The ruling class takes (or invents) a \"hot\nbutton\" (i.e., potentially very divisive social issue) and, with its control\nof the mainstream (and alternative!) media, it imposes a very particular\nframework on the public debate about the issue. The framework is designed to\nbe maximally divisive. The framework is made maximally divisive by defining\ntwo opposing views (I call them \"camps\") in a way that ensures that the people\nin each camp--when they hear about the opposing camp--will view the members of\nthe opposing camp with utter contempt and possibly fear. The ruling class does\nthis by a) providing each camp's position with arguments designed to be\nmaximally offensive to the other camp, and b) censoring facts that, if known,\nwould cause people in the opposing camps to see that they had far more\nagreement with each other than they otherwise would realize, and that the\nconcerns of the opposing camp were quite reasonable (instead of deplorable)\neven if they still disagreed. Here are some examples of how the ruling class\nuses the Left to make this work. How To Easily Kill All Indoor Odor, Mold, And\nBacteria -- Without Lifting A Finger\n\n",

            "input": "Disney's Hollywood Studios is quite often looked at as a 'half-day park.'\nPeople believe that it doesn't have much to offer in the form of attractions\nand entertainment, and so they only spend a few hours in the park dedicated to\ncelebrating film and stage classics. While Hollywood Studios is undergoing a\nsignificant amount of changes as they begin to construct both Star Wars Land\nand Toy Story Land, this doesn't mean that the park doesn't have much to\noffer. Here are four reasons why we keep going back to Disney's Hollywood\nStudios: 4. Excellent restaurants One of the things I love most about Disney's\nHollywood Studios is the table service restaurants because they are so\nwonderfully themed. From elegant and classy to old-fashioned and heart-\nwarming, these restaurants do a great job of serving you high quality food\nwith high quality service. I love the old Hollywood vibe and decadent menu at\nthe Hollywood Brown Derby, especially for a special night out. I also love the\nSci-Fi Dine In Theater, with its unique theming and restaurant setup and\nclassic American menu. The 50's Prime Time Cafe is another great option if you\nwant a fun dining experience, and you're even allowed to watch TV during\ndinner. 3. Star Wars If you're a fan of the classic franchise, then you are\ndefinitely going to keep going to Hollywood Studios. Though Star Wars Land\nisn't set to open for another few years, there is still an abundance of Star\nWars to go around in the meantime. Guests can ride Star Tours: The Adventure\nContinues and come face to face with some of the most beloved, and feared,\ncharacters of the franchise. They have even updated the ride to include\ncharacters from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Fans of Star Wars can also head\nto the Star Wars Launch Bay located in the animation courtyard. Inside, they\nwill have the chance to browse through Star Wars merchandise and meet\nChewbacca and Kylo Ren. 2. Entertainment Disney's Hollywood Studios does have\nquite a fun mix of entertainment, though many people choose to skip right over\nmost of it. One of the park's most spectacular forms of entertainment is\nBeauty and the Beast--Live On Stage. If you are a fan of the movie and a fan\nof musicals, this Broadway style show will have you singing and bopping along\nto the movie's most inspiring songs. Another big attraction in the park that\nI, personally, would consider a form of entertainment is the Frozen sing-a-\nlong in the theatre that once housed the American Idol Experience. Two\nArendelle historians, who bring the house down every time I see it, bring this\nfun and enchanting retelling of the story to life. Plus, who doesn't love to\nbelt out 'Let It Go'? And we can't forget about the nighttime show, Fantasmic!\nStep inside Mickey Mouse's imagination and see just how powerful your dreams\ncan be, complete with plenty of appearances from your favorite Disney\ncharacters. The park has also recently introduced a new holiday nighttime\nspectacular titled Jingle Bell, Jingle BAM! With plenty of special effects,\nprojections and fireworks, it's sure to become a family favorite. 1. Rides For\na park so small, Hollywood Studios has a killer lineup of attractions that is\nonly going to get better as it continues to get expanded. People come from all\nover the world just to experience the Tower of Terror, which is a classic ride\nthat has been helping guests 'drop in' since 1994. Hollywood Studios is also\nhome to one of the few classic roller coasters Disney has--Rock 'N' Roller\nCoaster. With high speeds, twists, turns and funky music, this attraction is a\nmust-do during your time in the park. One of the more recent additions to the\npark, and my personal favorite, is Toy Story Midway Mania, which lets you\nbattle your friends and family in five carnival-inspired games inspired by\ndifferent Toy Story characters. And, of course, we can't forget about The\nGreat Movie Ride, which is a must-do for any film fans visiting the park. You\nget to step inside some of the most iconic movie scenes in film history, and\nyou even get to be part of the show as well. These are only a few of the\nattractions available to you, but it proves that there are many things that\nwill keep you coming back. Though many people will try to argue that Disney's\nHollywood Studios isn't a park worth spending an entire day at, there are many\nreasons why they're wrong. With a variety of restaurants, entertainment and\nattractions, there are plenty of things to do that will keep you and your\nfamily entertained all day long. Be sure to check out all that Hollywood\nStudios has to offer during your next trip.

            "input": "RUSH: I used to read The Economist. It's a British magazine that focuses on\neconomic matters. It's also a journal of opinion disguised, and my memory is\nthat The Economist -- and I'm talking 20 years ago, now, 25 years. I haven't\nread it in a long, long time. It used to be approved reading by the\nintellectual right. My memory was that it was valuable here and there. It had\nsome decent insight. But they're gone. Look at this: [The Economist explains\nhow Donald Trump may be making life easier for\nMS-13](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21725814-gang-members-\noften-want-join-one-most-fearsome-reputation-federal), the street gang. This\nis very long, typically long. The Economist's argument, the point is Trump's\ntough talk is encouraging and emboldening the street gang MS-13. That's right!\nTough talk at the North Korean lunatic dictator? That's just making him\nbigger! That's just making him tougher. That's just steeling his resolve. Now\nTrump is doing the same thing -- he's talking tough on MS-13 -- and what's\nhappening? He's making them bigger! Let me ask you a question: What is the\nstatus of illegal immigration in the country today versus when Trump was\ninaugurated? In fact, let's just measure it year over year. Illegal\nimmigration is way down, is it not? I mean, it's down by a factor of millions,\nis it not? It is, folks. Don't doubt me. Have we had any significant changes\nin the law? Has there been any comprehensive or otherwise immigration reform\nor new legislation? The answer is, no. There hasn't been any substantive\nchange whatsoever. How has Donald Trump been approaching the issue? Well,\nsince the middle of 2015, he's been talkin' tough on it, and he's been tellin'\npeople we're going to build a wall -- and he's been telling people that if\nthey come in illegally, we're going to track them down and we're going to\ndeport them. He's been telling people if they're here illegally and we find\nthem we're going to deport them. The point is Donald Trump has been talking\ntough on illegal immigration, and what has happened? It's way down. The number\nof people trying to get into the country illegally is way, way down. Now if\nyou listen to the left, Donald Trump's tough talk on illegal immigration\nshould have them pouring over the border. Donald Trump's tough talk on illegal\nimmigration should be making these illegal immigrants and their coyotes and\ntheir supporters twice or three times as committed to get in here. But it's\nnot working out that way. Just the enforcement of existing law -- the promise\nto enforce existing law, the threat to enforce existing law, the commitment to\nbuild the wall, the tough talk, the committed talk on the policy -- is\nactually working. It is causing there to be a massive, major reduction in the\nnumbers of people attempting to get into the country illegally. There's\ndocumented evidence that tough talk is working. Honest, tough talk is working.\nYet, tough talk with Kim Jong-un? \"Oh, no! It's going to lead to nuclear war!\nOh my God, we're going to die!\" Same thing with MS-13, according to The\nEconomist. Donald Trump is making life for these gang members easier and\neasier. He's talking tough and he's just helping them recruit more members.\nNow you can't have it both ways.\n\n",

Former Presidential candidate and current Donald Trump sycophant\nMike Huckabee can barely even remember basic facts, like whether or not Trump\nhas ever [admitted](http://www.liberalamerica.life/2016/07/22/10-must-know-\nfacts-sexual-assault-accusations-donald-trump-video/) to committing sexual\nassault. The things Republicans have to tell themselves and the public in\norder to continue pushing their agenda take some serious mental gymnastics. We\nhave Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway\n[coining](http://www.liberalamerica.life/2017/05/10/alternative-facts-conway-\ncrashes-and-burns-during-cnn-interview-video/) the term \"alternative facts.\"\nFormer Press Secretary Sean Spicer became a laughing stock for his\n[outrageous](http://www.liberalamerica.life/2017/01/22/sean-big-baby-spicer-\nwhines-unfair-coverage-first-press-conference-video/) defenses of President\nDonald Trump's statements and behavior. And the person who took Spicer's Job,\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, has continued that trend. For example, she\n[suggested](http://www.liberalamerica.life/2017/09/15/jemele-hill-uses-her-\nstrong-black-womanhood-to-destroy-white-house-bullies/) that ESPN analyst\nJemele Hill be fired for bullying President Trump on Twitter, despite the fact\nthat the President regularly uses his own Twitter account to shout down\nopponents and turn his followers against others. However, Sarah's father Mike\nHuckabee may take the cake with his comments on Fox &amp; Friends this\nmorning. Conservatives have loved speaking about disgraced Hollywood mogul\nHarvey Weinstein and his donations to Democratic causes and candidates, and\nTrump's favorite morning team and Huckabee decided to tie it back to Hillary\nClinton yet again. Host Abby Huntsman started things off by\n[addressing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlNohP7u0IM) Huckabee: \"There was\nalso an uncomfortable moment when she talked about President Trump, how he\nadmitted to being sexual assaulter. She was asked about the Weinstein\nsituation and she mentioned how her husband - Bill Clinton - what he did was\nin the past. Anyone watching that, I think, was a little squirmy in their\nseat. She even looks squirmy, talking about it. Has President Trump ever\nadmitted to being a sexual assaulter?\" Anyone with a halfway functioning brain\nwould of course recall the infamous Access Hollywood tape where Trump\n[bragged](http://www.liberalamerica.life/2016/10/07/you-can-grab-them-by-the-\npy-wapo-unearths-most-horrific-trump-recording-yet-video/) about grabbing\nwomen \"by the pussy\" because he was famous. Huckabee, apparently, lacks that\nhalfway functioning brain,\n[responding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlNohP7u0IM): \"I don't recall\nthat that has ever happened.\" He then proceeds to turn the discussion back to\nBill Clinton, who, if you recall, was President twenty years ago.

He was trying to stay out of the police logs, and gave\nhimself one Internet cookie for going a full month without stabbing, shooting,\nor running over someone with a car: He gets another Internet cookie for going\nfour days sober: And he's going legit because the \"feds out here snatching\neverybody\": Also this: I have no idea what that means, but it sounds\nimportant. VERY important. Anyway, it is gonna be interesting to see what the\nkiller's motivation was in Las Vegas. He shot at a country music festival. A\nplace that more than likely was filled with people who voted for Donald Trump.\nNot saying that's his motive, but he could've shot up any large group of\npeople and he chose this one. Just sayin.

Reno police officer Tim Broadway told [The Associated\nPress](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/oct/10/break-in-reported-at-las-\nvegas-shooters-home-in-re/), \"Nobody really saw anything, just a light was on\nwith nobody in the residence.\" Broadway said officers discovered that \"someone\nhad broken into the house\" and he immediately contacted the FBI. He added that\nthe suspects broke into the home through the front door over the weekend, but\nsaid he was not sure exactly how they gained entry. Police are not aware of\nany damages or anything that was stolen. There are no suspects at this time or\nany descriptions of a suspect. According to\n[KOLOtv](http://www.kolotv.com/content/news/RPD-not-involved-in-investigation-\ninto-Vegas-shooting-suspect-449079193.html) investigators searched Paddock's\nReno home on October 3rd and found firearms. At a news conference Tuesday\nafternoon, Investigators said they found five handguns, two shotguns and a\n\"plethora of ammunition\" and electronics. The house is being treated as a\npotential crime scene. At least some of the guns found on Paddock's properties\nhad been bought at the Cabela's store in Verdi. We can't even trust the FBI at\nthis point so who knows what really happened with this 'break-in'. The current\nHead of the FBI in Las Vegas was appointed by former FBI Head and now admitted\nleaker James Comey. Is this why the investigation is such a mess? The\ninvestigation into the events and the motive behind the Las Vegas shooting\nlast Sunday night is in flux. To date no motive is provided by the FBI and\nlocal police. Last week a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the\nlocal Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent murder of at least 59 people\nin that city. The Sheriff appeared transparent in the information he supplied.\nBut the major question that everyone wanted to know was - why did the killer\ndo it? What was his motive? Monday we found out that the killer shot the\nsecurity guardbefore he fired on the crowd of people. This directly\ncontradicts with the earlier report that the security guard found the room of\nthe killer and stopped him from shooting on the crowd. As a result many more\nquestions are raised like - Why the change in story? Why did the killer ever\nstop shooting on the crowd if the security guard did not stop him? The FBI's\nlack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI\nDirectors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to\nfurther lose trust in the FBI.

He appears to be in critical but stable condition. Several other\nRepublican lawmakers witnessed the carnage. The shooter, \"socialist democrat\"\nJames Hodgkinson, wasn't so lucky, succumbing to wounds received in a shootout\nwith police officers. This shooting is a harsh reminder of the growing vitriol\nin American politics where violence between liberal and conservative hard-\nliners is only becoming more common, with both sides committing inexcusable\nviolence. The shooting occurred during an early morning baseball practice. The\nshooter, Hodgkinson, appears to have been an ardent Bernie Sanders supporter\nand opposed President Trump. His choice of targets was almost certainly not\nrandom and was likely premeditated. Hodgkinson is from Illinois but has been\nstaying in the DC area for at least six weeks. Besides Scalise, two police\nofficers were wounded during the shooting. Senator Paul Rand, who witness the\nevent, has hailed the police officers and credited them for preventing a far\nworse tragedy. The police officers present were there to guard Scalise.\nHodgkinson already had a track record with the police before the shooting. He\nhad previously been charged with assault and battery for punching a woman in\nthe face with a closed fist. He also confronted that woman's boyfriend with a\nshotgun, reportedly firing one shot in the air. Apparently, he also physically\nabused his daughter, and police were called when he started shooting several\npine trees on his property. Neighbors were worried that bullets would strike\nnearby homes. Hodgkinson also claimed to be a \"democratic socialist\" on his\nsocial media profiles. Writing to the Belleville News-Democrat, he stated, \"I\ndon't ever again want to hear how great a president [Ronald Reagan] was. All\nhe did was give tax breaks to the rich and put the rest of the country (or at\nleast 13.1 percent) out of work.\" He added, \"To think the Republican Party can\ncall this man their idol is un-American.

He upbraided Iran as a corrupt and malignant regime that had\ntaken America and its allies to the cleaners with the nuclear deal--'One of\nthe worst and most one-sided transactions.' And for good measure, he scoffed\nat various socialist regimes around the globe. The only term missing in his\ndyspeptic assessment of the carnage around the world was 'axis of evil,' the\nphrase that George W. Bush made famous when he decried Iran, North Korea and\nIraq after the 9/11 attacks. The language he deployed was seldom less than\napocalyptic.

One problem is that the avenue isn't actually strong enough\nto withstand the weight of tanks rolling over it. Never mind. For Trump, these\nare mere details. He has apparently become enamoured by a vision of a\nmilitarised America that can set wrong aright abroad, whenever and wherever it\npleases. His bellicosity is discordant, however, with the more isolationist\nAmerica First doctrines that he brayed about during the presidential campaign.\nAmerica First has been converted into a bellicose unilateralism.

What about the country that\nmeddled with the 2016 American elections, thereby violating the precious\nsovereignty Trump dwelled upon? There was nary a word about Russia.

            "input": "Donald Trump has been hiding in plain sight. Or not hiding. Seldom, if ever,\nhas an American politician so aggressively acted out and imposed his\nunfiltered personality on the public, consequences be damned. And yet, the\nfinal weeks of the presidential campaign now are wholly centered on the\nmedia's shocking revelations about who he really is. \"Well, where have you\nbeen?\" is one glaring question for the media. The other is about how complicit\nthe media has been in covering for him until now. Trump is a thrice-married\nbeauty pageant owner, a compulsive attention seeker and a sexual braggart. The\npossibility of him not engaging in lewd, loutish, outre and, for a\npresidential candidate, scandalous behavior is nil. Was no one in the media\nlooking? Did nobody care about the details? Or was it just not possible to\nbelieve what was as clear as the noses on our faces? A journalist's job can't\nbe so easy as that. Or, perhaps, it was just a case of not wanting to belabor\nthe obvious: It would hardly seem to advance the discussion to insist that\nTrump is an oaf, brute, philistine and cad, which is, of course, exactly the\nshocked -- shocked! -- point that now repeatedly is being made in the\ncampaign's final days. Or, as the candidate uniquely created and promoted by\nthe media, has he been gamely protected and tolerated through stages of\namusement, gratefulness (\"It may not be good for America, but it's damn good\nfor CBS,\" said CBS Corp. chief Leslie Moonves earlier in the cycle, no doubt\nnow regretfully), incredulity and alarm, until we reached the horror stage in\nSeptember with a sudden leveling of the polls, prompting the media to act in\nrighteous concert? The unavoidable awkwardness, of course, is that so many of\nthe details about Trump's particular sort of sleaziness, so many smoking guns,\nactually have been in the hands of the media all along. The more or less fatal\nbullet came from the NBC-owned infotainment show Access Hollywood. Billy Bush,\nwho would become a Today show regular this summer -- that is, an employee of\nthe NBC News division of NBCUniversal -- was the other party to the tape. He\nknew! Reports indicate that inside NBC he was talking openly about what he\nknew since this past August. Still, perhaps this wasn't seen so much as news\nbut as Trump being Trump, as hilarity. Really, does the video reveal anything\nabout Trump that was not previously known? Bush, now losing his Today role,\nbecomes something of a tragic figure in this. In the business of stroking\ncelebrities, he now is reviled for stroking one. Likewise, NBC, ever on the\njob of the care and maintenance of NBC stars, was no doubt instinctively\nreluctant to shoot one -- one, as it happens, running for president. Billy\nBush Part of the rationale about the video's news value, and for why the media\nshould be so righteous about stomping on Trump now, is the seeming singularity\nof the vulgarity in Trump's own voice. (For those without television or\ninternet, he told Bush, among other things, he \"moved\" on Bush's Access\nHollywood co-anchor Nancy O'Dell \"like a bitch\" and noted \"when you're a star,\nthey let you do it. You can do anything. … Grab them by the pussy. You can do\nanything.\") To have imagined it, to have intellectually appreciated what it\nmust be, is nothing like actually hearing it. And yet, it turns out his real\nvoice, offering a detailed and nuanced account of his sexual views and habits,\nwas not at all unique. What he said theoretically in private to Bush he has\nsaid publicly over and over again with many variations -- including agreeing\nwith the description of himself as a sexual predator -- to Howard Stern, for\n30 years a leading champion of sexual harassment practices. Trump himself --\nrecalling Gary Hart's fatal invitation to reporters to follow him if they\ndidn't believe his claims of virtue -- assured Anderson Cooper during the\nsecond debate that, in fact, he really didn't do the things he said he did.\nVoila! Among the accounts to swiftly contradict him was one from a former\nPeople reporter, Natasha Stoynoff, assigned to cover Trump and Melania at Mar-\na-Lago in 2005 on the occasion of their first wedding anniversary. During the\ninterview, in Stoynoff's telling, Trump sexually assaults her with a sudden\nkiss and grope. It is pretty much only Trump himself who now points out that\nthe article she wrote based on this interview is a celebratory one. Nobody\nelse, least of all anyone in the media, is saying People published a\nfraudulent story. It lied: People had firsthand proof the marriage was\nsomething other than what it said it was but drooled sycophantically over the\ncouple anyway. The influence of People contributed to creating the celebrity\nstature of Trump. Now, with no more information than it had then, it wants to\ntake that stature back. Who's responsible for what? Who's less trustworthy\nhere? From left: Trump with actress Arianne Zucker and Bush, who was fired\nOct. 17 by NBC. Another aspect of the media rationale for why now and not\nbefore involves the recently enshrined journalistic principle that the\ntestimony of one victim brings out supporting testimony of others -- and now\nthere's a growing list of Trump grope victims -- quite putting aside the fact\nthat when witnesses have the opportunity to compare accounts, that necessarily\nlessens reliability. While it is wholly believable that Trump systematically\nmashed a lot of women, it also is as reasonable that the rudeness and\ngrossness he has made no secret of, only now, in the tailoring of a chorus of\naccounts (lawyers shaping the language of decade-old memories) inflates to a\nmedia consensus of sociopathic if not criminal behavior. Indeed, The New York\nTimes, when it previously pursued the issue of Trump's behavior toward women\nfor an article in May, relying on independent accounts, came up with an\nentirely different tenor of story -- \"a complex, at times contradictory\nportrait of a wealthy, well-known and provocative man and the women around\nhim, one that defies simple categorization.\" Trump, not surprisingly, now that\nhe has been simply categorized as a sex abuser, makes matters worse for\nhimself. By attacking the media -- with toothless threats of lawsuits -- he\nfortifies its unity and its certainty. But you can see why he's hurt and\nconfused. For so long the media encouraged him to be Donald Trump. Thirty\nyears of enabling him and encouraging him. And through more than 18 months of\ncampaigning for president, it really seemed like he was going to get away with\nbeing who he was. But let no one forget: The media, if it makes you -- in this\ninstance with great civic resolve -- can break you, too.

Watch the\nvideo below, and scroll through this gallery of Melania Pics to see if you can\nspot the difference! To the casual viewer half-paying attention to another\nPOTUS and FLOTUS appearance, there's really nothing amiss about Melania. It's\nwhen you look closer that you see some subtle differences. \"Melania\" -- if\nthat's her real name -- is wearing massive sunglasses that cover half her\nface. Chic, or suspicious? Her lips appear to be much bigger and differently\nshaped. As some have pointed out, her hair is a little frizzy and dry, far\nfrom the pristine condition she usually keeps it in. Could it be a wig? Pay\nattention to the president, too. He says, \"My wife, Melania, who happens to be\nright here…\" Why would he need to point that out? Is he letting the world know\nthat this isn't Melania, and the real one's chilling in Air Force One?\nThinking about it, this isn't the first time that he's seemingly been confused\nabout Melania's whereabouts while they happen to be in the same room. During\ntheir trip to Texas to visit the victims of Hurricane Harvey, he said,\n\"Melania wanted to be here today\" during a press conference. Melania was\nstanding directly beside him in her FLOTUS hat. Did Melania stay home and send\nout a decoy in her disaster heels? Of course, the most logical answer here is\nthat Melania was simply having a bad hair day, wore a little too much\nlipliner, and on impulse bought a pair of sunglasses that her friends haven't\ntold her don't work yet. Or…the conspiracy theorists have a valid point.\nPolitical decoys have been used throughout modern history to protect high-\npowered individuals from harm, or to attend to duties they cannot fulfill\nthemselves. However, the technique's been used very sparingly, and most likely\nwouldn't work for someone like Melania. Let these voters tell you why they're\nabsolutely convinced we've got a bodysnatcher in the White House:\nHollywoodLifers, do you think the White House is using a Melania Trump stunt\ndouble? Let us know!\n\n",

It's not something Comey sought or welcomed. A law enforcement official\nwho prizes his reputation, he didn't relish becoming a hate figure for half\nthe country or more. No, the only reason that Comey figures in the election at\nall is that Democrats knowingly nominated someone under FBI investigation.\nOnce upon a time -- namely any presidential election prior to this one -- this\nenormous political and legal vulnerability would have disqualified a\ncandidate. Not this year, and not in the case of Hillary Clinton. The country\nhas clearly lowered its standards in this election, and Donald Trump's madcap\ncandidacy provides evidence of that almost every day. But Hillary's nomination\nwas itself an offense against American political norms and an incredibly\nreckless act. And the Democrats were supposed to be the party acting\nrationally. Clinton effectively locked up the nomination in June and wasn't\ncleared of criminal wrongdoing by the FBI until July. What if she had been\nindicted? Would Democrats have run her anyway? Would they have substituted in\na 74-year-old socialist who had lost the nomination battle, or someone else\nwho hadn't even run? Any of these circumstances would have been unprecedented,\nbut Democrats risked it. They did it, in part, because they could never bring\nthemselves to fully acknowledge the seriousness of the email scandal and,\nrelatedly, the ethical miasma around the Clinton Foundation. They considered\nit all another desperate trick of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy. Clinton\nhenchman David Brock demanded that the New York Times retract its initial\nreport of Clinton's exclusive use of a private email account in March 2015. A\nparade of Democratic operatives pooh-poohed the whole thing, from Clinton\nspokesman Karen Finney (\"a politically motivated series of attacks\") to James\nCarville (\"not going to amount to a hill of beans\") to Howard Dean (\"hooey\").\nWhen they first got on a debate stage together last October, Bernie Sanders,\nthe only man who had a chance to stop Clinton, pleased the crowd with a\nringing denunciation of interest in her emails. Democrats bought the just-so\nstories offered up by the Clinton campaign. The FBI investigation was just a\n\"security review.\" The FBI wasn't investigating Hillary, but only her server.\nAnything to deflect from the seriousness of the matter. While Democrats\nwillfully looked the other way, they put Comey in an impossible position. An\nindictment would change the course of American history. That was all on him.\nHe ultimately blinked. But he also put on the record the recklessness of\nClinton's practices as secretary of state in an attempt to create public\naccountability. Comey's conduct is open to criticism, but there's no way to\nplease everyone when handling a case with such high political stakes. His\nnotification to Congress last weekend is another case in point. All that can\nbe said is that if Democrats didn't want the FBI to have any part in the\nelection, they could've considered that before nominating Clinton. Trump may\nbe a deeply flawed candidate, but he caught a wave of popular fervor; Hillary,\nwith her astonishing vulnerabilities, is a production of the Democratic elites\nwho did everything to get her over the finish line. Just how vulnerable is\nshe? If it weren't for the new trove of Huma Abedin emails, the blockbuster\nnews this week would come via a Wall Street Journal report that the FBI is\ninvestigating the Clinton Foundation -- although Fox News reported the same\nthing at the beginning of the year, and Hillary, of course, dismissed it as an\n\"unsourced and irresponsible claim that has no basis.\" The email scandal and\nClinton Foundation will dog Hillary until Election Day and, should she win,\ninto her presidency. For this, she has no one to blame but herself -- and her\nirresponsible enablers.\n\n",

            "input": "By Joe Boatwright: I'm amazed that there is still an argument surrounding\nglobal warming. Most of the literature is full of articles from organizations\nthat deal with planetary weather issues or other political organizations that\nhave joined the climate change movement. Conclusively, none of any of their\nglobal warming predictions have come to fruition. Almost every assertion has\nbeen debunked or proven false, sometimes by other parts of the same\norganization! Why should conservatives continue to debate liberals on this\ntopic? Firstly, conservatives should always try to stop any insanity from the\nleft, no matter what the subject. Secondly, the left continues to put forth\ntheir agenda on global warming, no matter how idiotic. So unfortunately, the\nright must respond against these arguments (again, no matter how absurd). Rush\nLimbaugh agreed by positing another reason: \"The only reason we're even\ntalking about global warming -- well, the real only reason -- is its part of\nthe left's agenda of expanding government worldwide, raising taxes worldwide,\nand a key ingredient of this is blaming average citizens for the problem.\" The\nconservative fight is to keep the left's 'one world order' and worldwide tax\nincreases from happening. We should not allow them to blame anyone for\nsomething that does not exist and can't be proven. Back in August 2014 Alex\nNewman wrote in The New American, [\"Embarrassing Predictions Haunt the Global-\nWarming\nIndustry.\"](https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/18888-embarrassing-\npredictions-haunt-the-global-warming-industry) This excellent article details\nin length the litany of failed global warming predictions. It also criticizes\norganizations like the UN that recanted some of their farcical claims,\nsometimes even before they could be proven wrong. In one instance, the UN\ndiscovered their 'scientific' evidence came from the World Wildlife Fund\npropaganda literature. The claims from the liberal agenda of these\norganizations are so outlandish that it wouldn't be surprising for them to\nthrow in some type of zombie apocalypse. Global Warming is not scientific; it\nhas become a political issue with many commenters who act as experts. In\naddition, articles that have been debunked continue to be echoed in other\ncommentaries. These commentaries continue to make further inane assertions\nbased on information already proven wrong. Global warming theorists who act as\nthough this information is the word of God have taken the definition of non-\nsequitur to another level. Neuman points this out: \"the UN Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) has acted as the main scaremonger for the\nglobal warming lobby that led to the Kyoto Protocol.\" However, \"the IPCC is a\npolitical, not scientific, body.\" Only liberal extremists still beat the\nglobal warming drum -- you shouldn't be listening. No compatible source was\nfound for this video. However, global warming myths continue to circulate\nperiodically, despite being dispelled at length. For instance, there is the\nworry of our ecosystems being disrupted by rising temperatures or increasing\nCO2. Numerous studies show that there is no proof of rising temperatures\ndistinct from natural system variations, and atmospheric CO2 is a beneficial\nfertilizer for plants! Regardless of the causes of these variations, the\nplanet's ecosystems have been adapting since the beginning of time. Almost as\nan urban legend, abnormal ice melting claims about both the north and south\npole regions continue. But the only thing that is abnormal is that anyone\nbelieves them. I had two liberal colleagues at the CIA who believed in global\nwarming and neither had any proof to justify their opinions. One had just\nexperienced a hurricane and said that he would crush anyone's head who was a\nnon-believer in global warming. He was later fired, not because of his global\nwarming beliefs, but because of his poor analytical skills. Our very liberal\noffice allowed the other colleague to show slides from a vacation trip to the\nArctic Circle. In addition, an alleged diminishing local animal population was\npresented as further proof. Of course, no real proof was presented. As one of\nthe senior analysts of the office, I took no real part in the discussions.\nOffice politics aside, I took to heart Mark Twain's saying, \"never argue with\na fool; onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.\" However, in their\ndefense, they never professed to be experts -- they were just more misguided\nliberals (is that redundant?) who are plentiful everywhere including the\nintelligence agencies. How can you argue with the so-called global warming\nexperts that use the inanest 'evidence' and arguments to support their claims?\nFor instance, it is amazing how many 'experts' use fictional movies about\nglobal warming to support their claims! If Al Gore gives up on Global Warming,\nhe should move on to vampires, werewolves, and zombies. There are plenty of\nmovies with that type of scientific evidence! I'm surprised that people aren't\ncurious why there are no other climate claims other than global warming. For\nexample, what happened to concerns about oceans. Seriously, decades ago severe\npollution and rising sea levels was as big of a concern as global warming. I\nread that there was a swordfish in the Smithsonian that was over 150 years\nold, and that a group of global warming advocates would have conclusive proof\nof the effects of industrial man if the tissue in the swordfish was\nsignificantly different from fish of today. However, examination showed that\nit wasn't. Thus, they had to go back to their old theory of rising oceans,\nwhich of course, can't be proven either. When I was living in the D.C. area,\none of the stations was particularly proud of their new Doppler radar that\ncost hundreds of thousands of dollars. They touted that it could predict snow\narrival, as well as depth. As a former Army air defender with a knowledge of\nthis radar, I didn't think they fully understood its capabilities or value.\nThe other stations predicted the weather just as well without the radar, one\nstation even used an old wooden yardstick to show the depth of the snow. Their\ndepth measured the exact same as the station with the Doppler. Some cynics\nbelieve accuracy was never the goal in any global warming forecasts anyway;\nthe goal was always to gain more money, power, and influence. I agree with\nother rational, logical 'climate deniers' that \"the Earth's climate has always\nchanged, and very likely will continue to change, regardless of what humans\ndo. What is now clear, though, is that the establishment has no idea what\nthose changes will be -- much less what drives the changes or how to control\nthem.\" However, does it really matter to a liberal what the truth is? They\ncontrol almost all of the main stream media,which in turn presents their\npropaganda. It is shamefully evident why there are so few conservative\nmessages from the media. If the left are so correct, shouldn't they still\ncompare and contrast their opinion with others to prove their point?\n\n",

Not only do I think\nthat a Donald Trump presidency would be far less disastrous than a Hillary\nClinton one but I'd even suggest - albeit cautiously - that the world might\nbecome a better, safer, more prosperous place. The world could be safer if\nDonald Trump wins against Hillary Cliton Let me stress that Donald Trump is by\nno means my dream candidate for the post of the next leader of the free world.\nI perfectly well accept that he is a vulgar, rude, bullying, ignorant, sexist\nchancer who entered the presidential race on a whim and may end up getting the\njob only by default. But Donald Trump has at least two massive qualities in\nhis favour. The first is that he is not Hillary, a corrupt, ailing serial\nfibber with a dubious track record (from the Whitewater financial scandal to\nBenghazi, where her negligence may have resulted in the murder of the US\nambassador) and a snooty contempt for the law demonstrated most by the FBI\ninvestigation into her hidden emails. And the second is that he is not a paid\nup member of the Washington DC establishment. Trump, not unlike Nigel Farage,\nis the voice of the ordinary bloke or woman who has had just about enough of\nthe remote, spoilt, anti-democratic political elite. Yes, America is a very\ndifferent place from Britain but there are definitely echoes in the US\npresidential campaign of the tensions which led so many of us to vote for\nBrexit. While America's rich have got richer, living standards for its working\nfolk have remained stagnant for decades. This is at least in part because of a\ncosy stitch-up between the governing elite - lawyers, corporations,\npoliticians and the overmighty US central bank the Federal Reserve - which has\nentrenched its own power by making it almost impossible for those lower down\nto climb the ladder. Adding to these financial pressures are the frustrations\ncaused by mass illegal immigration and also by the liberal elite's obsession\nwith political correctness, which has led to a woefully bad state education\nsystem, an increase in Islamist terrorism and a burning sense of injustice,\nespecially among blue-collar Americans that they can't speak their minds and\nthat their country is no longer their own. Mrs Clinton is a corrupt, ailing\nserial fibber with a dubious track record Trump's proposed solutions - build a\nwall on the Mexican border to stop immigration, ban Muslims(!), protect\nAmerican jobs with tariff barriers on imports, hammer the Federal Reserve,\nstop wasting gazillions of dollars pretending to \"combat\" climate change - may\nbe impetuous and in some cases extreme. But the point is here at last is a\npolitician bold enough to address the real and pressing problems that most of\nhis contemporaries have preferred to brush under the carpet. While Obama has\nfiddled during his eight years as president the world has burned: the Middle\nEast crisis has worsened; terrorism has proliferated; Russia and China have\nflexed their muscles; the eurozone has stagnated; the refugee problem has got\nout of control; and almost nothing has been done to address the underlying\neconomic problems that led to the 2008 crash. If Hillary gets in, it will be\nmore of the same. Trump on the other hand is a radical who might actually\npress the reset button. Tue, November 8, 2016 The top photos following the\ncampaign journey of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the US Elections 2016\nUS Elections 2016 in pictures Take Russia: for the Washington establishment\nit's the world's biggest geopolitical threat with Putin being painted as the\nnew Stalin. But Trump just isn't interested in prolonging the Cold War, let\nalone provoking a Third World War. He sees Putin as a flawed man with whom he\ncan nonetheless do business. This will appal those who just want to focus on\nPutin's human rights record but may come as a relief to those who would prefer\nto have Russia as an awkward ally rather than as a belligerent, chippy basket\ncase on Europe's doorstep. Donald Trump giving the thumbs up Trump is the\nvoice of the everyday folk in America Let's hope this strategy works because\none of the bigger worries about Trump is his view on Nato: he has even\nsuggested - against Nato policy - that if one of its member states were\nattacked, America wouldn't necessarily go to its defence. This is one of those\nareas where you have to hope that the wiser counsels of his advisers will\nprevail. That said, it would be no bad thing if Trump's remarks about Nato\nmembers failing to pull their weight were to concentrate the minds of European\ngovernments, ours included, on the woeful neglect of our defence budgets. No\none is pretending that Trump is the dream presidential candidate but then\nwe've just had eight years of the \"dream\" one - or so the slavish liberal\nmedia kept telling us - and he was useless. Maybe the time has come for\nsomeone who really does want to make America great again. And if we're lucky\nperhaps a little bit of that optimism will rub off on the rest of us too.\n\n",

Hillary Clinton boasts\nthat her experience traveling to 112 countries as secretary of state qualifies\nher to be president. Don't believe it. Evidence shows she left the State\nDepartment in shambles and our nation weaker. Her record at Foggy Bottom\ndisqualifies her to be president. Her failures go beyond leaving four\nAmericans to die in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the ridiculous Russian \"reset\"\nand the carnage in Syria that she and President Obama idly watched unfold --\nand that gets more horrific daily. A string of investigative reports from the\nObama administration shows that she botched key management jobs as secretary\nof state, threatening American lives and our diplomatic secrets. Clinton's\nState Department repeatedly rebuffed requests for additional security for the\nvulnerable compound at Benghazi, Libya. The result? Heavily armed terrorists\nwere able to storm the compound and kill Ambassador Christopher Stevens and\nthree other Americans. But Benghazi wasn't an isolated case. Clinton failed to\nsecure diplomatic posts in Pakistan, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and other global\nhot spots. Internal State Department reports show the posts lacked emergency\nplans in case of attack. Guards assigned to them had no training in chemical\nor biological threats and, amazingly, some hadn't undergone background checks.\nClinton tried to weasel out of taking the blame for Benghazi, testifying to\nCongress that she wasn't personally involved in embassy security. But emails\nlater revealed that was false. Investigators also point to Clinton's total\nneglect of cybersecurity. The Bush administration -- reeling from the attack\non the World Trade Center -- had made it a top priority to protect information\nflow among embassies, the CIA and the FBI. But Clinton dropped the ball,\ncreating what the department's inspector general called \"undue risk in the\nmanagement of information.\" In November 2013, the IG issued an alert to the\nState Department's top executives about the urgent \"recurring weaknesses\" in\ncybersecurity that had been red-flagged in six previous reports between 2011\nand 2013, almost all on Clinton's watch. The \"recurring weaknesses\" had still\nnot been addressed, including vulnerabilities to hackers. One of those\nprevious reports -- from July 2013 (shortly after Clinton's departure) --\ndescribed how much of the cybersecurity work was actually being done by\ncontractors rather than department staff, contrary to government policy. John\nBentel, in charge of State's cybersecurity during Clinton's tenure, is one of\nthe five State Department staffers who demanded immunity before talking to FBI\ninvestigators about Clinton's private-server scheme. He apparently took his\nduties regarding Clinton's secret server more seriously than his duties to\nsafeguard national cybersecurity. According to an IG report, Bentel\n\"instructed his subordinates not to discuss the secretary's email.\" Rudy\nGiuliani said on Saturday Clinton's use of a private email service for\nofficial business was like taking \"all our top-secret material and throwing it\nout on Fifth Avenue.\" Outrageous, but still a lesser offense than Clinton's\nneglect of the entire department's digital security -- exposing communications\nbetween thousands of agents and diplomats across the globe. Even after\nWikiLeaks released 250,000 confidential State Department documents in 2010,\nClinton didn't plug the obvious holes in State's cyber setup. Yet during\nMonday's debate, Clinton had the nerve to claim that she takes threats to the\nnation's cybersecurity very seriously. That's a laugh. Hillary's management of\nfinances at State was also slipshod, according to inspector general reports\nthat point to a whopping $6 billion unaccounted for during her tenure.\nClinton's chaotic mismanagement created \"conditions conducive to fraud,\" the\nIG warned, and made it harder \"to punish and deter criminal behavior.\" She\nmust have felt right at home. True to Clinton's instinct to cover up problems\nrather than fix them, she thwarted several investigations of sexual misconduct\nand prostitution at State. Investigators complained of \"an appearance of undue\ninfluence and favoritism.\" So what are the odds Hillary would run the federal\ngovernment with integrity, keep the nation safe and get taxpayers more for\ntheir money? Zero. Betsy McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for\nPolicy Research.\n\n",

You don't have to listen to what I say.\" A\ndefiant Kimmel added that he doesn't say \"I don't mind\" because he preferred\n\"everyone with a television to watch the show.\" \"But if they're so turned off\nby my opinion on healthcare and gun violence then, I don't know, I probably\nwouldn't want to have a conversation with them anyway,\" he continued. \"Not\ngood riddance, but riddance.\" The last place you want to be is on the\nreceiving end of Ben Shapiro's laser sharp tongue. The Daily Wire founder\nobliterated late night host Jimmy Kimmel's \"abhorrent,\" and \"nasty\" gun\ncontrol views. Almost two weeks after\n[demolishing](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-\nhouck/2017/09/21/ben-shapiro-eviscerates-jimmy-kimmels-health-care-tirades-\negregious) Jimmy Kimmel over his asinine health-care tirades, conservative\nstar and podcast host Ben Shapiro obliterating the ABC late-night host on\nTuesday for an \"abhorrent, \"gross,\" and \"nasty\" [gun control\nrant](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-\nfondacaro/2017/10/03/kimmel-gop-should-pray-god-forgive-them-helped-cause-\nshooting) touting confiscation and mauling those against his views as\nmonstrous. \"Jimmy Kimmel should not cheered for what he did last night. Jimmy\nKimmel should be asked to provide the evidence for his suppositions rather\nthan the evidence for his emotions. Again, I believe he's sincere. Sincerity\ndoes not make what you're saying smart,\" Shapiro argued at the end of his\npodcast, which featured over 20 minutes on Kimmel's post-Las Vegas shooting\nrant. Shapiro noted at the onset that \"Kimmel did something last night that I\nfind truly abhorrent\" which was discard any and all facts as part of his\neffort to \"become the social justice king of late-night television\" and \"all-\nheart representation of all leftist causes.\" Key highlights below: Shapiro on\nleftists dividing America: \"Last night, he did a long shitck about gun control\nthat was entirely based on emotion and it was really nasty. It was really\nnasty. I don't think it was nasty because he doesn't care. He cares. It's\nreally nasty because he's suggesting that you and I don't care. It doesn't\nmatter that you lost sleep last night and I lost sleep because of what\nhappened. It doesn't matter that we're all heartbroken over what happened. We\ndon't agree with Jimmy Kimmel's evidence-less suggestions about gun control.\nThat means that we don't care. We are bad people. You want to know why the\ncountry is not unified? It's because of stuff like this. It's not because we\ndisagree on policy. We've been disagreeing about policy forever. It's because\nthere are certain people in the American public discourse who feel it\nnecessary to impute bad motives to people who disagree and that's what\nKimmel's doing here.\" Shapiro on Kimmel's take about AR-15s: \"So, number one,\nthe Founders would have wanted us to have AR-15s because the fact is, back in\nthe day, all the weapons that people had were military grade weapons, right? A\nmusket was a military-grade weapon. Now, AR-15s aren't military grade…Civilian\nguns are very different from military-issued guns. For him to say the Second\nAmendment doesn't cover things like AR-15s -- a semi-automatic rifle, is akin\nto me saying the First Amendment doesn't cover TV because the Founders hadn't\nseen a TV, would never know what it'd look like, and don't understand how it\nworks. It's a silly argument. As far as the idea that ARs aren't used for home\ndefense, again, asinine. I have a bunch of friends who use ARs for home\ndefense.\" Sponsored Sponsored\n\n",

In case you're not\naware, the confusing conundrum first began when Dr. Bradstreet was found dead\nexactly one year ago - yes, on Father's Day - in the U.S. The noted autism\ndoctor, researcher, and parent was found in a river with a gunshot wound to\nthe chest. While authorities at first thought his death was a result of\nsuicide, it has since been confirmed that Dr. Bradstreet was murdered and that\nthe wound was not self-inflicted. His family, like the families of many other\nmissing and dead naturopathic practitioners and MD doctors, believe that he\nwas murdered for using and promoting controversial therapies, such as GCMaF.\nAccording to Elizabeth, nearly 50 doctors have now died or gone missing under\nmysterious circumstances. This riveting finding has resulted in some exposure\non the topic - including articles by the New York Times, The Independent UK,\nand network affiliates such as ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, but the whole story - or\nthe many threads connecting the various murders- is not being told. For this\nreason, the activist took to the internet today, on the one-year-anniversary\nof the first of the mysterious deaths, to express how serious of a concern\nthese events are. Right now in the United States, consumers are being told\nthat they are not enough and that they must purchase more items on credit, eat\nhigh-fat, high-sugar foods, take prescription pills they cannot afford, and\nbuy into the fear-mongering propaganda. In effect, America - perceived to be\none of the most \"developed\" nations in the world - spends more on 'health\ncare' than any other affluent nation, yet still has the worst state of health\nas a collective. Many suspect this is because a small elite controls the\nmajority of corporations and mediaand, in effect, the government. Unhealthy\nideals are being pushed on the public for the sake of profit. In fact,\naccording to one Berkeley doctor, conventional treatments for concerns such as\ncancer are less effective than forgoing treatment in the first place. Of\ncourse, if the public knew that eating healthier, getting exercise, thinking\npositive thoughts, simplifying their life, and letting go of toxic people and\nsituations would dramatically transform their health, the world would be a\nmuch different place. It seems that health practitioners that promote the idea\nthat every individual can be their own doctor by taking responsibility for\ntheir own health rather than waiting for emergency medicine are being\ntargeted, as they are going against a system which is corrupt and toxic. Click\nKEEP READING to read the full story. Or, at least, that's what [Elizabeth's\nfindings have concluded](http://www.healthnutnews.com/recap-on-my-unintended-\nseries-the-holistic-doctor-deaths/). The activist's attention on this topic\nmay have earned her - and her colleagues - death threats, but the efforts have\npaid off. A documentary is actually being made to shed more light on the\nmysterious deaths, and more information on that up-and-coming film will soon\nbe shared. Below is a detailed timeline of 34 doctors' deaths within the last\nyear. We'll let you be the judge on whether or not the untimely demise of many\nof these practitioners is fate or suspect. What matters most is that if these\ndoctors were killed because they're practicing true medicine, the injustice is\nuncovered and the parties responsible pay for their crimes. 1) June 19th, 2015\n[Dr. Bradstreet formerly of Florida, and now practicing in Georgia, was found\nwith a gunshot wound to his chest in a\nriver.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/famous-florida-autism-researcher-and-\ndoctor-jeff-bradstreet-died-of-alleged-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-and-found-\nin-a-river/) The small town locals ruled the death almost immediately as a\nsuicide, but many have their doubts. This same day in Mexico, June 19th, 2015,\nthree doctors were traveling to the State Capital to deliver some papers and\nwere reported missing. This is the only case outside of the U.S. Authorities\nsaid they found the bodies, but the families say those bodies look nothing\nlike their family members and they are demanding more proof and more testing.\n[A sad but riveting article was written about those details\nhere.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/where-are-mexicos-dead-doctors-families-\nfear-a-cover-up-like-iguala/) [I also did an exclusive interview with the\nBradstreet family](http://www.healthnutnews.com/video-dr-jeffrey-bradstreets-\nfamily-breaks-silence-for-the-first-time-since-his-tragic-death/) as they\npublicly said I was the only journalist they trusted to talk about the\nhorrific incident. 2) June 21st, 2015 Father's Day, Florida East Coast: Two\nchiropractors are found dead. Their names are Dr. Baron Holt and Dr. Bruce\nHendendal, both fathers. Dr. Hedendal also held a PhD in nutrition from\nHarvard. Both were presumably healthy and described as very fit. There is\nstill no cause of death listed, for either doctor in any articles we find. [A\nfew people have contacted me about Dr. Hedendal, 67, but admit that they were\nsurprised by his death and still find it\nshocking.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/3rd-alternative-prominent-doctor-from-\nflorida-found-dead-in-2-weeks-authorities-say-md-was-murdered/) (Update:\nFamily and loved ones of Dr. Hedendal have spoken to the media that they are\nsuspicious of his death and want answers. Interestingly, Dr. Holt (33), lived\nin North Carolina which is the state where Dr. Bradstreet's body (the first\ndoctor to be found) was discovered two days prior. Dr. Holt was visiting\nJacksonville, Florida, though, when he died there. Dr. Bradstreet (see story\n#1) was living in Georgia at the time of his death and before that he lived in\nthe neighboring state of Florida. [A few mutual friends of Dr. Holt have\ncontacted me. They are doctors and have shared with me a cause of\ndeath](http://www.healthnutnews.com/fifth-holistic-alternative-\ndoctor-33-found-dead-in-florida-making-5-dead-and-5-more-missing-doctors/)\nthat I find rather shocking and cannot confirm, therefore, out of respect for\nthe family, I will not list that here. Both were well loved by their patients,\ncommunity, friends and family.) 3) June 29th, 2015 [The beloved holistic\nTheresa Sievers, MD was found murdered](http://www.healthnutnews.com/3rd-\nalternative-prominent-doctor-from-florida-found-dead-in-2-weeks-authorities-\nsay-md-was-murdered/) in her home. Her co-worker says she was known as the\n\"Mother Teresa of South Florida.\" Her husband and children were in Connecticut\nat a family reunion when she was murdered. The authorities have been\ninvestigating for two weeks \"around the clock,\" and now say that she was\ntargeted. Her murder was not random nor was it a home invasion and when the\nfacts come out, \"books and movies will be written about it.\" It's that big of\na story. [On the very same day, June 29th, Jeffrey Whiteside, MD, a\npulmonologist, went missing- vanishing when he simply \"walked\naway\".](http://www.healthnutnews.com/2-more-doctors-d-o-m-d-go-missing-\nafter-3-found-dead-in-2-weeks/) Dr. Whiteside, known for his successful\ntreatment of lung cancer, disappeared in Door County, Wisconsin while\nvacationing with family. He was on foot and numerous reports have called it\n\"mysterious,\" saying he vanished without a trace. They've been searching now\nfor three weeks and even colleagues have joined in (along with bloodhounds,\ndrones search parties, and helicopters) but not one shred of evidence has\nsurfaced. (UPDATE: Two [arrests were made in the death of Teresa Sievers and\none of the assailants called himself the\n\"Hammer\"](http://www.healthnutnews.com/breaking-missouri-man-jimmy-rodgers-\naka-hammer-being-charged-with-the-murder-of-holistic-md-teresa-sievers/) on\nFacebook (Dr. Sievers was allegedly killed with a hammer). The other was one\nof her husband's childhood friends who was just recently extradited to\nFlorida. His attorney says there is evidence to show he had no involvement\nwhatsoever with the crime. Her husband, Mark Sievers, has not been arrested at\nthis time.) 4) July 3, 2015 [Patrick Fitzpatrick, MD goes\nmissing.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/2-more-doctors-d-o-m-d-go-missing-\nafter-3-found-dead-in-2-weeks/) He was traveling from North Dakota to\nneighboring Montana (which he did often as his son lives there) and his truck\nand trailer were found on the side of the road. The search has expanded but\nauthorities say it's as if he vanished without a trace. He's 6′ tall and\ndescribed as Irish-looking with a goatee (details can be found in the links).\n5) July 10th, 2015 [Lisa Riley, 34 years old, DO (Doctor of Osteopathic\nmedicine) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her\nhead.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/breaking-4th-doctor-an-md-found-dead-\ngunshot-wound-to-head/) Her husband who found her and called 911, has a prior\nrecord. He was previously charged with the attempted murder of his ex, Ms.\nKing, before charges were eventually dropped. Evidence showed that there was\ngun residue found on Ms. King's hand and not Mr. Riley's. Riley's story\ncorroborated this, but King's allegedly didn't, and her story kept changing\n(click link in this paragraph for their story with details on all of this).\nMr. Riley has since been charged with the death of his wife, Lisa Riley. We'll\nsee what happens in court. Prev Next 6) July 19, 2015 A month to the day after\nthe first doctor (Jeff Bradstreet, MD) was found dead with a gunshot wound to\nhis chest, [Dr. Ron Schwartz was found murdered in his E. Coast Florida\nhome.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/md-found-murdered-inside-florida-home-\ntoday-this-makes-6-in-30-days-5-still-missing/)Sadly, he was shot to death. We\ndon't know if he was holistic, but he was licensed and lived between Florida\nand Georgia. He was a gynecologist who lived in an unincorporated part of\nJupiter, Florida on a few acres of land and there are reports he ran an\norganic lawn service on the side. 7) July 21, 2015 Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, a\nholistic MD, dies suddenly. The same day another holistic doctor is also found\ndead (see below). They both allegedly died of heart attacks, though their own\nfriends and family say publicly it doesn't add up. I had met Dr Gonzalez and\nhis amazing wife, and my better half has interviewed him several times. His\nofficial website says that while they initially thought it was a heart attack,\nhis autopsy does not support that belief and shows no heart attack. They are\nawaiting further tests. \"Dr Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his\npassing is quite unexpected.\" It is reported that he was alone at the time of\nhis death. Countless people every week (including close friends) write me\nquestioning the fact that he died \"naturally\". He also said in several\ninterviews (including the last one before he died) that [he thought big pharma\nwanted him to get hit by a bus or that he might die\nsuddenly](http://www.healthnutnews.com/holistic-md-nick-gonzalez-who-died-\nsuddenly-said-hed-heard-big-pharma-hopes-he-gets-hit-by-a-bus/). Frightening\nmetaphors and a mystery we hope to get to the bottom of soon. 8) July 21st,\n2015 [Dr Abdul Karim, an outspoken and loved holistic (biological) dentist, 41\nyears of age, is found dead alongside the road by a\npasserby](http://www.healthnutnews.com/holistic-fit-dentist-41-dies-suddenly-\nof-massive-heart-attack-while-jogging/). He had been preparing for a half\nmarathon and was allegedly out training that night. His old fraternity brother\n(lifelong friends), friends of many years, and patients said it didn't add up.\nHe was in perfect shape and ate an extremely healthy diet. Mainstream news\nsaid he had a \"massive heart attack\" but many who knew him have written to me\nwith their sincere doubts. 9) July 23, 2015 Authorities announce they have\nfound the body of Dr Jeffrey Whiteside who [has been missing for over 3\nweeks.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/2-more-doctors-d-o-m-d-go-missing-\nafter-3-found-dead-in-2-weeks/) Chief Deputy Pat McCarty said at the news\nconference on Thursday that a .22 caliber gun was recovered at the scene.\nInvestigators believe the body was there for \"some time\". 10) August 12, 2015\n[Osteopath Mary Bovier is found slain to death in her\nhome](http://www.healthnutnews.com/10th-doctor-osteopath-found-slain-in-her-\nhome/) in Pennsylvania. Her significant other, who we are told is also an\nosteopath, was questioned and released. At this time there have been no\narrests and there are no suspects. 11) August 18, 2015 I report that [Jeffrey\nWhiteside's death is officially ruled as a\nsuicide](http://www.healthnutnews.com/doctors-death-just-ruled-as-suicide-\nlocal-news-calls-investigation-a-mess/) but the local press calls the\ninvestigation a \"mess\" (described here in detail). Many are shocked at how\nlong it took for details to emerge and countless people write me with their\ndoubts. Even local authorities were asked by the local press if they'd heard\nof my stories. They admitted they had, but hadn't been contacted by the feds\non the case. 12) September 7, 2015 [I broke the news to the health community\nof 29 holistic doctors (also referred to in the German press as\nhomeopaths/ND's/psychiatrists) who were found\npoisoned](http://www.healthnutnews.com/us-news-some-30-holistic-practitioners-\nsuffer-amphetamine-poisoning-at-conference-say-they-knowingly-took-nothing/)\nby an overdose of a hallucinogenic drug. I've done several updates of the\narticles, using a German translator, but the whole story of what really\nhappened has still not been revealed. One thing most can agree on; it was a\nlarge overdose and mainstream German news reports that some were in \"life\nthreatening situations\" when dozens of ambulances and a helicopter arrived to\nthe chaotic scene. The good news? All lived and have allegedly made a full\nrecovery (though some had to be restrained for their safety for some time).\n13) September 16, 2015 I reported that our colleague, [best selling author and\nholistic MD, Mitch Gaynor, is found dead outside his country home; an hour or\nso from Manhattan where he practiced.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/famous-\nnyc-holistic-doctor-mitchell-gaynor-md-found-dead/) We knew Dr Gaynor and had\njust finished an advanced copy of his book that he had sent to us. It was\nquickly called a suicide by the local sheriff. The NY Times wrote me asking\nfor details and we had a nice exchange. Even though I have gently broken the\nnews on this and many other stories, the NY Times fails to source me (I didn't\nexpect them to source HealthNutNews, though the Guardian UK and other\nmainstream sources have for some time). UPDATE: Mitch Gaynor, MD had been on\nRT not long before he died. [We wanted to contact them for comment, but soon\nafter Mitch was found dead? the founder of RT was found dead in his Washington\nDC hotel room.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/founder-of-rt-news-discovered-\ndead-in-washington-dc-hotel-room/) 14) Sunday October 11th [We announce that\nDr Marie Paas is found dead of an alleged\nsuicide](http://www.healthnutnews.com/12th-holistic-doctor-found-dead-alleged-\nsuicide/). She was well known for her animal advocacy. People on her Facebook\npage seemed shocked and in disbelief about her death. Unlike the 3 others by\nthis date who were alleged suicides (one who has been officially confirmed) we\ndon't know the location where Dr Paas was found, nor the details of her\nalleged suicide. Many seem concerned for her pets, who they say she loved very\nmuch. Prev Next 15) October 29th 2015 Jerome E. Block, M.D, jumped to his\ndeath from Central Park West residence. Authorities say Block jumped from the\n20th floor of his residence around 9:30 a.m. [Details and video can be found\nhere.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/thirteenth-holistic-doctor-md-phd-found-\ndead-allegedly-jumped-out-20th-floor-window/) 16) 2015 dozen plus accidental\ndeaths and freak accidents, mostly holistic doctors ;besides the 13 doctors\ncovered thus far who died in non accidental deaths, we have [5 chiropractor\ndeaths](http://www.healthnutnews.com/5-chiropractors-die-in-car-\naccidents-3-in-june-3-single-car-accidents/)that were accidents. We also have\nmore deaths of doctors here: [some described as freak\naccidents.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/fit-vegan-cardiologist-dies-in-freak-\naccident-florida-md-dies-while-jogging-saturday-more/) Again, we didn't\ninclude them in the official unintended series. We have the [famous holistic\nABC News doctor, Jamie Zimmerman, who allegedly slipped and\nfell](http://www.healthnutnews.com/31-yo-holistic-md-best-selling-author-\nfound-dead-in-hawaii/) and hit her head in Hawaii while on vacation, and who\nwas carried out to sea. We also have [more accidental deaths of holistic\ndoctors here in NY (accidental)](http://www.healthnutnews.com/holistic-new-\nyork-md-hit-killed-by-drunk-driver-in-long-island/), and yet [another\nhere](http://www.healthnutnews.com/holistic-md-just-killed-in-what-truly-\nappears-to-be-a-tragic-accident-rip/) of a famous holistic MD! We literally\ncouldn't keep up at times there were so many. 17) Late December 2015 January\n2016 I didn't include PhD's in the series (unless they were also an MD, DO or\nDC) but then just this past few weeks we saw 2 Canadian PhD's/researchers\nkilled. [One was stabbed in what his friends called a safe\nneighborhood](http://www.healthnutnews.com/2-doctors-walking-home-found-dead-\none-stabbed-to-death-in-safe-neighborhood/). Another, [a Phd (who was a wife\nand mother of two) was hit while jogging near the beach and then buried in a\nshallow grave](http://www.healthnutnews.com/dr-linnea-lora-veinotte-killed-\nwhile-on-vacation-and-found-in-makeshift-grave/) on the tourist island of\nGrenada. Then days later a holistic doctor is also attacked there with his\nwife (physician's assistant) on this same tiny island of Grenada (see #18).\nThis is where we suddenly start seeing a spate of cancer researchers killed\nwhich hadn't happened previously and then suddenly we have a one every few\ndays. 18) January 23, 2016 A top MD, John Marshall, 49, who was a former 4th\ngeneration Marine, had served in Afghanistan, and had survival training, was\nfound dead in the Spokane river and they pulled his body out that day. He was\nsaid to be in great shape and was doing his usual run in Spokane, near the\nriver. [Authorities say he somehow must have fallen into the river and drowned\nand almost immediately said it was death by\ndrowning](http://www.healthnutnews.com/world-famous-missing-md-cancer-\nresearchers-body-found-spokane-river/). (UPDATE: Dr Marshall's wife (also a\ndoctor and surgeon) has hired her own investigator and is questioning the\nquick call by Seattle PD. Again, more families are questioning these deaths\nand what some find absurd rulings by authorities.) 19) January 25th, 2016 [Our\nown friend of ten long years, holistic doctor Rod Floyd, was found dead at his\nhome here in Florida. He just miles from us and I'd been to their home and\nthey'd been to mine.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/our-local-holistic-friend-\ndoctor-found-dead-we-are-shocked-saddened-rip/) It was definitely not suicide\nin any way and his wife of 37 years says he was \"hearty and healthy\" and calls\nit an accident. That's all I'll elaborate on right now, as even I don't know\nall the details. Dr Floyd did buy a sauna from me (but that wasn't involved in\nhis death which I was told initially). Besides being a chiropractor, Dr Floyd\nwas also a clinical professor at Palmer Chiropractor College near where we\nlive. He and his wife have also run the Natural Awakenings magazine for some\ntime. Our whole community is shocked and saddened by his death. 20) January\n26, 2016 Believe it or not [just a few short weeks later, a holistic MD and\nhis wife (a physician's assistant) were attacked, while on a relaxing beach\nstroll, by a sword wielding man in the same place- the tiny island of\nGrenada](http://www.healthnutnews.com/another-doctor-killed-in-grenada-in-\nless-than-a-month/). The holistic MD survived. Sadly his wife was murdered and\nraped by the machete wielding attacker. Both perps in each attack of the\ndoctors in Grenada in a couple of weeks are reported to have been recently\nreleased from prison and in both crimes (allegedly unrelated) the men just\nnonchalantly turned themselves in after the crime. Some experts have their\ntheories on this. I won't elaborate at this time. Grenada locals are shocked\nand say they've never seen anything like this- let alone twice in a row. 21)\nJanuary 28th, 2016 The new spate of cancer researcher/doctors who are killed\nor found dead doesn't slow down and this might be the strangest of them all:\n[Yet another cancer researcher, Professor Alan Clarke, 52, was found dead in\nthe wood in hanging from a tree in a rubber body suit on December 28th, 2015\nand they ruled it accidental.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/top-leading-\ncancer-scientist-found-dead-in-found-dead-in-woods-in-rubber-fetish-suit/) 22)\nFebruary 1, 2016 Just a week later, to the day, after losing [our local friend\nand holistic doctor; Rod Floyd](http://www.healthnutnews.com/our-local-\nholistic-friend-doctor-found-dead-we-are-shocked-saddened-rip/) we lost\nanother local friend also right here in our same local holistic community.\n[The wonderful young Paige Adams FNP, B-C, also lived just up the road here\nlocally in Florida was found dead at her\nhome.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/dr-bradstreets-close-colleague-my-\nfriendneighbor-found-dead-here-in-florida/) She had worked closely for many\nyears with her good friend and colleague Dr Bradstreet. The problem is Dr\nBradstreet started off this whole holistic series when he was found dead in a\nriver. Now we have his close friend (and our friend!) and his colleague of\nmany years found dead. She was so young so this is particularly heartbreaking.\nPaige Adams had asked to stop by the house to see us days before she died. I\nfeel awful for not taking her up on that, and my heart goes out to her family\nand patients. She is the only one in this entire series I've ever written\nabout who is not a doctor of some sort (DC, MD, DO, and even a PhD at the end)\nBut she was a board certified Nurse Practitioner whose patients rave about her\nendlessly. She also stated publicly (which you'll see in the link) that if\nanything happened to her don't assume it was an accident. 23) February 14,\nValentine's Day [Cancer HIV Researcher in Seattle- Cheryl Deboer is found dead\nin a culvert with a plastic bag over her\nhead.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/chemist-at-cancer-research-lab-found-dead-\nin-woods/) Investigators quickly state they can't see any evidence that it's a\nhomicide, but her mother and other relatives state publicly there is no way\nshe crawled 1.5 miles through brambles and water and mud to put a plastic bag\nover her head in a culvert. They stated that if she would have wanted to take\nher life (and listed plenty of reasons why she wouldn't with a happy family\nand job at the famous cancer research lab) she could have done it much more\neasily. The general public tends to agree with the family. Families are now\nstarting to question these ridiculous statements called so quickly by local\nauthorities. Some are hiring their own investigators and doubting local\nauthorities. Many are wondering if the local authorities are to be trusted.\nPrev Next 24) March 10, 2016 [Yet another cancer researcher found dead in a\nfield. He was only 34,](http://www.healthnutnews.com/34-year-old-doctor-\ncancer-researcher-found-dead-in-field/) and found in a safe quaint area in the\ncountryside and people are astounded. Nearly immediately authorities announce\nhis death is 'not suspicious', but there is a public outcry of how that could\nbe so. We still have zero answers as to his cause of death. 25) March 23, 2016\nWednesday, Triple homicide: [Prominent Holistic doctor Henry Han, was found\nmurdered on his 7 acre Santa Barbara estate, along with his wife and daughter,\nonly 5 years of age.

His father was\nEX CIA. We will update as details emerge. 26) April 6, 2015 Dr Harsch, 59, a\nself described holistic medicine MD was killed while riding his bicycle with a\ngroup of friends. He was the only one hit and none of the others were injured\nwhatsoever. [See details here.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/another-holistic-\ndoctor-killed/)(Editor's note: We had another holistic doctor earlier in the\nseries also killed on a bicycle ride last year and many of her friends and\nloved ones contacted me about their concerns and questions on her death). 27)\nLast seen on February 12, 2016 [Dr Rose Polge,\n25](http://www.healthnutnews.com/the-only/) apparently walked off her job\nwhere she worked at Torbay Hospital in Devon, and was missing for almost two\nmonths. She allegedly wrote a letter to the Health Secretary about her\nfeelings on a political situation there with the doctors. [Police later\nrecovered her body from the sea more than 50\nmiles](http://www.healthnutnews.com/the-only/) away from where a hoodie\n(believed to belong to her) was found. There is now an inquest into her death\nafter post-mortem results proved inconclusive. 28) May 6th, 2016 A holistic\ndoctor and well known professor, Dr Rasmussen, 76, in the Boston area, was\nfound dead. She taught classes at a local University and discussed natural\nhealth, nutrition and biology, was [found stabbed to death in her home. She\nwas stabbed over 30 times](http://www.healthnutnews.com/holistic-\ndoctorprofessor-found-stabbed-to-death-in-home/) and no arrests have been made\nat this time. Not to be confused with the case of Pennsylvania Osteopath Mary\nBovier, [also found stabbed to death in her\nhome.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/10th-doctor-osteopath-found-slain-in-her-\nhome/) No arrests have been made in either murder. 29) March 14th, 2016 One of\nthe strangest cases yet is [holistic MD and acupuncturist Dr Clogston, 68, who\nwas missing 3 weeks and eventually found\ndead](http://www.healthnutnews.com/holistic-doctor-found-dead-after-missing-\nfor-weeks-2/) in his car which was allegedly found off the route some say he\ntook to work for 30 years. The peculiar part is Dr Clogston went missing on\nMarch 14, was reported missing on March 15, but then seen by someone who \"knew\nhim well\" according to local authorities (they say this on video on the news).\nSo how then- was he found dead weeks later in his car? Many would like to\nknow. This is one of the strangest to me out of around 40 mysterious deaths.\n30) May 6, 2016 Dr Suutari, an outspoken holistic doctor in the Los Angeles\narea, who had a beautiful family and new child, [allegedly took his own life\non Mother's day in the garage.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/breaking-\noutspoken-holistic-doctor-allegedly-commits-suicide-mothers-day/)Here are what\ndetails we know on this sad death. 31) May 19, 2016 Prominent investigator\nhired by Dr Marshall's wife (She's also an MD and a surgeon) and investigator\n[says on CBS news that the \"accidental death\" of Dr Marshall (that I reported\non first in January) is most likely a professionally staged murder by someone\nin military or police. A must watch…](http://www.healthnutnews.com/world-\nfamous-missing-md-cancer-researchers-body-found-spokane-river/) 32) June 13th\n2016 An arrest was made in the death of holistic doctor Mary Louise Yoder. The\ncurious part is that [Dr. Yoder actually died in or around July 22nd 2015\n(last year - a very busy week for holistic doctor\ndeaths)](http://www.healthnutnews.com/nbc-ny-holistic-doctor-thought-died-\nnaturally-poisoned/) and authorities almost immediately said she died of\nnatural causes despite being fit, uber healthy and just 60 years old. I did\nnot include her in the series originally since the authorities mistakenly said\nit was natural. So oftentimes we have authorities making these quick calls\nonly to find out later they were completely false (why the rush officers?) So\nfor months, Yoder's death was considered \"natural\" until reports say a family\nmember demanded an investigation. Now, this June, her employee (who was listed\nas her daughter on her obituary - they were so close) was arrested and it's\nsaid she poisoned her. The employee is only 23 years old and had said Yoder\nmeant the world to her. Keep updated on this story as new details may emerge.\n33) June 16, 2016 [A man stormed into a holistic doctor's office and gunned\nthe man down and then turned the gun on himself - taking both their\nlives.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/murder-suicide-gunmen-kills-holistic-\ndoctor/) A client walked in and saw them on the ground with a woman who worked\nthere screaming. The very next day - see #34) another man went into another\nholistic doctor's office and killed him. These could be total coincidence, but\nwe report all mysterious murders/suicides/unexplained sudden deaths of\nholistic doctors so are including them on this recap. 34) June 17, 2016\n[Another man stormed into a holistic doctor's office (just a day later) and\nmurdered the alternative MD in cold blood with a\nknife.](http://www.healthnutnews.com/another-holistic-doctor-murdered-\nclinic-2-doctors-2-days/) The victim was Dr. Tiejun Huang Ph.D./MD R.Ac, RMT,\nDTCM. Dr Huang was a sports medicine specialist at the Beijing Olympic Games,\na professor in sports medicine and rehabilitation and performs acupuncture and\nChinese \"Tuina\" massage. You can read all the details here. Dr Huang allegedly\nknew his assailant (authorities said immediately) but we had a holistic doctor\ngunned down by a man the day before in his office (see #33) who they say knew\nhis assailant too. 2 holistic doctors in under 2 days murdered in their\noffices does raise eyebrows.

Want to advertise with Turtleboy?\nEmail us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more information. [ Beautiful day\noutside. Perfect weather for Worcester's Mayor Moron, Joe Petty, to do a\nstandout with his communist friend Red Danny Margolis: Ya got that? The mayor\nof the second largest city in Worcester is working hand in hand with a guy who\n](https://www.facebook.com/PepesItalianPizza/)admittedly is trying to foment\ncommunist revolution, and targeted black churches because he believed they\nwere vulnerable. This ain't McCarthyism hyperbole either. Red Danny freely\nadmits it all. Check out his [Wiki page](http://keywiki.org/Dan_Margolis):\n\"Dan Margolis was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1976. In 2006 he was\nchair of the New York State [Communist Party\nUSA](http://keywiki.org/Communist_Party_USA). In addition he writes for the\n[People's World](http://keywiki.org/People%27s_World), covering local New York\nCity and state issues, as well as events at the United Nations. He joined the\n[Communist Party USA](http://keywiki.org/Communist_Party_USA) in 2001.\" He has\nhis [own page on the American Communist Party's\nwebsite](http://www.cpusa.org/authors/dan-margolis-3/). According to his bio\non there, his plan is to support people like Mayor Petty, because this is\ngenerally what communists do: \"The Communist Party can exercise a leadership\nrole by helping to show the importance of electing or defending Democrats as\npart of an overall strategy on the road towards socialism.\" Communism only\nappeals to people in impoverished areas where they have given up and believe\ncapitalism has failed them. Thus why Mayor Petty seems inclined on making\nWorcester's people trapped in cycles of poverty. It's why he wants to make\nWorcester a sanctuary city - so we can lose $59 million in federal funding.\nRed Danny was pumped when Obama won, and as the chairman of the Communist\nParty of New York, he gave the following statement, claiming that this was the\n\"biggest continuation of that revolutionary spirit\": Where he expressed how\nbad he thinks the collapse of communism has been for the Russian people:\nSoviet Union obviously had problems, but now there are drugs, poverty, and\nunemployment. Life has gotten worse for the Russian people. Gangsters are\nrunning the streets. Actually, now Communist Parties are voted back to power\nby the people in such places like Moldova, Belarus, and Chech Republic. People\ndidn't like the shock therapy that Yeltsin had introduced. Boris Yeltsin once\nstood on a tank and protected the legitimate government from armed communists\ntrying to stage a coups. Naturally Dan is not a fan of Boris Yeltsin. All of\nthis information is public. Just a Google away for any responsible leader. Joe\nknows exactly who Red Danny is but he employs him on his campaign team anyway\nbecause he's a useful idiot. One of his \"morons.\" He knows that Red Danny has\nhis own blog where he makes up lies about Turtleboy Sports raping girls and\nblah, blah, blah. He also knows that Red Danny is OBSESSED with Councilor\nMichael Gaffney. And together Turtleboy and Gaffney are a HUGE threat to\nPetty's grip on the taxpayer's money. He ain't giving that up without a fight,\nand he has no problem using communist revolutionaries. There's a good chance\nhe actually HIRED Dan to write his silly little blogs. Don't worry though -\nwithin a couple days he'll write another blog denying that Petty hired him. He\na good soldier like that. But a picture doesn't lie: Oh, and did we mention\nthat Dan Margolis is also running the failed Turtleboycott campaign that\nharasses local businesses? The same businesses that Mayor Moron claims he\nwants to attract and keep in the city. Here's the best part - he [voted for\nhis buddy Red Danny to be appointed to the Library\nBoard](http://www.telegram.com/news/20170531/city-hall-notebook-worcester-\ncouncilor-king-wants-middle-school-sports-re-established) on May 31 when he\nthought no one was looking: The City Council Tuesday night elected Daniel M.\nMargolis of 15 Rugby St. to the Worcester Public Library Board of Directors.\nMr. Margolis was one of three candidates who sought to fill a vacancy on the\nlibrary for for a term that expires on Dec. 31, 2019. Mr. Margolis received\nsix votes, followed by Edward R. Carr who received four votes and Paul DePalo\nwho received one vote. The two people who Red Danny beat? [Edward R. Carr has\na PhD](https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/facultybio.cfm?id=1037) and is a\nprofessor at Clark. [Paul DePalo is a lawyer with 12 years of\nexperience](http://www.lawyers.com/worcester/massachusetts/paul-m-\ndepalo-4587402-a/). Both of them are much, much more qualified than Red Danny,\nand unlike him they didn't just move here last year after failing to foment\nrevolution in New York City. Yet Mayor Puddy voted for his unqualified boy.\nBecause this is how they gain legitimacy in our government. The rats get in\nthis way. They sneak in the backdoor when no one is looking, and Petty\norchestrates the whole thing. Not just him either - Councilors Khrystian King,\nKate Toomey, George Russell, Tony Economou, and Candy Carlson all voted for\nhim as well. Every single one of them has the power to Google, and they all\nread Turtleboy. They knew EXACTLY who they were voting for. And yes, you read\nthat right - Sarai \"Titi Ho\" Rivera did not vote to put Danny in. Even though\nhe's got her back till the cows come home: This is the state of the city right\nnow. People like Red Danny are allowed to serve in our government - an\nadmitted, openly communist revolutionary. People like Etel Haxhiaj get\nappointed to the CAC under Petty's watch, and deny ANYONE who \"supports\"\nTurtleboy Sports a job they are overly qualified for on city boards. Make no\ndoubt about it - Petty is the mastermind here. Red Danny, Etel, Mosaic - these\nare just his goons. Because Petty does a great job of convincing everyone he's\nthis \"nice guy\" because he doesn't get his hands dirty. Some people thinks\nGaffney is a dick because he fights his own battles. Not Petty though. He just\noutsources to labor to nudniks with nothing to lose like Red Danny. But make\nno doubt about it - Dan Magolis is his right hand man and by far his biggest\nasset. This is what a vote for Mayor Moron is a vote for in November. Vote the\nTurtleboy Ticket: Mayor - Mike Gaffney Councilors at Large: Gaffney, Konnie\nLukes D3: Davis Assare D4: Coreen Gaffney D5: Paul Franco School Committee:\nEveryone except Dante Comparetto.

            "input": "\"There's something happening here.\" -- Buffalo Springfield, 1967 Every major\nleftist movement the world has seen has been totalitarian by nature.\nOccasionally this brand of extremism arises elsewhere along the ideological\nspectrum, such as Islamo-fascism, but Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany remain\nthe archetypes of the socialist genre of dictatorship among many incarnations\nwhich clearly include today's \"liberal Democrats\" in the United States.\nContemporary liberal Democrats reveal their totalitarian proclivities in many\nsubtle ways, such as support for single-payer healthcare and all other forms\nof big government, and some that are not so subtle. Recent years have seen a\nsurge in the latter variety. Shouting down conservative speakers on college\ncampuses to silence their views has been ongoing, but now the practice has\ngraduated to violent attacks on speakers and audiences. There is no record of\ncomparable suppression of speech by conservatives. And why is it only the left\nthat abides no dissent from its preferred orthodoxy? The adherents expose\nthrough their own behavior that they fear a fair debate of ideas, so they\nattempt to quell intellectual challenge through brute force--just as all\nautocrats do. America's so-called liberal Democrats resort to the most\naggressive tactics out of the Saul Alinsky manual, i.e., destroy any threat to\nthe radical agenda. Truth is beside the point to them. To substantiate via\nillustration of such Stalinist \"politics of personal destruction,\" here are a\nfew examples: (1) Mitt Romney, as 2012 presidential candidate, was Mr. Nice\nGuy until Democrats got ahold of him. Then the public found out that he had\nabused his dog, caused an employee to die of cancer, and sadistically\nimprisoned women in a torture device known as a binder! All this derived from\nthe Obama campaign's suitably-named \" [kill\nRomney](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/08/kill-romney-060929)\" strategy.\nOf course, candidate Obama's own personal history was deemed off-limits.\nHypocrisy is a familiar trait of leftist totalitarians. (2) Poor George W.\nBush. Investigations by three different governmental commissions concluded\nthat he did not lie about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. If anything, he\nreceived the same information worldwide intelligence agencies did about\nSaddam's WMD arsenal. Yet \"Bush lied\" was burned into the national\nconsciousness through liberal Democrat propaganda, paving the way for election\nof a true leftist president. (3) Barack Obama advanced the practice of\ndespotic repression by weaponizing every office of his government for domestic\npolitical use. The IRS campaign of terror against conservative groups was only\none of the most obnoxious. Richard Nixon received an article of impeachment\nfor much less. (4) The grand master of personal destruction politics was Bill\nClinton, who slimed anyone seen as a threat whether James McDougal, Ken Starr,\nor Juanita Broaddrick. This m.o. was the whole point of the \"war room\" of\nClinton's permanent campaign, not to mention Hillary's [\"bimbo eruption\"\nsquad](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/yes-hillary-was-an-\nenabler-213919). A colorful couple, those Clintons. Hillary, in particular,\nwas a disciple of leftist Saul Alinsky. (5) Currently we have liberal Democrat\nrioters, following the Occupy Wall Street slow-motion riot. Black Lives Matter\nextremists demand the murder of police, and the misnamed Antifa ironically\nlives the fascist ideal of causing mayhem whenever someone utters a thought\ncontrary to liberal Democrat political correctness. After the first violent\nact by a right-wing fringe fanatic in many years, in Charlottesville, the fake\nnews narrative is that conservatives are the violent ones. In reality, almost\nall political violence in this country is committed by the far left (for\nexample, a Bernie Sanders-supporting maniac actually attempting to assassinate\nRepublican members of Congress). (6) A telling symptom of the left's nascent\ndespotism is the public shaming of any entity that disagrees with them, e.g.,\norganizing against businesses that violate leftist dogma by supporting a\ntraditional position. For instance, dare to agree with the view on homosexual\nmarriage held until a few years ago by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and\nyou become a target. (Recall Alinsky's \"isolate it, freeze it, personalize\nit.\") Likewise, the revelations about leftist groups such as the Southern\nPoverty Law Center demonizing those they disagree with. The left decided long\nago to downplay debate over ideas--their ideology having failed empirically\nall over the world--and to simply use neo-McCarthyist tactics instead. (7) In\nAnimal Farm, some pigs really are more equal than others. Hillary Clinton was\nfound to have committed numerous email felonies, and then the gutless James\nComey said \"never mind.\" Clinton's Benghazi malfeasance with Barack Obama also\nhas gone unpunished. The political elite elevating itself above the law is a\nhallmark of leftist dictatorship. (8) One of the liberal Democrats' favorite\nslander devices is the accusation of racism, which has become the supreme\ninsult in our society. White-on-black racism, in particular, has become\nsocially unacceptable, which actually is a measure of how anti-racist America\nhas become in overcoming vestiges of its more primitive state. Recognize,\nhowever, that for the past 45 years, the only legally permissible, sometimes\nlegally mandated, racial discrimination in the U.S. is that which is committed\nin favor of minorities against Caucasians. This is the extreme state of our\nsocial law, for better or worse, yet many on the left trot out \"white\nsupremacist\" allegations more often than we can count. There is a more\nsubstantive reason for the liberal Democrat amalgam's resort to this odious\ntactic, beyond findings of its marketing effectiveness: Liberal Democrats\ncannot permit the mass healing of race relations in our country. They need to\naggravate those relations so their side is better able to exploit the issue.\nIs there no limit to their neo-McCarthyist cynicism? Politics is everything to\nliberal Democrats, because government power is everything to them. (9) Perhaps\nthe worst of the Big Lies was \"if you like your doctor, you can keep your\ndoctor,\" designed to give liberal Democrat government absolute life-and-death\npower over all citizens through the enactment of Obamacare. What better way to\nachieve totalitarian rule than mortal power over all the ruled people? See why\nsocialized medicine is the liberal Democrats' Holy Grail? A broader\nexplanation for the liberal Democrats' current hysteria: Their camp had some\nvery sinister plans for the country, and was oh-so-close to ultimate success.\nWith the election of President Hillary Clinton, a prospective second straight\nsubversive in the office, Democrats could have finally amnestied 11 million\nillegal aliens, i.e., new Democrat voters, thereby ensuring that no Republican\ncould ever again be elected president. This outcome would establish their goal\nof a one-party dictatorship, in effect―if only it had happened. The dream\nscenario having been snatched away is what has driven the liberal Democrats\nover the edge. So, in their delirium, they lash out. It is all understandable\nfor a group of closet totalitarians in the throes of catastrophic\ndisappointment. And if they tear the nation apart as they act out, so much the\nbetter, in their warped view. They always despised the country anyway. Now the\nplan is for arch-socialist Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren (who\nmisrepresented her own race for financial gain), to win the presidency in 2020\nfor a slightly postponed takeover. Pleasant dreams, America. There is\nsomething happening here. John Gaski is an associate professor at the Mendoza\nCollege of Business at the University of Notre Dame. He is a long-time\nregistered Democrat and long-time registered Republican--intermittently, not\nsimultaneously.

            "input": "[ Republicans knew what they were getting when they overwhelmingly voted for\nBruce Rauner. He made no secret of his support for abortion. In 2014, his\nwife, Diana Rauner, went so far as to take out an ad assuring pro-choice\nDemocrats of her husband's stance. Despite what you've been reading about the\nfar right's consternation with Bruce Rauner over his ostensible support for\nabortion in Illinois, I think it's been a pretty good month for the governor.\nThe union-busting Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal\nEmployees case that he initiated has made it to the Supreme Court. And he's\ngot liberal groups like Planned Parenthood praising him for his stance on\nreproductive rights. It looks like he may be able to put together the band of\nrabid right-wingers and abortion-rights moderates who helped elect him in the\nfirst place. I know that sounds like the oddest of coalitions--but it just\ngoes to show you what a clever politician can buy with his billions. The\nRepublican right-to-lifers are furious that Rauner flip-flopped and signed HB\n40, the reproductive rights bill that expanded Medicaid funding for some\nabortions and eliminated the controversial \"trigger provision\" from state law.\n(The trigger language would've made abortions illegal in Illinois should Roe\nv. Wade be overturned.) And many, including Steve Bannon, are talking about\nrecruiting someone to mount a primary challenge against Rauner. But I think\nit's mostly bluster. In fact, I can't understand why they're so outraged. They\nknew what they were getting when they overwhelmingly voted for Rauner back in\n2014. Rauner made no secret of his support for abortion. In 2014, his wife,\nDiana Rauner, went so far as to take out an ad assuring pro-choice Democrats\nthat when it came to abortion rights her husband would be no different than\nhis opponent, former governor Pat Quinn. Backed by many pro-choice moderates\nin DuPage County, the North Shore, and the Gold Coast, Rauner edged out Quinn\nand promptly went to work bankrupting public education by vetoing the budget.\nEarlier this year, the governor panicked when it looked as though he might be\nlosing support among downstate Republicans. So he assured right-to-life\nlegislators he would veto HB40. That enraged pro-choice voters, who claimed he\nwas betraying his lifelong commitment to their cause. Rauner found himself in\na jam. He had to decide which group he could least afford to alienate on the\neve of next year's election: Gold Coast and North Shore moderates or rabid\nRepublicans. Obviously, he went with the former, at least partly because, if\npush came to shove, they might actually vote for a Democrat. As for the rabid\nright, he probably figured he'd give 'em a tax break and they'd follow him off\na cliff. Of course, Rauner was slick about it. Over the summer he made a real\nshow of inviting various pro-choice women to his office to explain to him how\nimportant it was to pass HB40. And then on September 28, he signed it, making\na big deal about it, like he was King Solomon making a wrenching decision as\nopposed to a lifelong abortion supporter doing what he'd promised to do four\nyears ago. In any case, it seems to have worked. Key players in the pro-choice\nmovement fell for it. When Rauner signed HB40, Planned Parenthood of Illinois\nsent an e-mail calling on members to \"thank Governor Rauner.\" Puh-lease! A\nmore accurate response would've been \"Thanks for nothing, Bruce!\" Even if the\nstrategy fails and he doesn't win reelection, Rauner's in a perfect position\nto achieve his great dream of damaging, if not destroying, public unions in\nIllinois thanks to the Janus case. Mark Janus is a state employee who argues\nthat his First Amendment rights are being violated because state law requires\nhim to contribute a \"fair share\" portion of his paycheck to the union that\nrepresents him--in this case, the American Federation of State, County and\nMunicipal Employees. In particular, he doesn't think he should have to donate\nmoney to a union with which he disagrees politically. It's called a fair-share\ncontribution because the money guarantees that workers share the cost of\nfinancing a union that represents them in bargaining and grievance hearings.\nOn February 9, 2015, a few weeks after he took office, Rauner issued an\nexecutive order halting automatic fair-share deductions from paychecks.\nSeveral unions and attorney general Lisa Madigan sued and Rauner's executive\norder was overturned. Rauner also filed a suit in federal court seeking to\nstop automatic fair-share contributions on First Amendment grounds. In 2016, a\nfederal judge ruled against Rauner, decreeing that the governor didn't have\nstanding in the case. By then Janus had joined the case--as a state employee,\nhe clearly has standing. Janus is being represented by the National Right to\nWork Legal Defense Foundation, a union-busting outfit that's financially\nsupported by the Koch brothers, the Walton Family Foundation, and other\nstalwarts of the far right. On September 28, the Supreme Court agreed to hear\nJanus's case. The suit is similar to one filed by Rebecca Friedrichs, a\nteacher in California, who lost when the Supreme Court was deadlocked 4-4.\nSince then President Trump and the Senate have put conservative Neil Gorsuch\non the court. So unless another judge flips--c'mon Justice Kennedy, you can do\nit!--it looks like SCOTUS will issue a bruising blow against unions, which\nwill have to scramble to keep up their funding. This is a cruel irony on many\nlevels. For one thing, government employees such as Janus will be relatively\ndefenseless without unions if they're fired or harassed by a powerful\npolitician like Rauner. Good luck getting the National Right to Work\nFoundation to help them with that. As for Rauner's friends at Planned\nParenthood--well, with a drop in membership, unions will be less able to help\nelect Democrats. So really the assault on unions is an attempt to cripple the\nDemocratic Party. You don't think the Koch brothers actually give a hoot about\nworkers like Mark Janus, do you? If Democrats can't beat Republicans, they\ncan't enact liberal-minded measures, like--oh, just to pick one--reproductive\nrights. Think about this, Planned Parenthood. Your good friend, Bruce, is\nthrowing you under the bus once again. Only this time he's got a more\nroundabout way of doing it.\nv](https://media1.fdncms.com/chicago/imager/u/original/32566056/pasted_image_at_2017_10_17_03_04_pm.png)\n\n",

A\ndisturbing example of this trend can be seen in the case of British gymnast\nLouis Smith, who was punished this week by officialdom for showing\ninsufficient reverence towards Islam. The action against him by his\nprofessional body British Gymnastics arose after a video emerged of Smith and\nfellow gymnast Luke Carson joking about the religion at a private wedding in a\nNorthamptonshire hotel. In the footage which caused the furore Carson mimicked\nthe Islamic prayer practice and shouted \"Allah Akbar\", while Smith laughed at\nhis antics. For this behaviour Smith has been turned into a pariah. He has\nreceived death threats from jihadists and vilification from the media. On\nTuesday a disciplinary panel at British Gymnastics suspended him from\ncompetition for two months and warned him that the reprimand will stay on his\nrecord for two years. Smith committed no legal offence. Louis Smith holds his\nMember of the British Empire (MBE) medal in 2012 He did not physically hurt\nanyone but in today's Britain he is guilty of a thought crime by daring to\nindulge in religious satire. It is like a modern version of the Cromwellian\nregime that existed in the 17th century with its determination to crack down\non any signs of heresy, only now the faith held to be sacred and inviolable is\nnot Protestantism but Islam. In this new climate of creeping totalitarianism\nany mockery of the Muslim faith, even in private, will not be tolerated. The\nanachronistic law against blasphemy was meant to have been swept away in 2008\nbut the offence has returned with a vengeance due to the accelerating\nIslamification of Britain. Louis Smith has effectively been treated as a\nblasphemer against Islam and is now forced to undergo public penitence for his\nsins. He was hauled up in front of ITV's Loose Women, who had decided to\nappoint themselves as the guardians of the new official orthodoxy. One\npanellist, TV presenter June Sarpong, was ferocious in her condemnation,\naccusing Smith of racism, xenophobia and prejudice. But this goes to the heart\nof the problem with this case. His critics pretend that any kind of criticism\nof Islam is a form of racism or bigotry. Ola Jordan and Louis Smith on\nStrictly Come Dancing In the same vein Muslim leaders constantly talk of\n\"Islamophobia\" if any of their religious sensitivities are challenged. But\nIslam is not a race, it is a belief system, and like all faiths it should be\nopen to questioning, censure or humour. The idea that any religion, especially\none as controversial as Islam, should be above debate is repugnant. Religious\nfreedom is one of the cornerstones of our civilisation. The alternatives are\nabsolutist theocracy and violent sectarianism, precisely the characteristics\nof too many Muslim societies in the Middle East and Asia. In the wake of the\nLouis Smith incident the Muslim Council of Britain predictably bleated about\n\"Islamophobia\", arguing that British society must \"realise the need for people\nto follow their faith with dignity\". The council should also recognise the\nneed to abide by the values of our country, one of which is open discourse\nfree from clerical tyranny. It is disgraceful that British Gymnastics, like so\nmany other craven public authorities, is eager to do the work of the zealots.\nBy punishing Smith they are effectively endorsing the hardliners. The chief\nexecutive Jennie Allen said that competitors such as Smith and Carson should\n\"use their profile to have a positive impact on sport and communities\". Louis\nSmith in training The implication is that athletes must suspend their own\nopinions and instead act as evangelists for the ruling doctrine of political\ncorrectness. Equally offensive are the grotesque double standards. British\nGymnastics and the media would have never worked themselves up into such a\nfroth of phoney indignation if Smith had mocked Catholic prayer rituals. In\nfact Christianity is subject to constant attacks and satire without any\ndemands for disciplinary action. Joking about the Christian faith has long\nbeen a key ingredient of British comedy from Dave Allen to Father Ted. Nor\ndoes the state show much respect for Christian sensibilities, as highlighted\nby the case where a firm of devout bakers in Belfast was fined for refusing to\nmake a cake with a political slogan in favour of gay marriage. The reason for\nthis hypocrisy is simple: Islamic grievances and demands for special treatment\ncome cloaked with the menace of violence. \"Our religion will not be mocked\" is\na threat, not a plea. Tue, July 31, 2012 All the best pictures of British\nartistic gymnast Louis Smith Louis Smith with his silver medal The\nintimidation is real, as shown by the relentless catalogue of global slaughter\nagainst those deemed to have offended Islam. But instead of defending our\nfreedoms, Western rulers wallow in desperate appeasement dressed up as\ntolerance. The determination to punish Louis Smith is the flipside of\nofficialdom's impulse to surrender, as shown in the growing acceptance of\nsharia courts. As for Smith himself, he has embarked on a tour of abject\nrepentance, visiting a number of mosques where he claims to have discovered\n\"the true meaning behind the religion of peace\". In those words there is a\nchilling echo of the end of George Orwell's novel 1984: \"He had learnt to love\nBig Brother.\"\n\n",

It's not so easy to contemplate what makes so many people\nthink America's greatness is in desperate need of reformation, or what would\nmake them turn to someone like Donald Trump to make it a reality. America has\nflaws as deep as its founding, when the men who laid down basic principles of\nhuman rights - principles that have endured 240 years - were fed and clothed\nby human beings they owned. That paradox still defines the fault lines of our\nnation, and it's along those lines we are drawing the ugliest election in\nmodern history. It isn't just economic anxiety or trade deals or the opioid\nepidemic driving the mostly white, mostly male movement behind Trump's\ncampaign. It is the existential fear of displacement from a world that has\nslowly - too slowly, for too long - been chipping away at white male\nsupremacy. The \"grab 'em by the pussy\" moment was disastrous for Trump's\ncampaign; it reinforced the defining narrative of his sexism. But it drew his\nstrongest supporters even closer to him, because it reminded them of the world\nthey're losing. They want to live in an America where they can grab women by\nthe pussy and brag about it to their friends. They want to casually use the\nn-word - just for the bad ones; they're not racist! - without being set upon\nby the PC police. They want what's coming to them, what's owed them. And they\nare willing to burn down the world to get it. Donald Trump is the worst major-\nparty candidate for president in American history. This is not a close call.\nBy virtually any measure, he is unfit to lead a Cub Scout troop, let alone the\nnation with the world's most powerful military. It's worth going back and\nreading the [transcripts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-\nfix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-\nannotated/) [of his debates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-\nfix/wp/2016/10/09/everything-that-was-said-at-the-second-donald-trump-vs-\nhillary-clinton-debate-highlighted/) [with Hillary\nClinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/19/the-final-\ntrump-clinton-debate-transcript-annotated/) just to remember how he speaks\nwhen he's answering questions off the cuff. It's breathtaking how incapable he\nis of forming a single coherent thought. The expectations for him were so low\nthat there was little to no coverage of his failure over four-and-a-half hours\nto say anything intelligent about any issue important to the American people.\nHe meanders, he interrupts, and he whines. He is uninformed and unprepared.\nTrump's values are, in a word, deplorable. He launched his campaign calling\nMexican immigrants rapists, issued a call for a ban on immigration by Muslims,\nand said women should be punished for getting an abortion. He lies,\nconstantly, about everything. He stokes anger and fear and even violence among\nhis supporters. He nurtures their very worst instincts. He brags he has the\nbest temperament, but that's nonsense. He's lashed out and punched down,\nattacking the parents of a dead soldier, a former beauty pageant winner who\ngained weight, countless reporters and anyone he perceives as insulting him.\nIt is impossible to predict exactly how deep a disaster Donald Trump's\npresidency would be, but there's no limit to the potential for horror. Think\nhow much we still don't know about Trump - how he hasn't released his taxes,\nhow many women there likely are who haven't come forward - and you can imagine\nthe scandals and corruption that lie in wait. Consider how thin his policy\nknowledge is and how impulsively he reacts to insults, and imagine his twitchy\nlittle fingers on the nuclear button. Donald Trump cannot be president of the\nUnited States. And while Trump has a considerable movement of supporters who\nsee him as a great conquering hero, who believe every word of his lies, no\nmatter how outlandish and easily disproven, there are many people, even at\nthis late hour, who are torn about whether they can support him. Maybe they're\ndeeply conservative Republicans who despise what they believe Clinton would do\nto the country. Maybe they're independents who see constant stories about her\nemails and have genuine fears about her judgment. But now is the moment for\nevery last American to decide what it truly means to be a citizen. You can be\nreluctant about Hillary Clinton. You don't even have to vote for her (though I\ndid, without doubt or hesitation). What you cannot do is vote for Donald Trump\nand pretend that this is just another election, and he is just another\ncandidate. It is your minimum duty as a citizen not to support a racist,\nsexist, unqualified, dishonest, corrupt manchild who celebrates everything\nthat's ugly about America and not a single thing that's great about it. No\nmatter how left out or left behind you feel, voting for Trump is nothing short\nof a moral failure. It's a vicious act against the human beings, mostly women\nand people of color, who would suffer miserably under his presidency. It's an\nact of violence against America itself, whose greatness has always been about\nprogressing from more oppression to less - slowly, sometimes haltingly, but\nforward.  The promise on those red hats is to turn back in the other\ndirection. The greatness they sell is a lie. Watch Donald Trump's acceptance\nspeech after becoming the new President-elect of the United States.\n\n",

            "input": "Donald Trump has virtually stopped trying to win this election by any\nconventional metric and is instead stacking logs of grievance on the funeral\npyre with the great anticipation of setting it ablaze if current polls turn\nout to be predictive. There is something calamitous in the air that surrounds\nthe campaign, a hostile fatalism that bespeaks a man convinced that the end is\nnear and aiming his anger at all within reach. As his path to victory grows\nnarrower, his desperation grows more pronounced. Last week a steady stream of\nwomen stepped forward to accuse Trump of some form of sexual assault, abuse or\ninappropriate behavior. Trump's response has been marked by a stunning lack of\ngrace and dignity, let alone contrition or empathy, a response much like the\nman himself. Instead, he is doubling down on sexism. On Thursday, Trump said\nof the People magazine reporter who accused him of forcibly kissing her: \"Look\nat her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.\" He\nsaid on Friday of the woman accusing him of groping her on an airplane:\n\"Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.\" He also\nsaid of Clinton, \"When she walked in front of me, believe me, I wasn't\nimpressed.\" His response to these charges has been surprisingly -- and\nperhaps, revealingly -- callow. He has mocked, whined, chided, bemoaned and\nbelittled. It's as if the man is on a mission to demonstrate to voters the\nstaggering magnitude of his social vulgarity and emotional ineptitude. He has\ndispensed with all semblances of wanting to appear presidential and embraced\nwhat seems to be most natural to him: acting like a pig. Furthermore,\neverything is rigged against him, from the media to the election itself. He's\nthreatening to sue The New York Times. He says he and Clinton should take a\ndrug test before the next debate. These are the ravings of a lunatic. Trump is\nback to carelessly shooting off his mouth and recklessly shooting himself in\nthe foot. It is sad, really, but for him I have no sympathy. He has spent this\nentire election attacking anyone and everyone whom he felt it would be\npolitically advantageous to attack. Trump, now that you're under attack, you\nwant to cry woe-is-me and have people commiserate. Slim chance, big guy. The\ncoarseness of your character has been put on full display, and now the\nelectorate has come to cash the check you wrote. Trump now looks like a madman\nfrom Mad Men, a throwback to when his particular privileges had more perks and\nwere considered less repugnant. He looks pathetic. He is a ball of\ncontradictions that together form a bully, a man who has built a menacing wall\naround the hollow of his self. He is brash to mask his fragility. But in a\nway, Trump was authentically made in America. America has a habit of\nromanticizing the playboy as much as the cowboy, but there is often something\nuntoward about the playboy, unseemly, predatory and broken. For years, Trump\nbuilt a reputation on shuffling through women, treating his exploits with\njocularity and having too much of America smiling in amusement at the bad boy\nantics. But he's not a kid; he's a cad. And he seems constitutionally\nincapable of processing the idea that wealth is not completely immunizing,\nthat some rules are universally applicable, that common decency is required of\nmore than just \"common\" folks. He seems genuinely offended that he should be\nheld to the same standards of truth, decorum and even law as those less well\noff. Trump is in fact the logical extension of toxic masculinity and ambient\nmisogyny. He is the logical extension of rampant racism. He is the logical\nextension of wealth worship. He is the logical extension of pervasive anti-\nintellectualism. Trump is the logical extension of the worst of America. With\nhim you get a man who believes himself superior in every way: through the gift\nof fortune and the happenstance of chromosomes. He believes the rules simply\ndon't apply. Not rules that govern the sovereignty of another's body, not\nrules that dictate decorousness. And the Republican Party was just the right\nplace for him to park himself. When you have a political party that takes as\nits mission to prevent government from working instead of to make government\nwork, a party that conflates the ill effects of a changing economy with the\nchanging complexion of the country and is still struck by fever over the\nelection of President Obama, Trump is a natural, predictable endpoint.\nFurthermore, Trump is what happens when you wear your Christian conservative\nvalues like a cardigan to conveniently slip off when the heat rises. Trump is\nfundamentally altering American politics -- coarsening them, corrupting them,\ncratering them. And America, particularly conservative America, has only\nitself to blame. Republicans sowed intolerance and in its shadow, Trump sprang\nup like toxic fungi.\n\n",

By Stephen Owsinski; OpsLens: Ever wake up\nand go on about your day as you please, without complying with laws or having\nto pay your fair share of taxes? Although a tax-free life is enticing, I\nfirmly adhere to my patriotic duty as an American citizen investing in the\nUnited States by paying taxes. However, \"sovereign citizens\" do not feel that\nway and opt to make up their own rules which, basically, refrain from playing\nby the rules whatsoever. A man in Washington County, Oregon did just that. He\nignored our laws and thought he'd be Scot-free of responsibility…until a\ndeputy sheriff got behind his pickup truck and saw his license plate. It read\n\"No driver license or insurance required.\" You know how license plates have\nunique characters identifying the vehicle/owner, like ABC-123? Well this\nsovereign citizen's vehicle license was to the point, displaying the special\ncharacters \"PRIVATE\" below which were the words \"Not for Commerce Use -\nPrivate Mode of Travel.\" Craftily, the license plate also had a logo depicting\nour shared planet, encircled by the words \"Peace on Earth…Good Will Towards\nMen.\" No color scheme was used, only a black-on-white graphic design. Frankly,\nbecause it was so well designed, I am led to believe it was mass-produced for\nother sovereign citizens to tool around in their cars or trucks, doing as they\nplease. Entitlements come in all shapes and forms; just ask any cop about the\nbizarre culture they encounter on the streets. For his role, Richard Leroy\nGarrison, 63, was arrested and charged with failure to carry and present a\nvalid license and interfering with a peace officer. His vehicle bearing a fake\nlicense plate was impounded by Washington County cops. Why impounded? Since\nGarrison's vehicle was involved in the commission of a crime, law enforcement\nauthorities reserve the right to tow said mode of transportation. Besides,\nevery state's motor vehicle laws require that only properly registered cars be\npermitted to drive upon its public thoroughfares. Invalid license plates\nequates to an immobilized car, so towing is the remedy. It is customary\nprotocol throughout the United States as it pertains to motor vehicle statutes\nand compliance with same. Like pay-to-play, only legitimate. Motor vehicle\nregistration fees, surcharges and taxes fund the actual public roads motorists\ndrive upon. So, a so-called sovereign citizen like Mr. Garrison is traversing\nroadways we paid for, exempting himself from highway maintenance. In his mind,\nit's that simple. This is not the first time a self-professed sovereign\ncitizen motoring down a tax-payer funder public roadway was stopped by police\nand arrested for his/her vehicle's attached license plate. I'm not referring\nto a state-issued, legally sanctioned license plate with a minor expiration\ndate violation. In most cases, that is a civil infraction resulting in nothing\nmore than a ticket or warning to get it updated. I am referring to an\nartificial DIY license plate clandestinely manufactured by anti-government\ngroups whose membership believes it does not have to comply with our nation's\nlaws. These folks are not only anti-police--although it is law enforcement\nofficers who get to engage their subversive tendencies--they are opposed to\nall-things-government. Self-proclaimed sovereign citizens go about their lives\nfully relinquishing the responsibility of social norms practiced and funded by\nlaw-abiding citizens. Adhering to all federal, state and local laws is not\ntheir cup of tea. Therefore, the [Tea Party](https://www.teaparty.org/) -whose\n\"mission is to bring awareness to any issue which challenges the security,\nsovereignty, or domestic tranquility of our beloved nation, the United States\nof America\"- is definitely not in the cards for this bunch. So what exactly is\na sovereign citizen and what are the philosophies, objectives, and membership\nall about? According to the FBI, sovereign citizens can be violent extremists.\nThe FBI defines \"sovereign citizens\" as \" [domestic\nterrorism](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2010/april/sovereigncitizens_041310)\"\nmade of members who are deemed \"anti-government extremists who believe that\neven though they physically reside in this country, they are separate or\n'sovereign' from the United States. As a result, they believe they don't have\nto answer to any government authority, including courts, taxing entities,\nmotor vehicle departments, or law enforcement.\" The perils are palpable. Our\nnation has experienced instances whereby some proclaiming sovereign\ncitizenship had no pause before going up against and horrifically murdering\npolice officials, exacting full-on gun battles. The FBI reports that sovereign\ncitizens are a \" [growing domestic threat to law\nenforcement](https://leb.fbi.gov/2011/september/sovereign-citizens-a-growing-\ndomestic-threat-to-law-enforcement),\" capable of violence and government\nsubversion. At its core, sovereign citizenship holds jurisdictional\nindifference and believes the US operates without care or concern for its\ncitizens. Hence, they go it alone, albeit illegally. Sovereign citizens can\npoke holes in our national security defenses as well as our country's\nstability. Be not fooled by statistics and verbiage claiming sovereign\ncitizens are a loosely-knit group informally conducting their lives without\nany recognized leadership. In fact, federal intelligence agencies do not bill\nthem as neither an anarchist group nor a militia, \"although they sometimes buy\nand use illegal weapons.\" However informal they may be as a demographic, their\nbelief system fuels the dangers they present. Spontaneous outbursts when\nstopped by police have culminated in volleys of bullets. [Police\ntraining](https://www.policeone.com/investigations/articles/6176998-10-tips-\nand-tactics-for-investigating-Sovereign-Citizens/) now includes how to deal\nwith sovereign citizens, and law enforcement [trainers indoctrinate street\ncops](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2012/09/sovereign-\ncitizens-a-clear-and-present-danger.aspx) in optimal ways to handle these\nparticular encounters. FBI reports indicate these folks are engaged in and\nfinance themselves with white collar crimes such as mortgage fraud,\ncounterfeit currency and money orders, credit fraud, identity theft, and false\ntax filings. Just as it is often said \"Driving is a privilege, not a right\"\naccorded by law, the allowance is never free. And that is the pulse of\n\"sovereign citizen\" philosophy, that they do as they please without abiding by\ngovernment…to include (exclude) paying a fair share otherwise known as taxes.\nGiven Mr. Garrison's age, I presume he listened to Frank Sinatra croon \"I Did\nIt My Way.\" He may also have had the experience of listening to lyrics such as\n\"I Fought the Law and the Law Won.\" I bet getting his vehicle out of police\nimpound will be an interesting feat for Mr. Garrison and others embracing the\nsovereign citizen belief system. Must be legal to roll on down the road, no\nifs, ands or buts. Back to square one: \"May I see your registration, please?\"\n\n",

He\nmade no secret of who he would take our country back from: minorities, women,\nimmigrants, Muslims, Jews. And despite his open disdain for the rule of law,\nhe often justified his mission by invoking the language the reactionary right\nhas long used to describe their quest to turn back time: \"restoring the\nConstitution.\" It is imperative that we stop letting the right own the\nConstitution. Given that we're about to have a president with dictatorial\naspirations, and both houses of Congress controlled by the Republican Party\nfrom which he sprang, the public needs more than ever to understand and demand\nour constitutional protections. We must be a meaningful check on how much\ndamage these people can do. But for that to happen, liberals are going to have\nto stop letting the right's claims to constitutional authority for their\npreferred social order go unanswered. Too often, liberals and progressives\ntreat the Constitution as an obsolete document written by white men who\nenslaved black people and treated women as property that has little relevance\nto our modern battles. In doing so, we've ceded the ground to white men\nlonging for the good ol' days.  Michael Cohen, Lanny Davis and the Russian\nMafia Yes, the Constitution was written by white guys who got a lot very\nwrong, and it would indeed be a bankrupt document if it were frozen in time.\nBut while the Founders lacked the empathy or courage to recognize that \"We the\nPeople\" includes people of all colors, religions and genders, they enshrined\nrevolutionary principles of what liberty entails and left room for us to\ninterpret and amend the document to be more in keeping with those principles.\nLiberals must articulate a vision of the Constitution, because what Americans\nunderstand the Constitution to say [acts as a\nconstraint](http://msmagazine.com/blog/2016/03/02/abortion-is-a-\nconstitutional-right-we-need-to-stop-talking-like-it-isnt/) on what\npoliticians and courts can do. Historically, we've made major strides by\ngetting our fellow citizens to accept evolved interpretations of the\nConstitution's text - for example, by arguing that segregation violates the\nright to equal protection of the law, and that forcing a person to carry a\npregnancy to term against her will violates her 14th Amendment right to\nliberty. The shocking election of Donald Trump tells us we haven't made nearly\nas much progress as we thought toward convincing our fellow citizens that all\npeople are created equal and protected by the Constitution. It's a moment to\nremember that in the not-so-distant past a suffragette demanding the full\nrights of citizenship could be [imprisoned and force-\nfed](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/07/17/sylvia_pankhurst_the_suffragette_s_first_person_account_of_force_feeding.html),\nand even more recently black people doing the same were [beaten and\nlynched](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/till/peopleevents/e_lynch.html). In\nhindsight, it was somewhat naive to think the country had changed so much and\nso quickly that it would resoundingly reject Trump's misogyny, racism and\nxenophobia. Right now, in the days and weeks and months after Trump's upset\nvictory, we must articulate a vision of the Constitution to combat the idea\nthat our changed country is a deviation from it. It is deeply unsettling to a\nlarge segment of Americans that they can suffer in economic malaise while a\nblack man occupies the highest office, as the country becomes less white and\nChristian, and as women assume new roles. We need to be clear that there is no\ngoing back to when things were \"great\" just for white men - the changes we've\nseen are the inevitable result of moving closer to the equality the\nConstitution requires. We're here, we're queer, we're female, we're black,\nwe're brown, we're Jewish and we're Muslim. As dire as things feel today,\nTrump, his supporters and the Republicans who bred them will eventually have\nto get used to it. We must explain to change-resistant white people that an\naltered country is the inevitable result of adhering to the founding document\nthey claim to revere. But the more concrete and immediate reason we have to\nstart talking about the Constitution is that many of the things Trump wants to\ndo are not only terrible policy, but flagrantly unconstitutional. We just\nelected a man who has proposed torturing people, making religious\ndiscrimination official policy, banning abortion and \"loosening up\" the First\nAmendment, along with a Congress full of Republicans who have proven incapable\nof standing up to him.

            "input": "This past weekend, Americans watched in shock as \"alt-right\" members, neo-\nNazis and white nationalists descended upon Charlottesville, Virginia,\nattempting to spread their message of hate and intolerance. Clashes between\nwhite nationalists and counter-protesters were numerous. One counter-\nprotester, Heather Heyer, was killed when a man rammed his car into several\ncounter-protesters. The man, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., was later\ncharged with second-degree murder. Earlier that day, he was photographed\ndisplaying the symbols of a white nationalist group called Vanguard America,\nwhich later denied he was a member. That weekend journalist Shaun King [posted\na video](https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/897311005419728897) of several\nmen beating a 20-year-old man named Deandre Harris. King, who was attempting\nto confirm the identities of the men behind the beating, found that one of the\nmen, Alex Michael Ramos, identifies as Latino. A group called the [Atlanta\nAntifascists then\ntweeted](https://twitter.com/afainatl/status/897312316424835073) that Ramos\nwas affiliated with the Atlanta chapter of the far-right organization Proud\nBoys and the far-right militia called the Georgia Security Force. In a\n[Facebook live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvBXKX-Q8K8) that has\nsince been deleted, Ramos claimed he wasn't racist because he was Puerto\nRican.  When a viewer asked why he marched with racists, Ramos said, \"I stood\nby racist people but they weren't racist to me.\" Ramos' assertion that his\nPuerto Rican roots meant he couldn't be racist is a prime example of Latinos\nwho are completely ignorant of their ability to perpetuate white supremacy.\nGuess what? Latinos, both here and in Latin America, do and say plenty of\nthings that promote anti-blackness -- and most of the time we don't even blink\nan eye when it happens. When it comes to discussing racism, we often subscribe\nto the black vs. white binary that we often see in the United States. If our\nviews aren't extreme, if we're not a \"full-blown racist,\" then we're\ncompletely absolved of perpetuating anti-blackness, right? Wrong. When we\nthink like that, we tend to ignore the colorism -- often subtle -- that\npermeates through much of Latin America. It's a difficult thing to confront,\nbut if we don't address it within our own community, we can't expect it to\nmagically resolve itself. Pulitzer prize-winning Dominican-American author\nJunot Diaz [once said](http://bookhaven.stanford.edu/2012/06/junot-diaz-on-\noscar-waos-yunior-and-the-word-that-could-have-saved-him/), \"White supremacy's\ngreatest trick is that it has convinced people that it exists always in other\npeople, never in us.\" Don't believe him? Earlier this year, Carlos Hakas, the\nman who angrily knocked over an elotero's cart in Los Angeles, exclaimed, \"I'm\nnot racist, I'm from Argentina!\" In 2015, Univision entertainment reporter\nRodner Figueroa compared Michelle Obama to a cast member of \"Planet of The\nApes.\" When he was fired over the comments, Figueroa wrote an [open\nletter](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/12/rodner-figueroa-carta-\nmichelle-obama-disculpas_n_6857160.html) to Michelle Obama saying he isn't\nracist because he comes from a bi-racial family. What about last year, when\nBlack Lives Matter was marching in the streets and you heard someone (maybe it\nwas you) say, \"Latinos need to fight for our causes, like immigration reform,\"\ncompletely ignoring the fact that there are black Latinos?  It doesn't just\nhappen in the U.S. The idea that anti-blackness is only a thing perpetuated by\n\"white Americans\" is what leads a Mexican sports newspaper to make jokes like\nthis one, literally days after a person died in Charlottesville: Meanwhile, in\nMexican print media… ??

            "input": "Steve Bannon is on the warpath, continuing his mission to drain the swamp.\nThis is hardly a new revelation. Long before President Trump was a glint in\nthe Tea Party's eye, the Breitbart News chairman was hard at work laying the\nfoundation to what would be a dominating force in Republican politics at the\nintersection of Conservatism, Libertarianism and Populism - promoting the\nlikes of Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to national prominence. The\nformer Chief White House Strategist is [fresh off\nstumping](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/26/live-updates-\njudge-roy-moores-grassroots-muscle-vs-luther-stranges-corporate-money-alabama-\ngop-senate-runoff/) for firebrand jurist Roy Moore, who claimed a decisive\nvictory against Sen. Luther Strange - a swamp varmint appointed under dubious\ncircumstances to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' vacated Alabama Senate\nseat. Bannon's influence in the Alabama blowout has many wondering what's next\nfor the populist rabble-rouser. CNN's Dana Bash reports the political\ntactician is setting his sights on the 2018 midterms, crisscrossing the\ncountry in search of populist candidates to remake the Republican Party, and\nblackballing swamp creatures who refuse to be drained. From\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/politics/steve-bannon-retribution-\nrecruiting/index.html): \"The populist movement is going to do a house cleaning\nof all those individuals that made a living off the conservative grassroots\nwhile stabbing them in the back,\" a source familiar with Bannon's thinking\ntells CNN. Bannon is beginning that effort by trying to blackball GOP campaign\nstrategist Jeff Roe, who worked for Sen. Luther Strange, who lost Tuesday's\nprimary to Roy Moore. Bannon is spreading the word that he believes Roe is\nresponsible for dirty tactics against Moore, and alleging that Roe worked with\nPresident Donald Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner to\nmislead Trump about the state of the race in Alabama in and around Trump's\nendorsement of Strange. […] Following his speech at Moore's victory rally\nTuesday night where Bannon credited \"the people\" with the victory, he vowed to\nhelp the populist wing of the GOP win other Senate battles in 2018. To that\nend, he flew from Alabama to Colorado to begin recruiting western candidates\nto run against Republican incumbents…. Bannon also plans to head back down\nsouth to have meetings with those who may want to run in Tennessee for the\nseat Sen. Bob Corker announced he will vacate, and in Mississippi, to\nchallenge sitting Republican Sen. Roger Wicker. Bannon's rage against crony\ncapitalism has already electrified the base, striking fear in the hearts of\nthe ivory tower establishment who have enriched themselves on the backs of\naverage Americans. As a former Goldman Sachs banker who grew disillusioned\nwith their strong-arm tactics, Bannon witnessed the decimation of the working\nmiddle class, as Wall St. firms facilitated the largest betrayal of Americans\nin history while creating a looming debt bubble which could still lead to\nsystemic collapse. Bannon's unique purview of high-level greed is potent, and\nhis disgust towards establishment is fueled in large part by the incestuous\nrevolving door between DC and Wall Street. Bannon [witnessed first\nhand](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/) how\nGoldman Sachs, once a monastery to the ambitious investment banker, became The\nBlack House. As President Trump and Steve Bannon, two of the Right's most\ninfluential figures today continue to remake the Republican Party, an\nimportant question arises; In whose image will the future of the Conservative\nmovement be cast? At first glance, Trumpism and Bannonism bear many\nsimilarities. Rooted in right-wing populism and traditionalism alike, both\nideologies seek to shift the center of power from Corporate America back to\nthe American worker. Both men believe the elite have benefited\ndisproportionately from globalization, while hallowing out a once prosperous\nmiddle class in the process. And both Trump and Bannon have furiously railed\nagainst a swamp that has profited handsomely from endless spillage of blood\nand treasure abroad, while cities at home suffer from racial and economic\ntensions stoked by the Obama administration. In short, both Trump and Bannon\nsee that the world is suffering from systemic division orchestrated at the\nhighest levels, and Western cultures are actively being destroyed under the\nfalse pretense of humanitarianism and open-border politics. Finally, in order\nto preserve America's borders, language and culture, both men believe an\nimpenetrable wall must be built to prevent illegal aliens from breaching the\nnation's geography. That's where the similarities between Trumpism and\nBannonism end. A key difference, if not the difference between Trump and his\nformer chief strategist, is the President's penchant for compromise and\ndealmaking, while Bannon is far less malleable in his beliefs. Where Trumpism\nfails the ideological purity test - which risks alienating his base, Bannonism\nis brimming with the very civic nationalism that led to Trump's win. Herein\nlies the rub for Trump voters - the commander-in-chief has demonstrated a very\n'swamp-like' flexibility on matters ranging from healthcare to immigration,\nleaving Trump's most oft-repeated campaign promises on the cutting room floor.\nIn September, for example, President Trump shocked Washington by announcing a\ntentative framework to work with Democratic leadership on DACA and the looming\nbudget crisis. [Washington\nTimes](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/6/donald-trump-agrees-\ndebt-limit-deal/) reports: President\n[Trump](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/) and Democratic\nleaders on Wednesday did what\n[Washington](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/) does best:\nstriking a bipartisan deal to boost borrowing and spending, keeping the\ngovernment running into the next fiscal year and speeding disaster relief to\nTexas and Florida. [Mr. Trump](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-\ntrump/) accepted the deal offered by [House\nMinority](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/house-minority/) Leader Nancy\nPelosi and [Senate](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/) Minority\nLeader Charles E. Schumer at a [White\nHouse](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/) meeting, seeing it\nas a chance to get ahead of a series of pressing fiscal problems that needed\nto be fixed this month. But the agreement blindsided Republican leaders,\nincluding House Speaker [Paul D.\nRyan](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-d-ryan/), who just hours\nearlier called Democrats' proposal \"ridiculous and disgraceful.\" For some\nreason, however, Trump's most vocal opponents on the right didn't seem to be\ncaught off guard by his \"deal,\" with a smirking Chuck Schumer and Nancy\nPelosi, as 'Never-Trumpers' have long warned that the President was nothing\nmore than a chameleon who couldn't be trusted to prosecute the Republican\nagenda. According to Schumer, President Trump even suggested against building\nthe border wall between the U.S. and Mexico - a move which would be seen by\nTrump's loyal base as the ultimate betrayal. [Breitbart\nNews](http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/09/29/chuck-schumer-negotiations-\ntrump-said-ok-wont-wall/) reports: This week on the \"Pod Save America\"\npodcast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) detailed the debt ceiling\nand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy negotiations he had\nwith House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and President Donald Trump\nearlier in the month. Schumer said, \"On DREAMers, he said, you know, that he\nunderstood that they didn't come in through any fault of their own, that\nthey're good Americans, good kids. And then he said he wants the wall in\nreturn. And we said 'No. No wall, Mr. President.' And he tried that for about\n15 minutes, but he's not going to push me around verbally or any other way.\"\nHe added, \"And he finally said, \"OK, we won't do the wall. We'll do some other\nkind of border security.\" Was such an offer ever made by Trump? One may never\nknow, and thus exists the problem. Under Bannon's more hard-line economic\nnationalism, claims of Trump wavering would have been branded as nothing more\nthan propaganda from the left. Instead, an increasingly malleable Trump is\ndisappointing even his most ardent supporters. Bannon's endgame Steve Bannon's\nrefusal to bend the knee to deep-state establishmentarians would betray his\nmission; elect enough Populist Conservatives to Congress to successfully\nimplement the MAGA agenda in earnest - reshaping the country to such a degree\nthat even if a Democrat manages to win the presidency, Populism and Economic\nNationalism continue to dominate the political spectrum - restoring faith in\ngovernment among the abandoned middle class. Bannonism, by its very nature,\nviews compromise with the establishment as a last resort. This approach\nappeals to Trump's base, who went to the polling booths to actively resist\nthreats to National Security, the economy, and the American way of life. Alas,\nit's clear that the desires of American conservatives have fallen on tone-deaf\nears. One need look no further than the Alabama Senate race - which saw Trump\nflagrantly abandon his base by supporting deep-state candidate Luther Strange\nover Bannon-supported economic nationalist Roy Moore. And instead of rallying\nbehind the MAGA candidate, traditionally pro-establishment conservative\noutlets were more concerned with optics than substance. National Review's\nReihan Salam, for example, [seemed to be disproportionately\nconcerned](http://www.nationalreview.com/media/need-know/need-know-men-white-\ncoats-0) that Moore would provide CNN with endless soundbytes and fodder.\n\"When I look at Roy Moore, I see someone who is clearly apocalyptic, and I\ndon't see anything else to him, and I think that it's bad news for the GOP.\nIt's great, great news for CNN, the Washington Post and every big mainstream\nnews media outlet that will cover every single one of his utterances,\"\ncomplained Salam in the latest edition of The Editors, a podcast led by\nNational Review's Charles C.W. Cooke and Rich Lowry. The concern is embryonic\nof the neurosis plaguing the establishment (and like it or not, a powerful\nsubset of the Conservative movement). They actually care what the talking\nheads on CNN think. Meanwhile, every-day American conservatives have stopped\ntrusting the Very Fake News network. Perhaps it's high time Republican elites\nfollow suit. Sponsored Sponsored\n\n",

Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian\ngovernment and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian\ngovernment, only herself. She also said she \"couldn't have had\" information on\nHillary Clinton. \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the\nsummer,\" Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges\nthe younger Trump posted to Twitter. The emails, dated early June, show\nGoldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based\ndeveloper Aras Agalarov, had \"helped along\" the Russian government's support\nfor Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss\nUniverse pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about\nbuilding a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a\nmusic video with the younger Agalarov. Goldstone at one point said he could\nsend the information to Trump's father first directly \"via Rhona,\" an apparent\nreference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff. The email\nrelease followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of\nthe meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after\nthey were obtained by The New York Times. On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the\nencounter as being a \"short introductory meeting\" focused on the disbanded\nprogram that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended\nthe adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to\nalleged human rights violations in Russia. A day later, Trump Jr. changed his\naccount, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might\nhave information \"helpful\" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during\nthe meeting that she had something about Clinton. In his third description of\nwhat occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he\nwould hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that\nhe first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was\ntold that the attorney would be in New York \"and I decided to take the\nmeeting.\" \"The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government\nofficial,\" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. \"And, as we have said, she\nhad no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the\nMagnitsky Act.\" The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump\nJr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain.

I know that November 8th is\nonly the beginning of our miseries, because one of the most depressing things\nabout this election season--which has already put America on the brink of\nsuicide--is the fact that it isn't gonna end on Election Day. We know Trump\nwill lose, and we also now know that Trump and his acolytes have NO plans to\nlose graciously. Trump isn't gonna concede, and he isn't gonna go away, not\nwhen he's already achieved the wet dream of seeing his every word move\nmountains. He will do his best to undermine the election results, and stoke\nviolence, and gin up perpetual outrage against the media, and he will appear\non your television screen every hour on the hour--summoned like a fucking\ngenie--to rail against the legitimacy of a Hillary Clinton presidency. And\nhe'll have the unofficial support of his estranged party when he does.

It's been discouraging to watch the GOP stymie\nObama at every turn for the last eight years (with Obama, at times, being far\ntoo deferential to them), and it's not like they're gonna magically grow a\nheart once Hillary Clinton takes office. I promise you that dipshits like\nMitch McConnell will declare it their mission to thwart Clinton, and then sit\non their dicks for the duration of her stay in the White House. That's how the\nGOP works. They deserve to go down with Trump and yet, somehow, they'll\nsurvive all this, without being forced to learn a thing. Even if they lose\ncontrol of Congress, they'll find a way to regenerate and then fuck everyone.\nEverything Trump does in practice, they do in policy. And they'll have the\nsupport of both their donors AND the pig voters they have nurtured for years\n(who have been granted more anthropological empathy than virtually any other\nsegment of society), the ones who flocked to Trump this year but will gladly\nstick by the Republican party because they've been conditioned for the past\nthree decades to cry out \"BITCH!\" any time anyone says the name Hillary out\nloud.

This is how a boob like Paul\nRyan--he's so emotionally torn here, you guys!--somehow engenders more\nsympathy from certain people than Trump's victims do. No one ever gets written\noff for good the way they ought to be. During the second debate, Trump [lied\nnearly every minute](https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/785449458720993280),\nthreatened to jail his opponent, defended talking about grabbing women by the\npussy by saying it was locker room talk, humped his chair, invited Bill\nClinton's accusers to the debate and planned to have them angrily confront him\non camera, frequently pointed at Hillary Clinton like he wanted to stab her\nwith his Tiny Tim finger, admitted once more to not paying his taxes, and\ngenerally made the whole world uncomfortable. And yet there was Matthews\nafterward, crowing, \"This one had a far less clear outcome!\" He really said\nthat. Christ. I haven't even gotten to the alt-right sites yet… sites that\nwould likely benefit more from Trump losing than from him winning. Alex Jones\nwill get to rip his shirt off nightly, to the delight of both the uneducated\nand Irony Twitter.

Debunking them is a full-time job. They won't vanish in a single\nnight. Pepe the Frog isn't going away. The second Trump loses, he's gonna\nappear on your Facebook Uncle's shoulder and whisper \"BURN IT ALL.\" We will\nnever be free of this election, not when there's profit to be had from it,\nboth financially and ideologically. The madness of 2016 will bleed into 2020,\nand then into 2024, and on and on with no rest. I hate admitting this. I\ngenuinely believe that people are good, for the most part. But I've seen too\nmuch now. In a sane universe, the number of Trump supporters is zero. The fact\nthat he has any support at all--much less from millions of people--suggests a\nbrokenness in America that will take a long, long time to fix, if it ever gets\nfixed at all.

            "input": "How many disasters must Puerto Rico suffer? After Hurricane Maria tore through\nthe Puerto Rico, President Donald Trump was extremely slow to acknowledge that\nthe U.S. territory was in dire need of aid. When Trump finally decided it was\ntime to visit these Americans in need, his trip was a disaster in itself. Here\nare some of the shockingly insensitive, incompetent and tone-deaf things Trump\nsaid during his trip to Puerto Rico: 1. Endless Self-Promotion Despite\ncriticism from Puerto Rican leaders and the fact that only 32 percent of\nAmericans approve of how he's handled the disaster, Trump has spent much of\nhis time on the island insisting that everything has been going terrifically!\n\"I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done,\" [he\nsaid](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/president-trump-just-set-a-new-standard-\nin-his-search-for-flattery-this-time-in-hurricane-ravaged-puerto-rico.html).\n\"In Texas and in Florida, we get an A+, and I'll tell you what: I think we've\ndone just as good in Puerto Rico.\" \"We only heard thank yous from the people\nof Puerto Rico,\" [he told another reporter](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-\nsays-visit-hurricane-ravaged-puerto-rico-was-really-lovely-and-he-\nonly-677122). Here's an idea: rather than telling people what a great job he's\ndone, Trump should actually just do a great job, and then the people of Puerto\nRico will do the complimenting for him. 2. Depicting Puerto Ricans As Lazy\nTrump played upon an old, terrible stereotype of Latino laziness when he\nalleged that Puerto Ricans \" [want everything to be done for\nthem](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-everything-done-\nfor-them-mar-a-lago_us_59d031c0e4b05f005d34a6dd).\" According to Trump in the\nsame tweet, the leadership of Puerto Rico was ineffective and they couldn't\nmanage to get their own people to participate in the relief work. This comment\nis as dog whistle-y as racist dog whistles get, which is why it's entirely\nfair that internet commenters started sharing this photo en masse to remind\nTrump who exactly likes to have everything to be done for him: [ 3\\. Trump Is\n\"In the Dark\" About What's Happening While handing out flashlights to\nhurricane survivors, Trump couldn't help but comment on the supposed\npointlessness of the exercise. \"Flashlights?\"\n](http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/uploads/2017/10/DK_L1dAUMAA7EcH1.jpg)[he\nsaid aloud](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/1703847 ). \"You don't need 'em\nanymore. You don't need 'em.\" Why Trump felt the need to say that is unclear,\nespecially since at that point 95 percent of Puerto Rico was still without\nelectricity. Maybe Trump was being taken to places with power, but the vast\nmajority of Puerto Ricans could really use those flashlights to, you know, see\nat night. 4. \"Playfully\" Tossing Supplies At least he wasn't physically\nthrowing the flashlights at the people of Puerto Rico. During another moment,\nTrump began [tossing paper towel rolls](http://www.newsweek.com/san-juan-\nmayor-slams-trump-throwing-paper-towels-terrible-abominable-677369) one at a\ntime to the crowd. [ It's not only an inefficient manner of distributing\nsupplies to people in need of resources, it's a pretty degrading one. As much\nas Trump may fancy himself some sort of rock star, these aren't fans attending\na concert looking for free merchandise. Technically, Trump didn't say anything\nin this instance, but the disrespect spoke volumes in his actions alone. 5.\nMaking Puerto Rico Feel Like an Imposition The nerve of Puerto Rico to have a\nhurricane - don't they know how expensive recovery efforts are? Trump made\nsure they were well aware at a press briefing on the island. \"I hate to tell\nyou, Puerto Rico, but you threw our budget a little out of whack,\"\n](http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/uploads/2017/10/giphy.gif)[he\nsaid](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/trump-puerto-rico-budget.html). Hahaha,\nwhat a funny joke, right? The president didn't make residents of Texas or\nFlorida feel like they were a waste of money, so it seems extra suspect for\nthe president to say something like this after already treating Puerto Ricans\nas lesser American citizens. 6. Minimizing the Scale of the Disaster In the\nface of his initial inaction, Trump has repeatedly tried to downplay the scale\nof Hurricane Maria. While speaking to Puerto Rican officials [he\nsaid](https://www.vox.com/2017/10/3/16411488/trump-remarks-puerto-rico), \"If\nyou look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous\nhundreds and hundreds of people that died…\" Trump said. Sorry, there's no need\nto finish that sentence, did Trump just really suggest a place experiencing\nmassive devastation was not a \"real catastrophe\"? It's true that the death\ncount in Puerto Rico is significantly lower than that of Hurricane Katrina,\nbut if that's enough to make Trump \"proud\" (his own words) of how he's handled\nthis crisis, he's completely off base. 7. Wiping Out Debt - But Not Really In\nan interview on Tuesday, Trump told Fox News that to help Puerto Rico, [he was\ngoing to](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/04/puerto-rico-debt-trump-\nmick-mulvaney-response-243440) \"wipe out\" their existing debt. \"You can wave\ngoodbye to that,\" he said. Honestly, it was one of the most productive ideas\nto come out of the Trump administration throughout the disaster… too bad it\nseems that Trump was babbling without having consulted with his staff who are\nnot on board with this idea. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick\nMulvaney backtracked on the president's comments saying, \"I wouldn't take it\nword for word with that,\" insisting that the White House would instead focus\non providing disaster relief. Way to get Puerto Rico's hopes up!\n\n",

            "input": "During the 1950s \"Red Scare,\" innocent Americans were smeared and sometimes\nblacklisted for being supposed Communists. Real subversives existed, including\nAlger Hiss, a traitor and Soviet spy whom liberals - to their misfortune -\nmade into a poster boy of McCarthyism. But the actual number of Communists was\ntiny and utterly not commensurate with the fervent public witch hunt led by\nright-wingers. Today's group hysteria comes from the left, as a fanatic\npolitical mob sees racists behind every door. Their paranoia is not harmless,\nas they use the racist bogeyman to intimidate political adversaries - and\nsometimes erstwhile friends - while seeking to silence political dialogue. As\nwith the Red Scare, there's some reason for vigilance regarding actual\nracists, as Charlottesville reminded us. But as with the hunt for Communists\nunder every bed, the scare tactics far outweigh the actual problem. The New\nMcCarthyism revealed its full absurdity this week via the ACLU's Twitter\nstream, which had the temerity to post a picture of an adorable young toddler\nholding an American flag and a doll with the tag line \"This is the future that\nACLU members want.\" Because the girl (TRIGGER WARNING: I assume it's a girl,\ngiven the doll) happens to be blonde and Caucasian, the ACLU was promptly\nattacked - the ACLU! Immediately the politically correct rage mob commenced a\ndigital protest led by credentialed injustice professionals such as Professor\nNyasha Junior of Temple University who posted, \"A white kid with a flag?!\"\nYes, Professor. In much of America outside of your faculty lounge, young\nAmerican children waving Old Glory warms the heart and makes us smile rather\nthan prompt thoughts of white supremacy lurking under the sheets. Did the\nACLU, a group once known for taking brave and unpopular stands, hold its\nground or, better yet, simply ignore the online rabble? Sadly, no. The\norganization shortly responded with a Kermit the Frog image saying \"That's a\nvery good point\" and the post \"When your followers keep you in check and\nremind you that white supremacy is everywhere.\" Come again? This lovely young\nkid holding a flag equals \"white supremacy\"? Who even thinks of such things?\nAnswer: the diversity hustlers. Shame on the ACLU, which apparently should\nhave posted a picture of a gender-fluid dark-skinned child, holding a rainbow\nflag, perhaps with a COEXIST sticker on [gender-neutral pronoun] wheelchair.\nThis is not merely social-media silliness. It's not even lunacy, although it\ncertainly seems insane. This is a weapon used cynically and viciously --\nlittle girls are apparently acceptable collateral damage -- by the left to\nisolate and demonize opponents, and particularly President Trump and his\nsupporters. As MSNBC's Donny Deutsch said of Trump: \"He is a racist -- can we\njust say it once and for all?\" Such accusations are not rare. If I had a\ndollar for every time the mainstream media accused Trump and his voters of\nracism, I'd be about as rich as the recent Powerball winner. As a Hispanic, I\nbelieve that people of color, for far too long, have been taken for granted by\nthe Democratic Party. I also believe that the Trump movement represents real\npolicy solutions for the woes of poverty and violence that burden too many\nAfrican-American and Latino citizens. But the digital rage mob holds people\nlike me in particular contempt, as I saw during the 2016 campaign in the form\nof a constant stream of online slurs. Yes, today's liberals are quick to use\nracism's terms when it suits their purposes, calling me a \"coconut\" (brown on\nthe outside, white on the inside) and \"Tio Tomas\" (Uncle Tom in Spanish). One\nof the main reasons America has succeeded as a country lies is our rejection\nof the tribalism that afflicts and paralyzes so much of the world. America is\nan idea, and one open to all who embrace it, regardless of skin color,\nheritage, or religion. To be sure, America must own the racist sins of our\nhistory. Thankfully, such systemic racism is just that, history - as evidenced\nby electing twice to our highest office an African-American man with a\ndecidedly un-European name. Instead of allowing a new scourge, this Racist\nScare, to corrode our discourse, we must embrace our common American identity,\nrooted in our best traditions and elucidated in our founding documents. We\nshould be difficult to offend and slow to accuse others of the disease of\nprejudice. As the incumbent president of the United States explained in his\ninaugural address seven months ago: \"When you open your heart to patriotism,\nthere is no room for bigotry.\" Amen.

            "input": "[ I was listening to a Christian radio show awhile back before I was scheduled\nto go on, and one of the guests before me was talking about the organization\nhe formed to fight back against powerful liberals in the United States and the\nideologies they are spending billions of dollars to advance. This man kept\ntalking about how liberalism is a \"threat\" to Christianity, and how any number\nof liberal political ideologies are going to somehow damage the faith, though\nhe wasn't very specific as to how. Similarly, I was watching a video the other\nday in which the Christian missionary called Islam \"the greatest threat to\nChristianity today.\" Really? A threat to what? Make Christianity untrue? What\nAre We So Afraid Of? So many American Christians, evangelicals in particular,\nare paralyzed by ](https://churchleaders-\neszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/10/10.11.CC.HOME_.AThreatToChristians.jpg)fear. We talk\nabout how political liberalism or Islam are \"threats\" to Christianity and make\ncompelling cases for why our brothers and sisters in Christ should devote\ntime, money and other resources to protect Christianity against these threats.\nChristianity is not threatened by modern political liberalism, any strand of\nIslam (violent or non-violent) or any other worldview on the entire planet. I\ntweeted last week: \"If you view other religions or worldviews as 'threats' to\nChristianity, I kind of wonder if you know how the story ends.\" The idea that\nsomething could be a \"threat\" to Christianity implies that, somehow,\nChristianity could be put on a sort of \"endangered religions\" list, or that\nChristians could become extinct altogether. This is a lie fueled by hearts\nthat have made an idol of power and influence. Christianity, defined by the\ngospel of Jesus Christ and the implications of that gospel, offers the world\nwhat other worldviews cannot. So, Christians who want the best for their\ncommunities and the world are right to work for Christianity's spread around\nthe world. But, particularly among conservative evangelicals in 21st-century\nAmerica, there seems to be a feeling that Christianity is at risk of\nextinction. This is not the case. Christianity's Dominance Is Threatened Is\nChristianity at risk of losing its powerful influence over America? Yes it is\n(most say it already has). Is Christianity at risk of becoming less and less\nsocially acceptable in America and bordering on being considered \"hate\"? Yes\nit is. For some, these two truths are terrifying and are indicative of the\nimpending demise of Christianity. Do not believe this lie. It is right to be\nconcerned for the millions of Christians around the world who are being\nthreatened. This is a reality about which we should be praying regularly. But\n\"threatened Christians\" do not make a \"threatened Christianity.\"\nChristianity's existence and well-being is not dependent on how widespread it\nis accepted in America or the world. Christianity is dependent on the finished\nwork of Christ. Period. This means nothing is a \"threat\" to Christianity.\nPlenty of forces--worldviews, political ideologies and more--threaten\nChristianity's dominance in America. For some, Christianity's dominance in\nAmerica and the Western world is what legitimizes it. It is these people who\nbelieve Christianity is threatened. Because it's true--Christian dominance in\nAmerica and the West is being overshadowed by other worldviews. Praise God\nthat the Christian faith is not dependent on its 21st-century cultural\ndominance, but by the dominion of its eternal, glorious God. When you claim\nthat ISIS or the Democrats or whomever else is threatening Christianity, you\nspit in the face of the God who conquered sin and death because you're afraid\nhe can't conquer competing worldviews. Christianity doesn't have to be the\nmost popular worldview in America to be the right one. Sometimes I think\nAmerican evangelicals push for the widespread acceptance of Christianity\nbecause they want to be \"right\" more than they want the world to flourish in\nthe grace of God. No terrorist attack, peaceful mosque or Supreme Court\njustice can knock down the house whose cornerstone is Christ. But it will\ndemolish the house whose cornerstone is cultural favor. Romans 8:35 says, \"Who\nshall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or\npersecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?\" Or liberals, or\nISIS, or Supreme Court Justices, or car bombs? The foundation of our faith is\nseated on the throne because his work is finished. He's not concerned. Why\nshould we be?

            "input": "[ LOS ANGELES, September 29, 2017 -- Since everything in America from the\nNational Football League to Dr. Seuss has now been politicized, why let Yom\nKippur be free of politics? The Jewish day of atonement is supposed to be\nabout looking inward and admitting wrongs committed. Yom Kippur involves\nasking for forgiveness and vowing to do right by those we have wronged. It\nshould be about personal growth, not politics. Forget it. Politically liberal\nJews have spent decades issuing scorching indictments of all things\nRepublican. If it is a Republican, attack it. If it is a conservative, despise\nit. If it is President Donald Trump, vow to drive it from the face of the\nearth. Why bother engaging in the Yom Kippur ritual if the prayers are hollow\nand insincere? Why bother vowing to be kinder only to return to vicious\nideological bigotry the next day? Not all liberal Jews are ideological bigots.\nSome of them are the kindest people walking the planet. That rings as hollow\nto many people as saying that not all NFL players are desecrating the American\nflag. When you belong to a group, you get the benefits and drawbacks of that\ngroup. Politically liberal Jews have gone from being an oppressed people to\nbeing the very bullies they used to fear. Liberal synagogues are frequently\nnothing but extensions of Democrat Party headquarters. Since Yom Kippur is\nsupposed to challenge Jews, a real challenge for liberal Jews is in order.\nThey can apologize for every single intolerant word they ever sad about\nRepublicans conservatives and President Trump. They can apologize for refusing\nto accept that Republicans have a right to win elections, and then govern in a\nconservative manner. Acknowledge that Republicans are human beings. Admit that\nTrump is not Adolf Hitler, and all comparisons of any American to Nazis,\nfascists, and brownshirts are statements to be disavowed. Admit that the\nfather of Orthodox Jew Ivanka Trump is not an anti-Semite. Saying this is\ntough enough. Meaning a single word of it is even tougher. Yom Kippur should\nbe based on Torah, the Old Testament. The Torah is non-partisan. Not one word\nof Torah justifies a politically liberal position on climate change, abortion,\ngay marriage, or any other hot button social issue. If it did, many Orthodox\nJews who vote Republican and spend their entire lives reading Torah would be\nheretics. Liberal Jews may believe this, but they would be as wrong as they\nare about most things driven by emotion rather than data. Far too many liberal\nJews spend 364 days every year demonizing Republicans for existing and\nbreathing air. They declare America a racist nation led by bigoted white\nnationalists just because the 2016 electorate rejected Hillary Clinton. Then\nthese same liberal Jews show up to synagogue one day per year, offer half-\nhearted apologies, and then return to bashing conservatives the moment the\nfirst post-holiday bagel is shoved down their throats. Liberalism is not\nJudaism, and conservatism is not anti-Jewish. Yom Kippur being free of\npolitics would be a pleasant development for Jews everywhere. That is an\nunrealistic goal in a nation where the left politicizes anything and\neverything. The National Anthem and The Cat in the Hat are now political.\nExpecting liberal Jews to stop politicizing everything is too much to ask.\nAsking them to just skip Yom Kippur and stay home is also too much to hope\nfor. So since they have to inject politics into everything, at least let them\nadmit it, acknowledge the error of their ways, sincerely apologize for this,\nand most importantly, stop doing it. Americans In The Dark On Trump's Plan To\nEnd The U.S. Dollar As for me, I will not be spending my Yom Kippur promoting\nthe domestic terrorism known as social justice. I did not riot or try to\nsilence anyone just for speaking words I disagree with. I am far from perfect,\nbut at least I know that someone in a synagogue can disagree with me and still\nbe a fellow Jew. I can even be friends with Jews who supported the anti-USA,\nanti-Israel Iran deal. I have plenty to atone for, but ideological bigotry is\nnot on that list. My thoughts in synagogue will be focused on God, not earth\nGoddess Gaea. The only climate I will be trying to change is my own behavioral\nclimate. As for liberal Jews, let us see how long they can go after breaking\nthe fast before they return to hating Republicans and rendering their entire\nYom Kippur prayers meaningless. ](https://commdiginews-wpengine.netdna-\nssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/yom_kippur-doa-1.jpg)[\n](http://www.whatfinger.com)[ August 2018 M T W T F S S\n](http://www.whatfinger.com)« Jul 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\n",

I was honored to speak out on behalf of American\nvalues and our democracy.\" Transcript: STEPHEN COLBERT: Folks, I am terribly\nexcited, because she was first a First Lady, then a Senator, then Secretary of\nState, and I would have bet anything the next President of the United States.\nPlease welcome Hillary Rodham Clinton! [audience cheers and applause as\nHillary Clinton walks out; she shakes Stephen Colbert's hand as they greet\neach other warmly; a large part of the audience gives her a standing ovation;\nshe takes her seat on stage to extended cheers and applause] COLBERT: Thank\nyou so much for being here. CLINTON: Oh, Stephen, it's good to see you.\nCOLBERT: It's good to see you. It's an honor to have you here. CLINTON:\nThanks! COLBERT: You have a new book. It's called \"What Happened.\" And I don't\nknow how else to start this interview, other than saying: What happened?!\n[audience laughter; Clinton laughs] What happened? CLINTON: Well, that's the\nquestion I try to answer. COLBERT: Okay. CLINTON: Yeah, because it was the\nquestion I asked myself starting on election night. COLBERT: Mm-hmm. CLINTON:\nAnd I started-- COLBERT: What time on election night? [audience laughter]\nCLINTON: Ugh! Well, as I write in the book: Midnight. [shrugs] Midnight.\nCOLBERT: Yeah, I remember. CLINTON: The dark time of the soul. Midnight.\n[audience laughter] COLBERT: Yeah, I'm waiting for it to not be midnight soon.\n[audience laughter] CLINTON: Yeah, right. And so I -- I was asking it like you\njust said: What happened?! You know? And I figured, maybe I'd better try to\nfind out, to figure it out. So that's why I dove into this book. It was, ah,\nvery painful and difficult, but, at the end, I really feel like I've done my\nvery best to lay out what happened so that it doesn't happen again. I mean,\nthat's my primary goal here is so that it doesn't happen again. [lengthy\naudience cheers and applause] COLBERT: Well, a lot of people have said, \"Oh,\nI, boy, I wish Hillary Clinton would just go away.\" CLINTON: Yeah. COLBERT:\n\"Just go away.\" CLINTON: Well, you know, if they take up a collection and send\nme somewhere really nice-- [audience laughter] COLBERT: Really? [chuckles]\nCLINTON: I might consider it! COLBERT: Really? Yeah! CLINTON: But it, you\nknow-- COLBERT: Obama's on David Geffen's yacht a lot. You could go with him.\n[audience laughter] CLINTON: [shrugs] Well, you know, I -- I am not going\nanywhere. [massive audience applause] COLBERT: Well, I'm glad you're not!\nCLINTON: So. [extended audience cheers and applause; Clinton smiles and\nchuckles] COLBERT: I agree. At first I could understand some of those calls --\npeople saying like, \"The Republicans are tearing themselves apart; don't give\nthem, you know, someone to rally around in opposition to,\" because you are a\nconvenient figure for them to unite against. CLINTON: Right. COLBERT: But I\nactually do not think that's how what's happening to our government is going\nto be stopped. I think it's people who are willing to be civically engaged and\nbelieve in the promises and the progress of the last fifty years that will\nsave this country. CLINTON: I agree completely-- COLBERT: So thank you so much\nfor not going away. CLINTON: --absolutely completely! COLBERT: But wait a\nsecond: It must not have been easy. CLINTON: No. COLBERT: It must not have\nbeen easy to write this book. CLINTON: It -- it wasn't easy! I mean, it was\npainful. It was horrible reliving it, and, you know, being as candid, open as\nI could be about the mistakes I made and talking about those. But also trying\nto come to grips, as I write in the book, about everything from, you know,\nsexism and misogyny, to voter suppression, to the unusual behavior of the\nformer director of the FBI, and the Russians. And the Russians! -- and you\nhave been sounding the alarm about this -- because I believe so strongly that\nthey think they succeeded in messing with our democracy, and I just can't\nabide that, so-- COLBERT: Do you think they succeeded in messing with our\ndemocracy? CLINTON: Yes I do. I do. I do. Because-- COLBERT: To what degree?\nLike, influencing the vote? Or influencing opinion? CLINTON: Influencing\nvoters, and therefore influencing opinion, I think is becoming clearer and\nclearer. I don't know what the Congressional investigations and I don't know\nwhat the Special Counsel investigation are going to find; I'm gonna wait for\nthat. But I don't think anybody can with a straight face say that the Russians\ndid not set out to influence our election, and they did so. This latest\nrevelation about the way they bought ads on Facebook and targeted them --\nwe're gonna find out a lot more, Stephen. And I am saying as clearly as I can\n-- I feel like I'm a bit of a, you know, a Paula Revere; I'm trying to sound\nthe alarm about this [audience laughter and applause] -- is that the-- You\nknow, you've gotta understand what Putin's strategy is. He really doesn't like\ndemocracy. He thinks it's an inconvenient, messy process. And he doesn't like\nus, and he wants to destabilize our country; sow doubt about our democracy. I\nmean, these latest revelations, where you had Russians pretending to be\nAmericans -- so you had fake Americans, with fake news, and fake stories, and\nfake demonstrations -- that wasn't just because he's bored and has nothing to\ndo. He wants to undermine how we see each other, how we respect each other,\nhow we support our institutions and our society. So, I think that they believe\nthey had a good outing in twenty-sixteen, and I think that they will be back\nin twenty-eighteen and twenty-twenty, unless we stop them. [audience applause]\nCOLBERT: Now, you mentioned that he -- that Putin doesn't like democracy and\nhe doesn't like America; part of the speculation is that he specifically\ndoesn't like you. Do you think this was personal on a certain level? CLINTON:\nI think it was mostly about the role I played as Secretary of State, which he\ndid morph into a grudge against me, because I would say things like, you know,\n\"The Russian people deserve free and fair elections. They deserve to have a\ndemocracy.\" COLBERT: Questioning the legitimacy of his election in two-\nthousand eleven. CLINTON: The parliamentary elections, that's right. And, so,\nour intelligence community and others have said that he did have a personal\ngrudge against me-- You know, I don't take it personally. I think it's part of\nhis worldview, which is all tied up with his anger, his disappointment in the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, and his feeling that we're his number one rival\n-- he wants to really undermine the European-American alliance. And so I see\nit as: I was doing my job -- I was honored to do my job, to stand up and speak\nout on behalf of American values and our democracy -- and, partly because I'm\na woman, which does seem to get him a bit agitated-- [audience cheers and\napplause] And he actually has said that, um, some things about that-- COLBERT:\nHas he -- did he ever say anything to you personally that demonstrated his\nmisogyny? CLINTON: Well, he demonstrated-- As I write in the book, you know,\nthere's an expression, we certainly know it in New York, called manspreading.\n[audience laughter] COLBERT: [chuckling] Yes. CLINTON: And every time I met\nwith him, it would be-- [spreads her arms and flops back in her chair, taking\nup lots of space] Okay? [audience laughter] The whole deal! And, so, I'd go to\nmeetings with him-- One in particular, we were in his dacha outside of Moscow,\nand the press comes in, and he just berates America about one of the many\nthings that annoys him about us, and then the press leaves, and I've got four\nor five things we're trying to deal with him and Russia on -- and I always\ncame to my meetings with him trying to find something that I could actually\nengage him about. So, we went through the economy and human rights and all\nthese other things that are critically important, and he was, you know--\n[mimes staring off into space] Like, as President Obama once said, like the\nbored guy in the back of the room. He couldn't care less. Then I said: \"You\nknow, I am really pleased to hear that you care about wildlife conservation,\nand that you are trying to save species in Russia, like Siberian tigers and\npolar bears.\" Then he came alive! And then we had an interesting conversation,\nso-- COLBERT: [mimicking Putin] \"I wrestle polar bears!\" [audience laughter]\nCLINTON: Yeah! \"I wrestle po--\" No, he said to me, so he said: \"Come with me!\"\nHe takes me down the stairs, down this corridor, into the door -- all of his\nsecurity guys are jumping up, because we weren't expected -- into this inner\nsanctum with this huge desk and the biggest map of Russia I think exists, and\nhe started telling me he's \"going here to tag polar bears.\" And then he says\nto me: \"Would your husband like to come?\" [audience gasps and laughter;\nClinton grins broadly] And I said, \"Well, you know, I'll ask him, but, if he's\nbusy, I'll go!\" [she grins as the audience cheers] COLBERT: We're gonna take a\nlittle break, and when we come back, Secretary Clinton and I just might break\nout the chardonnay.\n\n",

Now the FBI\nwon't release information in regards to their investigation of 59 people\nkilled in Las Vegas. This further tarnishes this respected organization's good\nname. James Comey hurt the FBI's name immensely by the actions he took\nsurrounding Hillary Clinton in last year's campaign. Liberals believe Comey\ngave the election to President Trump because her name was tarnished from\nComey's actions but they totally disregard her criminal actions that led her\nto be in that place. Conservatives felt like Comey gave Hillary a pass for her\nobvious criminal actions. On June 27th Bill Clinton met with US Attorney\nGeneral Loretta Lynch in her plane in Arizona for a half an hour. Within a\nweek Lynch's Department of [Justice dropped the\ninvestigation](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3898754/Attorney-\nGeneral-SUED-come-clean-secret-meeting-Bill-Clinton-days-decide-charging-wife-\nserver-scandal.html) into Hillary's emails and FBI's Comey made the\nannouncement. Comey's statements were later compared to Hillary's prior\nstatements - After FBI Director Comey announced that the FBI would not\nrecommend criminal charges be filed against Hillary, he was grilled in\nCongress by US Representative Trey Gowdy - Comey then announced in late\nOctober, shortly before the election that the FBI was reopening its\ninvestigation into Hillary's emails. Apparently emails recovered in the\npervert Anthony Wiener case ended up being related to the Hillary\ninvestigation. Wiener was the husband of Clinton confidant Huma Abedin and\nreportedly Clinton emails were found on Huma's computer after Huma stated\nunder oath that all her emails were turned over. A week or so later, again\nComey let Hillary off again. This was in spite of the fact that an email\nreleased from WikiLeaks showed that Hillary's longtime assistant Cheryl Mills\nordered Hillary's email server to be bleached clean. There was and is more\nthan enough information in the public arena to have Hillary brought to court\nfor her actions. After President Trump was elected President he fired Comey as\nHead of the FBI. After this Comey appeared at a Congressional Hearing and\nafter berating President Trump stated under oath that he had leaked classified\ninformation to the press (a clear crime). Former Director Mueller was even\nworse. He was Comey's mentor.

Mueller is a bad cop for other\nreasons. Although he has many conflicts of interest he went ahead and accepted\nthe position to investigate the fake Trump colluded with Russia story. Even\nliberal publications like the [USA\nToday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/19/we-need-robert-\nmueller-resignation-or-second-special-counsel-glenn-reynolds-\ncolumn/102990890/)reported in June that Mueller should step down as special\nprosecutor because of his conflicts of interest with the investigation he is\ncarrying on. Another reason and more justification for Mueller being a bad cop\nis related to the personnel he has hired to assist in the Russia\ninvestigation. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's fifteen attorneys are a Who's\nWho of Liberal Activism. He is not performing an investigation, he is on a\nliberal witch hunt. This leads us to today. Last night a press conference was\nheld jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the\nrecent killing of at least 59 people in that city a few days ago. The Sheriff\nwas very transparent in the information he supplied. But the major question\nthat everyone wants to know is - why did the killer do it? What was his\nmotive? At this point, the FBI Investigator took the microphone. Instead of\nproviding any information relevant to the mass murder - suicide, he berated\neveryone there and the millions watching on TV. The Special Agent In Charge\nfor the Las Vegas Division of the FBI said: Our resolve is firm. We will get\nto the bottom of this no matter how long it takes…we must focus on facts. We\ncannot give into conjecture. We cannot respond to every little Twitter feed\nthat may indicate a theory. We need to be focused on the facts. You need us to\nbe right. You expect us to be right and we want to be right…. After\ninterviewing the killer's girlfriend and God knows what else the FBI has\nuncovered, they provide nothing. The FBI's lack of transparency along with the\ncorrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin\nforming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI. It's time\nthat the FBI cleans shop and restores it name and reputation. Sponsored\nSponsored\n\n",

And what THAT means is Robert Mueller was\nwiretapping the Trump White House. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ALLOWED BEFORE. Early\nreports indicate at least one direct phone call between President Trump and\nCohen was surveilled/recorded.

            "input": "Asking the wrong questions will yield the wrong answers. If you ask yourself,\nas President Trump did -- \"Does anybody really want to throw out good,\neducated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the\nmilitary? [...] They have been in our country for many years through no fault\nof their own -- brought in by parents at a young age\"\\- you will surely find\nthe answer is no. However, if you ask yourself if you should support the\nproposed resurgence of the flagrantly unconstitutional and unjust \"amnesty\"\nthat greatly disadvantages American millennials, the answer is less clear. The\nresurgence of the debate over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\npolicy would put all millennials in direct competition with illegal immigrants\nwho were granted DACA permits, whether it be through college admissions, job\nopportunities, or wages. DACA creates competition in the higher education\nsystem that inherently favors illegal immigrants through policies such as\naffirmative action. Affirmative action mandates equal opportunities for, and\noften results in a larger presence of, minority groups in workplaces and, most\nnotably, universities. Dreamers with permits qualify for affirmative action,\ngiving young immigrants an advantage over not just the skilled worker, but\nalso American college applicants. DACA recipients have seized on American\nmillennials' ability to receive financial aid and college scholarships in\nmultiple states. Approximately one out of every four DACA recipients -- [about\n200,000 individuals -- live in\nCalifornia](http://www.ppic.org/publication/undocumented-immigrants-in-\ncalifornia/). California allows Dreamers to receive in-state college tuition\nand 19 other states have followed suit. The California Dream Act, embolden by\nDACA, has set a precedent for states to generously allocate funding to\nstudents who have entered or were brought into the country Illegally.\nCalifornia is merely one example of states diverting funding from the middle\nclass to fund Dreamers. To fund the Cal Grant entitlement for the state's\n\"neediest\" students, California has [\"phased-out\" the Middle-Class Scholarship\nProgram](http://www.kcra.com/article/why-the-middle-class-scholarship-could-\nget-cut-this-year/8956490). Implementing the California Dream Act made certain\nthat undocumented and nonresident students are eligible for state financial\naid, and that alone accounts for $67 million of the increase in Cal Grant\nspending. However, California students and taxpayers are not the only ones who\nhave felt the impact and burden of DACA. California serves as an example of\nhow scholarship and state-funded aid for the average DACA recipient creates a\ndisadvantage for Americans of similar income classes. Middle-Class American\nstudents are less likely to receive financial aid from universities and\ninstitutions, due to the diverting funds, implemented in State Dream Acts,\nemboldened by DACA. Additionally, DACA creates competition in the workforce,\nfor the millions of jobless American millennials. Currently, over 10 percent\nof millennials remain unemployed. There are 800,000 millennials from other\ncountries who are competing legally in the workplace for the same occupations\nwhere American millennials are looking for work. According to the Migration\nPolicy Institute, there are an estimated [2.1 million illegal\nimmigrants](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/diploma-please-promoting-\neducational-attainment-daca-and-potential-dream-act-eligible-youth) who are\nDACA-eligible in the United States in addition to the 800,000 already\nenrolled. However, the ultimate issue facing both millennials and Americans is\nthat DACA allows for unjust amnesty. The United States admits approximately 1\nmillion legal permanent immigrants every year, which is more than any other\nnation in the world. It is unjust to the millions of Americans and resident\nlegal immigrants who followed the rules. Giving blanket amnesty to those who\nneglect to follow our laws is irresponsible and rewards those who fail to\nfollow the rules. Refusing to enforce the law equally, by making special\nexceptions for favored groups, puts a burden on citizens and lawful residents\nin the states (especially border states) with the irresponsible federal\nabdication of immigration law. DACA also blatantly encourages more illegal\nimmigrants to enter the United States in hopes of future amnesty. Granting\nlegal status to Dreamers streamlines the pipeline of illegal immigration\nthrough extended family sponsorship. This is a slippery slope for America. The\nnarrative on DACA touts the promise of the American dream by advertising the\nmany who have benefited from the system. What it fails to mention are the\nimpacts and burdens DACA has thrust upon the American millennials.

In 1992, Hillary told Esquire\nmagazine that if she had the chance to cross examine Flowers, she would\n\"crucify her.\" Taking such determined steps to destroy a woman's reputation in\norder to protect her husband's political career smacks of depressingly cynical\ncalculation. The Clintons hired a famous private investigator to dig up the\nwomen's pasts with the aim of destroying their reputations. It is not clear\nfrom the Times' reporting to what degree Mrs Clinton favoured this tough\napproach. Did she drive it or just give it an accepting nod? Maybe the more\nrelevant point is that she condoned it. Hillary also famously called Ms\nLewinsky a \"narcissistic loony toon,\" according to a friend's testimony. A\nstaff member who was close to Hillary said she referred to Mr Clinton's\naffairs as \"bimbo eruptions\". And there's the problem for young women voters.\nWhy should the character or the sexual past of these women be relevant to the\ntruthfulness of their claims? Indeed, Mr Clinton went on to confess to affairs\nwith both Ms Flowers and Ms Lewinsky, after initially denying them. By\ndiscrediting the women, the Clintons were spreading the subliminal message\nthat it was somehow their fault more than Bill's. What were they trying to\nprove - that he was led astray by sexual predators? In 2016 that sounds\ngrotesque. How it all started for Hillary Clinton How it all started for\nHillary Clinton Today's sexual mores are very different from the 1980s and\n1990s. Young women today expect women to stand up for other women,\nparticularly in the area of sexual relations and particularly when those\nsexual relations involve a very powerful man and a younger woman. Younger\nwomen who have been through bruising college sexual abuse scandals across\nAmerica have little tolerance for women who in any way cast blame on the\nvictim. That empathy extends to consensual affairs - they just don't like\nwomen shaming other women. Which is exactly what Hillary Clinton was complicit\nin doing, according to the New York Times, and other previous accounts. Mrs\nClinton's supporters say this is all old news, and is part of a right-wing\nattempt to slime her. Many millennial voters weren't even born when Monica and\nBill were cavorting in the Oval Office. This is their first introduction to\nthis sordid story. However the Clinton campaign tries to spin it, it just\ndoesn't look great for their candidate.\n\n",

Fast forward to\npresent day (or, more accurately, last night), and we now have former House\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich (and current Trump surrogate) literally daring Kelly to\ncall Bill Clinton a \"sexual predator\" on live television after trying to\ndenounce the coverage of Trump's numerous sexual misconduct allegations as\nunfair and biased. Thank goodness there are only 13 more days till the\nelection because, honestly, how much more of this can the American people\ntake? What began as a conversation between the Fox News anchor and former\nspeaker of the house about Donald Trump's dwindling poll numbers soon turned\ninto a hostile exchange about sexism, media bias, and the election. Recent\nreports, including one conducted by Fox News, show Clinton's numbers growing\nin several key states, making Trump's chances of becoming president all the\nmore slim. Gingrich quickly interjected that all these polls are biased--\"Fox\nNews? I don't think so,\" Kelly countered--before he launched into an attack on\nthe media as a whole for focusing on the Access Hollywood tape and the\nnumerous women who have come forward to corroborate the things Trump\narticulated on the leaked footage, rather than the leaked transcripts of\nHillary Clinton's Wall Street speeches or her plans to allow \"600 million\npeople\" to migrate to the country. \"The three major networks spent 23 minutes\nattacking Donald Trump [after the third presidential debate] and 57 seconds on\nHillary Clinton's secret speeches,\" Gingrich said. \"You don't think this is a\nscale of bias worthy of Pravada and Izvestia?\" (Quick history aside: Pravada\nand Izvestia were two newspapers published in Soviet Russia.) Kelly\narticulated that \"if Trump is a sexual predator\"--which Gingrich quickly\ndenied--and was revealed to have a lengthy history of sexual misconduct,\nAmericans--especially American women--have the right to know this about a\npresidential nominee and the media should be required to cover it. Or so she\ntried to articulate before Gingrich once again interrupted her for using\n\"inflammatory\" language \"that is not true.\" \"You are fascinated by sex and you\ndon't care about public policy,\" said a man who spent his tenure as speaker of\nthe house obstructing the president and twenty-plus years dwelling on Bill\nClinton's sexual history. \"Me? Really?\" Kelly countered, before Gingrich\ndoubled down, saying, \"That's what I get out of watching you tonight.\" Kelly\nresponded to this, saying, \"You know, Mr. Speaker, I'm not fascinated by sex,\nbut I am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what we're\ngetting in the Oval Office and I think the American voters would like to\nknow.\" \"Therefore we're going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing\nbecause, after all, you're worried about sexual predators?\" Gingrich\ninterjected. \"Listen, it's not about me. It's about the women and men of\nAmerica. The poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular,\nare very concerned about these allegations, and, in large part, believe they\nare a real issue and don't want to dismiss the women.\" Kelly barely made her\npoint before Gingrich once again interrupted, saying, \"You want a comment on\nwhether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator?\" \"We, on\nThe Kelly File, have covered that story as well,\" she countered. \"I want to\nhear you use the words 'Bill Clinton, sexual predator.' I dare you. Say 'Bill\nClinton, sexual predator,\" Gingrich said, smirking all the while. Kelly, as\nexpected, kept her cool, explained that she had, in fact, covered Clinton's\npast behavior on her show, before making the most sound counter-argument to\nGingrich's challenge. \"He's not on the ticket,\" Kelly said. \"The polls also\nshow the American public is less interested in the deeds of Hillary Clinton's\nhusband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him\npresident, Donald Trump.\" As the segment drew to an end, Kelly bid farewell to\nher contentious guest, saying, \"We're going to have to leave it at that and\nyou can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr.\nSpeaker. Thanks for being here.\" To which Gingrich replied, \"And you too.\"\nWatch the full segment below.\n\n",

            "input": "\"Bigger than Watergate!\" Donald Trump exulted about the discovery of new\nemails from Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state. Sure, they could be.\nThey could also be pleas from Clinton that Huma Abedin fetch her a skinny\nlatte from Starbucks. We don't know. And the horrifying thing is that the\nF.B.I. director, James Comey, didn't seem to know, either, even as he\ndisclosed their existence to the world. How strange but how fitting. This\nentire election is being conducted in the key of hysteria, and Comey just\nfound a way to amplify that ugly music. Listen, Clinton made an awful decision\nin setting up a private email server, then compounded that error by dragging\nher feet through defensive non-apologies that gave the story such legs. Now\nshe limps to the finish line when she should be hitting full stride. But Trump\nis as much of a part and player in this latest chapter of the email saga,\nbecause of the one-syllable grenade that he keeps lobbing at the body politic,\nhis furious mantra over these final weeks. \"Rigged,\" \"rigged,\" \"rigged.\" Many\nAmericans have come to believe that. Many others are rightly determined to\nprove to that group how wrong they are, or at least not to add accelerant to\nthe wildfire. And so all of us, including Comey, operate in a befouled\natmosphere, tailoring our actions to it. Comey obviously felt that he was in a\nbind and clearly believed that by disclosing the emails as soon as possible --\nand not, say, delaying until he had some sense of what the F.B.I. was dealing\nwith -- he had the best chance of avoiding any possible charges of a cover-up\nlater, and was acting with the cleanest conscience. But his desire to be a Boy\nScout may have eclipsed sound judgment here, and rectitude is a quaint,\nshortsighted notion in an election this rife with accusations of bias, this\nprimed for scandal, this frenzied. Were the emails in question sent to or from\nClinton? Comey didn't and perhaps couldn't say. What about them warranted\ninspection? Again, he had nothing to offer. He told F.B.I. employees in a memo\nthat he was hoping, with his announcement, not \"to create a misleading\nimpression\" of some hugely significant discovery. But that's exactly and\npredictably what he did. Most Democrats were outraged. \"Mr. Comey said he was\nduty bound to inform Congress,\" Bob Kerrey, the former senator and governor,\ntold me. \"Quite the opposite is the case. He was duty bound to make an\nannouncement after he completes his examination of the emails.\" Indeed, he\nbroke with the longstanding F.B.I. policy of not commenting on ongoing\ninvestigations. He also defied the wishes of senior officials in the\nDepartment of Justice, according to various news reports early Saturday\nafternoon. And he frustrated everyone -- conservatives, liberals, Trump,\nClinton -- because his disclosure was all questions, no answers. Regardless,\nthe media went nuts, declaring that the development could bend the shape of\nthe race and assuming damage to Clinton without any polling or other evidence\nto back that up. \"We don't know what this means yet except that it's a real\nbombshell,\" the journalist Carl Bernstein said in a phone interview on CNN on\nFriday, adding: \"It is unthinkable that the director of the F.B.I. would take\nthis action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of\nthe United States saying there is more information out there about classified\nemails and call it to the attention of Congress unless it was something\nrequiring serious investigation.\" A viewer couldn't see him licking his chops\nbut could hear it. Even the many news organizations that stressed the possible\ninnocuousness of the emails and emphasized how very little we knew\ncontradicted that caution with the length, number and front-and-center\nplacement of their stories about this development. Why? The Politico writer\nGlenn Thrush had a thought, expressed in this tweet: How is this supposed to\nplay out? If, a few days from now, the F.B.I. determines and announces that\nnone of the emails contain classified information or anything else of concern,\nwill Trump and Clinton's other enemies conceivably believe that? Hah! They'll\nbe shouting \"rigged\" all over again. They'll be shouting it louder than ever.\nIt wouldn't be normal practice for the F.B.I., in an effort to buttress its\ndetermination, to release the emails, many of which are presumably private\ncommunications of Abedin's. And those might be too intimate for her to make\npublic herself. But now that Comey has flagged the whole batch of them,\nsuspicion will never die. And if the emails are fresh cause for concern, will\nthat be knowable, and digestible, before Nov. 8? On this point, too, we're all\nin the dark. What a steaming mess, and that's a comment partly on this\nspecific situation but also on this election, which has devolved into a\njunkyard of innuendo, lies and conspiracy theories. Trump doesn't bear all the\nblame for that, but he bears an ample share of it. On the subject of\nconspiracy theories, I can offer some comic relief, noting that he and Rush\nLimbaugh couldn't get on the same page about the new emails on Friday. Even as\nTrump was praising Comey and saying that the election might not be quite as\nrigged as he'd feared, Limbaugh was telling his listeners that Comey was \"just\ndoing this to take everybody's attention off of the WikiLeaks email dump\" that\nwas embarrassing Clinton and her aides. \"The cynical view,\" he said, \"is that\nComey is still carrying water for Clinton and is trying to get everybody to\nstop paying attention on the WikiLeaks dump because it's starting to have an\nimpact.\" Let me get this straight: The crooked F.B.I. and the corrupt media\nthrow just enough dirt at Clinton so that she's sure to track it into the Oval\nOffice? Thank God for Limbaugh. God help the rest of us.\n\n",

Liberals Bash FBI Director Comey Over Clinton Probe\nAfter Praising Him in July Mother of Jailed Sailor: 'Hold Hillary to Same\nStandards' as My Son on Classified Info The FBI's ability to get Huma Abedin-\nHillary Clinton's closest advisor, confidante and State Department deputy\nchief of staff - to sing will make or break this election. Right now, reports\nare the FBI is negotiating with Huma's lawyers, stemming from her joint\ncomputer with pervert husband, disgraced ex -congressman Anthony Weiner. Here\nwe go again: We are nine days from an election that will redefine this nation.\nAnd as I said last night, we're on the precipice of yet another constitutional\ncrisis because of the Clintons. This time, involving an alleged pedophile, our\nnation's top secrets and a couple of grifters from Arkansas. You already know\nhow I feel about all this from my open last night. The American people are\nentitled to know before we go to the voting booth what it was that caused FBI\nDirector Comey to reopen the case. He's got to tell us what was discovered\nwhat was so big that he violated Justice Department and FBI guidelines and\nalerted the nation. He cannot hide behind protocol. The Justice guidelines\n'don't let me talk' rule doesn't work anymore. The 'we don't comment on\npending cases' doesn't work anymore. There are no ethical prohibitions. You\nhave been invited by the target and her surrogates to release the information\nthat caused you to reopen a closed case. If there is an indictment, Hillary is\nnow foreclosed from objecting to such disclosure. My bet is, she knows you\nwont - but thinks that she's calling your bluff. If she really wanted to know,\nall she has to do is sit down with Huma and ask her. The investigation is then\nnot compromised, since documentary evidence - here emails - do not change. So\nit's time to do what you didn't do last year- a thorough unbiased\ninvestigation, using all the tools available search warrants and empaneling a\ngrand jury. No more mother may I routine. You're the one who got yourself in\nthis mess. And now the American people are in a bigger mess. In 2013 Huma\nsigned a document under penalty of perjury when she left the state department\nthat she had turned over all classified materials and that she was not\nretaining copies. It seems that metadata on 650 thousand emails suggest\notherwise. Huma swore under oath that she searched thru all her devices for\nanything state related. She had a chance to turn things over and she didn't.\nStart your negotiation there, Mr. Director. You've got her in a corner. It's\ntime to throw some punches. Make your deal with Huma now. If you don't and\nHillary gets elected, no one will care. Hillary will do what she's always\ndone. She'll be appalled at Huma. She'll say she didn't know. She didn't\nremember. She short-circuited. She had a brain clot. She had no idea. Look,\nthe American people are already traumatized by the Clinton scandals and we\njust can't take 4 more years of them. Word is that although Justice told your\nFBI guys to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation, it's still\nongoing. The justice dept. is dirty and you know it. Our attorney general\nactually pleaded the fifth on the Iran ransom probe. Loretta Lynch meeting\nwith the spouse of a target and then the target herself days later saying I\nwill keep Loretta Lynch as my attorney general is bribery pure and simple.\nJim, go back to your roots. You were once a great prosecutor. Don't let\nWashington ruin you too. You need to send these Clintons back to where they\ncame from. It's time for you to buck up put on your big boy pants and make a\ndeal with Huma for the sake of this nation. You've got till Tuesday.\n\n",

            "input": "From Israel's prime minister down to the lowliest clerk, from the Commander in\nChief down to the lowest ranking officer, from the Mossad down to the police\nby way of the Shabak - since 1994, everyone has been chanting the same mantra\nabout peace with Jordan. The prevalent reasoning is that peace with Jordan is\nIsrael's most important strategic resource for the following reasons:\n1.Security: The 500-kilometer border between Israel and Jordan is Israel's\nlongest border with another country, reaching from Hamat Gader and the Yarmouk\nRiver in the north down to Eilat in the south. Jordan makes sure the border is\nquiet along its entire length and prevents hostile forces from approaching it\nand continuing west into Israel. If not for the peace declared between the two\nstates, Israel would have to keep large forces along the border to guard it\nagainst infiltration. Israel sees the very existence of Jordan to its east as\na security asset in itself because Jordan acts as a buffer zone between the\nJewish state and the violent chaos in Iraq, Syria, and Iran. There is full\ncooperation between the Jordanian and Israeli armies, including visits by\nofficers, the handing over of information, and coordinated activity along the\nborder, under the assumption that radical groups are a shared enemy. In\nexchange for this, it is said, Israel played a part in guarding Jordan's\nnorthern and eastern borders during the years 2014-16, the period when ISIS\nposed a threat to Jordan. 2. Jordan is the second Arab nation to have signed a\npeace treaty with Israel, proving that Israel can find itself accepted in the\nMiddle East as a sustainable country with whom former enemies can make peace\nby rethinking their previous positions. This could occur despite the August\n1967 Khartoum Arab summit where it was declared that the Arab nations would\nnot recognize Israel, would not negotiate with Israel and would not make peace\nwith it. King Hussein of Jordan was a party to these decisions but carried on\nnegotiations with Israel, recognized it and signed a peace treaty, as did\nEgypt before him. The obvious conclusion is that any Arab nation can do the\nsame, making peace with Jordan a significant accomplishment,  3\\. There is a\nwide array of cooperative ties between Israel and Jordan, mostly in the\neconomic sphere. Three issues are involved: a. Israel has a multi-billion\ndollar contract with Jordan according to which it sells gas extracted from\nIsrael's Mediterranean gas fields to Jordan's electricity company; b. Israel\nrecognized \"Qualified Industrial Zones\" in which Israeli funds are invested,\nJordanians are employed and Americans are the buyers, providing employment for\nthousands of Jordanian families; c. cooperative ventures such as the Water\nCanal, tourism, flights, trade, and academia - thousands of Israeli Arab\nstudents attend Jordanian Universities and their degrees are recognized in\nIsrael. In exchange for recognition, Israel granted the Hashemite Kingdom, and\nespecially its king, special status in the Jerusalem sites considered holy by\nIslam, mainly the al Aqsa Mosque, giving Hussein and his son Abdullah today, a\nsignificant stamp of approval in the Islamic world. This stamp of approval is\nespecially important in granting much-needed legitimacy to the Hashemite\nKingdom. The Palestinian majority and even some Bedouin groups question that\nlegitimacy, since the Hashemites are not originally Jordanian, having come\nfrom the western section of the Arabian Peninsula, Hijaz, where the two\nIslamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina are located. The British gave the\nTransjordan Emirate to Abdullah I, great grandfather of today's Abdullah. He\nis considered a foreign transplant, giving rise to questions of legitimate\nrule, and the special status at al Aqsa is intended to give him a shot of\nlegitimacy, stabilizing his regime. The king pays the salaries of hundreds of\nJerusalem Waqf officials. Another payment Israel took upon itself is the\nhanding over of 50 million cubic meters of drinkable water to Jordan every\nyear. The plan was to bring this water from the Sea of Galilee, but the\ndrought of the last few years has lowered the level of the water in the lake,\nso Israel has substituted expensive desalinated water instead. Jordanian\nagriculture in the Jordan Valley is made possible in part because of this\nIsraeli water. All the points raised here give Israel the feeling that the\npeace agreement with Jordan is successful, certainly more successful than the\none with Egypt, with whom there is much less cooperation on non-security\nrelated issues. Israel's payment for this by handing over water and securing\nJordan's status in Jerusalem is one Israel can handle in exchange for the\npremise that peace with Jordan serves Israeli interests. All the parties to\nIsrael's government are united in supporting the maintenance of peace with\nJordan at all costs. Where did we go wrong? The first and main point is that\nIsrael ignores the fact that the peace agreement is totally dependent on the\ncontinuation of the illegitimate Hashemite dynasty. In 1994 that meant\nHussein, today it is Abdullah II, but the future is unclear because there are\nquite a few people in Jordan and outside it who see Abdullah as the last\nHashemite monarch. What comes next? There are several possible answers to that\nquery, ranging from a military junta made up of local Bedouin ruling the\nvarious populations, on to a civil war that leads to the country splitting in\ntwo, with a Palestinian state rising in the northwestern part of the country\nwhere there is a Palestinian Arab majority. It is no secret that the\nPalestinian majority in Jordan is opposed to the peace treaty with Israel. One\nreason is the recognition a treaty grants Israel and another is the fact that\nit does not include the so-called \"right of return\" of the 1948 refugees to\nwithin Israeli borders, including compensation for the possessions they left\nbehind them and the years of suffering they underwent in refugee camps. The\nPalestinian majority in Jordan feels no commitment to the peace agreement; it\nwas signed by King Hussein, not by them. For this reason, most of the\nprofessional associations in Jordan - lawyers, journalists, doctors and others\n- do not allow their members to partner with Israelis. Most of their members\nare Palestinian Arabs who see the peace agreement as the result of the king's\nbetrayal of their cause. [ The peace agreement upon which Israel and Jordan\nare signed and everything Israel has paid, is paying and is willing to pay to\npreserve and guard that peace will be utterly worthless the day a rebellion\nbreaks out against the king, or some assassin or suicide bomber, G-d forbid,\nsucceeds in killing him. The house of cards Israel built around him will\ncollapse instantaneously, the peace agreement and any others signed in its\nwake will become fond memories. Whoever takes the king's place will restart\nthe process and expect Israel to pay even more than it had originally paid -\nthat is, if the country remains united. If that new leader is a Palestinian\nArab, the price will entail the return of a significant number of 1948\nrefugees to the state of Israel, not to the Palestinian State that may exist\nby then. The king knows full well that the possibility that he could be\nassassinated by a Palestinian Arab, as his great grandfather was in 1951 in\nJerusalem, is not far-fetched. That is the reason his armed bodyguards are not\nArabs, but members of the Circassian ethnic minority who stem from the\nCaucasian Mountain region and do not have their eyes on the throne, meaning\nthat they are not suspected of planning to murder the king or poison his food.\nThe king's mistrust of the Palestinian Arabs, who make up the majority of his\nsubjects, has led him to keep them out of the armed forces, police, foreign\nministry and especially from internal security organizations and intelligence.\nThere are several Palestinian Arabs in the government and parliament who serve\nas token representatives, but the majority of them know exactly what the\nHashemites think of the majority of Jordan's citizenry, those who define\nthemselves as Palestinians - never calling themselves Jordanians because that\nis used for Bedouin, viewed as lower class by the Palestinians, who are\nfarmers and city dwellers. The Palestinian Arabs in Jordan are the economic\nengine of the country. They make up most of the merchants, manufacturers,\nbusinessmen, lawyers, accountants, academics, journalists, arts and media\npersonalities, and they generally avoid contact with Israel and Israelis. They\nconduct a consistent and strict boycott of Israel. The king respects their\nposition for two reasons: One, he has no way to force the peace agreement upon\nthem, and two, he is quite content to show Israel that the peace agreement is\nnot secure because of Palestinian opposition, allowing him to demand more and\nmore from Israel in order to guard its interests and keep the king in power.\nThe cost of the peace agreement with Israel is prohibitive. First, Israel\nrespects the status it granted the kingdom in Jerusalem, even though there is\nno precedent in the entire world for a sovereign state granting another\ncountry special rights in its capital city on that state's most holy site. In\n1994, when this was decided during the peace talks, Israel wasn't worried\nabout Hussein who hated Arafat and agreed with Israel that there must never be\na Palestinian state. The status Israel granted him on the Temple Mount was in\norder to prevent Arafat and the Islamic Movement from taking over the site.\nKing Abdullah II has turned Jordanian policy around and is an ardent supporter\nof the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria., one that\nwill be able to look over at Israel and threaten it with missiles and short\nrange mortars that hit from Dimona and Beer Sheva in the south, up along the\ncoastal plain from Ashkelon, the Ashdod port, greater Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion\nairport, to Haifa and its port and all the way to Afula and Beit She'an. Long\nrange weapons will threaten all the rest of Israel. Abdullah is actively\ncreating a strategic threat to the state of Israel that will most probably be\nruled by Hamas, which won most of the seats in the Palestinian legislature in\n2006 and led a violent takeover of Gaza in 2007. Abdullah would like to see\nthese scenarios repeat themselves, a most realistic possibility. King Abdullah\ndisplayed his hostility towards Israel poverty in two recent events. This past\nMarch he freed the Jordanian soldier who, in cold blood, murdered seven school\ngirls from Beit Shemesh in 1997 as they took part in a class trip to the\n\"Peace Island\" (!!!) in Naharayim. His father, King Hussein, came to pay a\ncondolence visit to the families in Beit Shemesh, while his son lets the\nmurderer go free. What price did he pay for this slap in the face to Israel?\nZilch. Nothing. ](http://offers.israel365.com/stand-against-\niran-1/?utm_source=bin&utm_medium=ubm_banners&utm_campaign=iran_petition)[Jordan\nacts against Israe](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/233821)l\nas a matter of course in international circles, especially UNESCO and the UN\nHuman Rights Council, two places that constantly attempt to delegitimize\nIsrael. Jordan encourages and pushes for the decisions that deny Jewish\ntradition in Jerusalem, undermining the historical and religious foundations\nfor the existence of the Jewish State. This is meant to spread the feeling to\nthe world that Israel's establishment is a result of British colonialism, one\nthat must be canceled so that \"Falestin\" is restored to its \"historical\nowners\" - the Palestinians. Abdullah, like the Palestinian Arabs, thinks that\nif he succeeds in removing Jerusalem from the State of Israel, the resulting\ndemoralization will send the Jews packing. Establishing a Palestinian Arab\nstate that will threaten Israel's security and destroy the Jewish state, is\nthe strategic objective of King Abdullah because it will prevent a Palestinian\nState from arising in Jordan. If a Palestinian state is created in the hills\nof Judea and Samaria, the king intends to get rid of all the Palestinian\nrefugees who entered Jordan in the 1948 war, about one and a half million\npeople, plus several hundred thousand who entered Jordan over the last seventy\nyears. A demographic pressure in the Palestinian state will become terrorist\npressure that turns life in Israel into Hell - exactly what Abdullah wants. He\ncoordinates his activities with Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas, seeing eye to eye\nwith them on the main goal - destroying Israel in order to save the Hashemite\nKingdom from becoming a nation of Palestinians. We would do well to remember\nwhat most of us have long forgotten: The clueless group of irresponsible\nIsraeli politicians who gave Jordan its unconditional and unlimited special\nstatus in Jerusalem is the same group whose idiotic policies brought terrorist\nArafat back from the garbage bin of politicians in Tunisia and granted him the\nclosest thing to a state, The stars of this stellar group included Shimon\nPeres, Yossi Beilin, and Alon Liel, who dragged Yitzchak Rabin into the most\ndangerous political trap, endangering the continued existence of the State of\nIsrael. Jordan today, it must be concluded, is working non-stop on the cover\nof its peace treaty with Israel to destroy the Jewish State and create a\nPalestinian one instead. What is worse is that Israel refuses to admit to the\nsituation and continues most carefully to keep the agreement, hoping calm will\nprevail along the border until the next elections. Every politician knows that\nif during his term, relations with Jordan deteriorate, the media - our\nshallow, slanted and agenda-ridden media - will accuse him of being the cause\nof the agreement's nullification, making him pay the price for the next round\nof elections. That is why politicians bolster up the temporary tactical quiet,\nignoring the strategic threat to the very existence of the state posed by the\npeace agreement. If Israel's leaders felt endangered by the actions of\nAbdullah, they would do something to prevent his destructive activities,\ncleverly disguised as military and economic cooperation. The problem is that\nin their view, short term tactical advantages are preferable to attending to\nstrategic problems that affect the long term. We are all going to pay a high\nprice for this way of running things on the part of Israel's decision makers -\nas can be seen by the security equipment crisis last month in Jerusalem. King\nHussein was all for Israel's continued existence and did not question\nJerusalem 's status. That's why peace with him was positive in general. His\nson Abdullah changed his father's strategy and works tirelessly to create a\nPalestinian state on the ruins of the destroyed Jewish one. Now that King\nAbdullah's nefarious scheme has been revealed, Israel must rethink its\nJordanian route and work to create a Palestinian Arab state in all or part of\nJordan, since the majority of the people there are Palestinian Arabs. The\nalternative is establishing a Palestinian state on Israeli territory with its\ncapital in Eastern Jerusalem, a strategic danger to Israel. There is no reason\nthat the Jewish people, who returned to its land after 2000 years of exile,\nshould pay with its very existence for the survival of the Hashemites brought\nby the British from Hijaz to rule the most artificial country in the world -\nJordan.

Thank\nYOU!\n********************************************************************************\nNine years ago, Christopher Mirasolo, 27, raped a woman. She got pregnant as a\nresult of the alleged crime. Now, Mirasolo--a convicted rapist--has been\n[awarded joint legal custody of the\nchild](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/10/06/rape-\nvictim-attacker-joint-child-custody/106374256/) by Detroit Judge Gregory S.\nRoss following a DNA paternity test which showed him to be the child's father.\nYes, you read that correctly. The man who made a child through rape, was\nconvicted of rape, and served time for rape, will now be granted joint custody\nof the child born from rape. The victim's attorney, Rebecca Kiessling, is now\nasking for special protection afforded to her client under the federal [Rape\nSurvivor Child Custody\nAct](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0604/With-new-US-law-more-\nfunding-to-protect-women-who-have-children-after-rape). The Act, which\nPresident Obama signed the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act into law on May 29,\n2015, terminates the parental rights of any parent who raped the opposite sex.\nThe decision to terminate the parental rights must be based on clear and\nconvincing evidence that the resulting child was conceived through rape.\nKiessling filed objections last Friday against Ross' decision to award custody\nto the parent who's believed to have raped the lady whose identity must be\nkept confidential because of the nature of the crime. Kiessling remarked: This\nis insane…Nothing has been right about this since it was originally\ninvestigated. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind\nbars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child\nherself when this all happened. So apparently angered by Ross' decision, the\nrape victim's attorney continued by accusing the court of implementing\ndeception to make the ruling. An assistant prosecutor on this, Eric Scott,\ntold me she had granted her consent, which was a lie -- she has never been\nasked to do this and certainly never signed anything In granting parental\nrights to Mirasolo, Ross has prevented the woman from fleeing the presence of\nher alleged attacker. In other words, the rape victim now has to be within\ndriving distance of her rapist at all times. And in a bizarre and some would\nsay ironic turn of events, the rape victim may, in fact, go to jail if she\ndoes not comply with the court's demands. Kiessling remarked that her client\nis, \"not allowed to move 100 miles from where she had been living when the\ncase was filed, without court consent.\" If she does not comply with the order,\nshe can be locked up. \"So the prosecutor told her she had to come home\nimmediately or she would be held in contempt of court,\" the rape victim's\nlawyer said. For anyone who may be wondering about the details of the alleged\nrape, the lawyer provided a glimpse into the kind of horrific and violent\ntorture the rape victim allegedly endured. She said Mirasolo raped her client\nwhen her client was just 12 and the man was 18. She described the incident in\ndetail. She, her 13-year-old sister and a friend all slipped out of their\nhouse one night to meet a boy and the boy's older friend, Mirasolo, showed up\nand asked if they wanted to go for a ride…They thought they were going to\nMcDonald's or somewhere…Instead, he tossed their cellphones away, drove to\nDetroit where he stole gas from a station and then drove back to Sanilac\nCounty, where he kept them captive for two days in a vacant house near a\nrelative, finally releasing the older sister in a park. He threatened to kill\nthem if they told anyone what happened. Instead of prosecuting Mirasolo to the\nfullest extent of the law, he was offered a plea deal for being a first-time\noffender and was back on the streets after less than 7 months in jail. He went\non to commit another rape on a young teenager in 2010 and served only four\nyears for the second rape. Now, Judge Ross has given him parental rights to\nhis first victim. Barbara Yockey, Mirasolo's attorney did not indicate her\nclient had any intention of being a parent to the child who happens to be the\nproduct of a reportedly brutal rape. Yockey said the paternity test and\nsubsequent custody proceedings were initiated after the other parent applied\nfor state services. Chris was notified of the paternity matter and an order of\nfiliation was issued last month by the court saying he had joint legal custody\nand reasonable visitation privileges…He never initiated this. It was something\nroutinely done by the prosecutor's office when a party makes application for\nstate assistance. The Detroit News also spoke with the mother. She, too, was\nunaware of the court's proceedings. She said; I think this is all crazy…They\n(officials) never explained anything to me. I was receiving about $260 a month\nin food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him. I guess they\nwere trying to see how to get some of the money back. Following the horrific\nrape, the victim dropped out of school and moved in with relatives in Florida.\nShe went to a government office to change her address and was notified she had\na court order demanding her return to Detroit. Part of me didn't want to come\nback home because I was scared…I would've got contempt of court if I hadn't\nshown. I would've been thrown in jail. With respect to the rape itself, she\nsaid: I didn't talk about it, I tried to put it behind me, but that's never\npossible. You never forget what happens. Tiffany, the name she gave to the\nhosts, which is not her real name, gave her opinion about Ross' decision to\nput her rapist's name on her son's birth certificate. (I'd been told), he'd\nhave to fight for any kind of rights…Then this judge just hands him these\nrights, like he deserves them. She's not alone in her belief that Mirasolo\nshould be denied parental rights. [The convicted rapist's second\nvictim](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/10/09/rapist-\nchild-custody-second-victim-similarities/106482954/) shares her sentiments.\nShe told reporters: When I read [the (Detroit News)\narticle](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/10/06/rape-\nvictim-attacker-joint-child-custody/106374256/), I was disgusted…I guess there\nis no way they can do anything to him, because he has already served sentences\nin both cases. But there is no way he should have custody…And I don't think he\nshould even be allowed around any children without supervision. Yes, America,\nthis is the judicial state of affairs in which many of our residents currently\nendure. A convicted rapist is given parental rights he didn't want, to a woman\nwho didn't want him to have any association with her or her child, and who'd\neven relocated out of state. The woman was ordered to return to the state\nwhere she was raped and forced to live within two hours drive of the\nperpetrator (100 miles). Worse still, she may actually be forced to confront\nher attacker when and if he ever wants to spend time with his biological\nchild.

Freedom Daily updated their page to\nidentify the right suspect, but perpetuated their \"leftists did it\" scenario\nby claiming the driver lost control while trying to \"escape\" anti-fascist\ndemonstrators who were allegedly throwing things at his car, and never meant\nto hurt anyone (a claim directly\n[contradicted](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2017/08/12/Protester-killed-at-\nCharlottesville-white-nationalist-rally/8841502557178/) by Charlottesville's\npolice chief, who described the vehicular attack as \"premeditated\"). All these\nreports dovetail into a grander conspiracy theory peddled by InfoWars founder\nAlex Jones and his ilk, exemplified in the rambling, hour-long video\n[rant](https://www.infowars.com/exclusive-virginia-riots-staged-to-bring-in-\nmartial-law-ban-conservative-gatherings/) below, part of an InfoWars.com post\nentitled \"Virginia Riots Staged to Bring in Martial Law, Ban Conservative\nGatherings\". In brief, Jones claims that the violence in Charlottesville is\nbut one example of a well-orchestrated plot by billionaire leftist George\nSoros, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the Southern\nPoverty Law Center (SPLC), \"globalists,\" the \"deep state\", Jewish actors\npretending to be neo-Nazis, and God only knows who else to foment unrest,\nstart a race war, bring down President Trump, and pave the way for martial law\nin the United States: We listened in vain for Jones to provide any evidence\nfor these claims beyond vague references to WikiLeaks e-mails in which highly\nplaced Democrats supposedly discussed \"controlling\" the populace by keeping\nthem \"in the dark\" and \"desperate\": Now, if you go back to the WikiLeaks from\nover a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending e-mails to George Soros and\nback and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, saying, \"We're\nlosing the public. Minorities are getting into free market. We want to keep\npeople in their mother's basements as baristas.' \"Remember even Hillary said\nthat. 'What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark,\nkeep them desperate. These are quotes. Hundreds and hundred of e-mails. We've\ncovered them, written articles about it, linking to them. They didn't deny\nthat they're real. They're real. They said what do we do? They said we go to\nculture war. \"These are quotes,\" Jones said, but when we attempted to verify\nthat Clinton actually uttered the words \"What are we going to do to keep\ncontrol of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate,\" we found nothing\nin any public sources, including [WikiLeaks.org](https://wikileaks.org/), to\nconfirm it -- and in point of fact, we found no published statements even\nvaguely resembling those. We were able to confirm something Hillary Clinton\ndid not say, however, namely: \"We want to keep people in their mother's\nbasements as baristas.\" Ironically, the place we were able to confirm it was\nJones' own web site, InfoWars.com, which in October 2016\n[reposted](https://www.infowars.com/clinton-describes-sanders-supporters-as-\nbasement-dwellers-baristas-in-leaked-recording/) an\n[article](https://www.rt.com/usa/361338-clinton-sanders-supporters-remarks/)\nfrom pro-Putin news site Russia Today alleging that Clinton had described\nrival Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders' younger supporters as \"basement\ndwellers\" and \"baristas\" -- which wasn't really accurate either. Here's what\nClinton really said, transcribed from an audio clip posted on InfoWars (and\nelsewhere): Some [Sanders supporters] are new to politics completely. They're\nchildren of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents'\nbasement. They feel that they got their education and the jobs that are\navailable to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they\ndon't see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials\ntoday and, you know, one of the young women said, \"You know, none of us feel\nthat we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don't\nbelieve the job market is going to give us much of a chance.\" So that is a\nmindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you're feeling like\nyou're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job\nthat doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity\nattached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a\npolitical revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we all should be really\nunderstanding of that and we should try to do the best we can not to be, you\nknow, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic….. To recap,\nthere's virtually nothing accurate in Alex Jones' statement purporting to\nquote Hillary Clinton and WikiLeaks. We've addressed an inquiry to InfoWars\nfor clarification, and await their reply.\n\n",

            "input": "Jul 1, 2017 at 3:15 PM The progressive strategy of investigating President\nDonald Trump nonstop for Russian collusion or obstruction of justice or\nwitness tampering so far has produced no substantial evidence of wrongdoing.\nThe alternate strategy of derailing the new administration before it really\ngets started hasn't succeeded either, despite serial efforts to sue over\nelection results, alter the Electoral College vote, boycott the inauguration,\ndelay the confirmation of appointments, demand recusals, promise Trump's\nimpeachment or removal through the 25th Amendment, and file suit under the\nEmoluments Clause. A third strategy of portraying Trump as a veritable monster\nlikewise so far has failed in four special elections for House seats.\nApparently progressives have accepted the idea that Barack Obama's formula of\ntwice winning the Electoral College is not yet transferable to other\nprogressive candidates such as Hillary Clinton. And they probably have\nconcluded that Obama's progressive political agenda proved unpopular with\nvoters by 2010 and had to be implemented by ad hoc executive orders --\npresidential prerogatives now utilized by Donald Trump to overturn the ones\nObama issued. A fourth potential pathway to power would be a return to Bill\nClinton's pragmatic agendas of the 1990s. But apparently progressives find\nthat centrist remedy worse than the malady of losing elections -- given that\nduring the Obama tenure, more than 1,000 state and local offices were lost to\nRepublicans, in addition to majorities in the House and Senate, and a majority\nof governorships and legislatures. What next? Trump acts as if he is a\nNietzschean figure, assuming that anything that does not destroy him only\nmakes him stronger. And now, slowly, his accusers are becoming the accused.\nOne nagging problem with the progressive case against Trump for purported\nRussian collusion and obstruction of justice was that members of the Obama\nadministration had more exposure to those allegations than did the political\nnewcomer Trump. Last year, then-FBI Director James Comey testified that not\nonly did former Attorney General Loretta Lynch improperly meet in secret with\nBill Clinton during an investigation of Hillary Clinton, but that Lynch had\nasked Comey to downplay the investigation into Hillary's use of a private\nemail server during her tenure as secretary of state. Comey confessed that he\nhad reluctantly agreed to Lynch's request. Last month, in testimony before the\nSenate Intelligence Committee, Comey admitted that he asked a friend to leak\nnotes about Comey's earlier conversation with Trump in hopes of forcing the\nnomination of a special investigator to lead the Russia investigation --\nperhaps a successful gambit, given that Comey's friend, former FBI Director\nRobert Mueller, was soon appointed to that role. Comey also wrongly dismissed\nHillary Clinton's email problems because of a perceived lack of criminal\nintent -- a supposedly mitigating circumstance that legally should have had no\nbearing on things. As far as alleged Russian collusion, there had long been\nconservative accusations that Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary's status\nas secretary of state to leverage honoraria for Bill and donations to the\nClinton Foundation in exchange for concessions to Russian interests. Moreover,\nRussian tampering efforts had been going on for months before the 2016\nelection, but without any retaliatory measures from the Obama administration,\nwhich knew about Russia's meddling. In an inadvertent hot-mic request in 2012,\nObama asked outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to urge Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin \"to give me space\" during Obama's re-election\ncampaign, so that after his assumed success, Obama could reciprocate with\n\"more flexibility\" on Russian issues. In the present highly charged climate,\nwould that be seen as a form of Russian collusion? Meanwhile, the House\nIntelligence Committee is still investigating whether top Obama administration\nofficials wrongfully used the power of foreign-intelligence collection to\nconduct surveillance of Americans -- particularly members of the Trump\ncampaign. The point is not whether the Clintons, James Comey, Barack Obama or\nmembers of the Obama administration can be proven to have engaged in illegal\nor unscrupulous behavior. Rather, the lesson is that progressives should have\noffered alternative political visions that might have won back the American\npeople rather than attempting to terminate the Trump presidency on charges to\nwhich the progressive side was far more vulnerable. Now that Trump is emerging\nfrom successful House special elections and has fended off six months of media\nattacks, celebrity invective and progressive efforts to abort his tenure, he\nseems to be going back on the offensive. Currently, House and Senate\ninvestigations are doing to Democrats what has been done Trump. So far these\nprobes seem to have better chances to prove alleged wrongdoing. What does all\nthis political back-and-forth mean? Democrats struck preemptively to take out\nTrump before he unwound the Obama legacy. That effort has probably been\nstalled. The return volley is being launched at a time when an energized Trump\nis gaining momentum on health care and tax reform, and an improving economy.\nIn sum, to thwart a new president's policies, it is probably wiser to offer\nalternative agendas instead of trying to destroy him before he has even\nentered office. Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the\nHoover Institution at Stanford University.\n\n",

Grassley pointed out that Christopher Steele, the British\nspy who compiled the garbage dossier acknowledged in a London court that he\nindeed shared the 35-page document with British intelligence agencies. Per the\n[Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2017/10/09/senate-committee-raises-new-\nquestions-about-the-trump-dossier/?utm_source=site-share): \"It is possible\nthat this political dossier's collusion allegations…may have also been\nsurreptitiously funneled into U.S. intelligence streams through foreign\nintelligence sharing,\" Grassley wrote in his letter to Wray. \"If so, that\nforeign information would likely have ended up within the FBI's investigation\nof allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russia.\" According to\nsome reports, foreign intelligence agencies have shared information with U.S.\ninvestigators that matches some of the allegations about collusion laid out in\nthe dossier. But Trump and members of his campaign named in the dossier have\ndenied the allegations. Grassley also said, \"it may not have been clear to the\nFBI that the foreign reporting was actually based on the work of Mr. Steele\nand Fusion GPS. If this in fact happened, it would be alarming.\" As previously\nreported, a third deadline passed for the FBI and Justice Department to hand\nover subpoenaed documents to the House Intelligence Committee relating to the\ndebunked Russian dossier on September 22nd. The big question is, did the FBI\nactually use this garbage dossier to obtain a FISA warrant like reports\nsuggest? The Obama FBI used a secret court order to wiretap Manafort. We the\npeople deserve to know if the debunked dossier was used to obtain this FISA\nwarrant in order to spy on Trump's camp. What we do know is that Comey cited\nthis dossier in some of his briefings: FBI Director James Comey has cited the\ndossier in some of his briefings with lawmakers in recent weeks as one of the\ninformation sources used by his bureau to bolster its probe, U.S. officials\nbriefed on the investigation told CNN. We also know that Fusion GPS, the\ncompany that commissioned the dossier is a Democrat oppo research firm. Via\nPaul Sperry of the [New York Post:](https://nypost.com/2017/06/24/inside-the-\nshadowy-intelligence-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier/) A secretive Washington\nfirm that commissioned the [dubious intelligence dossier on Donald\nTrump](https://nypost.com/2017/01/10/intel-chiefs-told-trump-that-russia-has-\ndirt-on-him-report/) is stonewalling congressional investigators trying to\nlearn more about its connections to the Democratic Party. Fusion GPS was on\nthe payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a\nlong-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump. In 2012, Democrats hired\nFusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And in\n2015, Democrat ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro-\nlife activists protesting the abortion group. One of the most outrageous\nunconfirmed allegations in the report claims the Russians recorded Trump\nwatching Russian prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room\npreviously occupied by President and Mrs. Barack Obama. And the liberal media\nand Secret Service and John McCain believed this nonsense? Now we learn Rep.\nNunes has issued subpoenas to the firm behind the discredit dossier.\n[Zerohedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-10-11/house-intelligence-\ncommittee-subpoenas-firm-behind-trump-dossier) reports:\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/10/politics/fusion-gps-subpoenas-devin-\nnunes/index.html) reports that Nunes earlier this month issued subpoenas to\nthe founders of Fusion GPS, the Washington opposition research firm that\noriginally helped procure the dossier, demanding that they participate in\npublic hearings before the House Intelligence Committee, and turn over all\npertinent documents. Earlier this year, Nunes announced that he was stepping\naside from directing the committee's Russia inquiry when he became the subject\nof an ethics investigation into his handling of classified information after\nhe informed the White House about the possibility that members of the Trump\ncampaign were legally surveilled during the race before informing his own\ncommittee. […] Nunes' Democratic colleagues have repeatedly accused Nunes of\ndeliberately trying to undermine the FBI's investigation by forcing the agency\nto reveal sensitive details about the dossier that the intelligence community\npreviously decided to withhold from the January report on the intelligence\ncommunity's finding that Russia had interfered with the election. Here is more\nbackground on the now-discredited Trump Dossier.

What will\nshe need luck for if she's not going to be president? Ten minutes earlier,\nTrump told moderator Chris Wallace he will let us all know on election night\nwhether he is going to accept the results of the Nov. 8 balloting. It was a\nshocking and cravenly irresponsible thing to say, the sort of thing that\nthreatens to rend our national fabric, and for that alone, Trump has earned\nhis place in the history of American ignominy. But who needs to wait?\nConsciously or not, the guy ceded the race. Live. On television. On Oct. 19.\nLotsa luck indeed. Hillary sure did luck out having him as her rival. She can\nbasically take the next three weeks off. But why would she? She can just spend\nthe time taking the most luxurious pre-victory lap in American history. Trump\nwill make that phone call on Nov. 8 or he won't, and he will or won't make\nthat speech in which he tells his supporters, \"I just congratulated Hillary on\nbecoming the next president and we must all come together.\" There's no\ntelling. This is a test of character, but Trump has a different understanding\nof such tests of character -- and he might believe he will only pass such a\ntest by doing what he can to continue to be the expression of the American\nid's rage and disappointment. His refusal to do so would be the mark of a\ntragic decline in our polity, as would the refusal of some significant numbers\nof his supporters to accept the results as well. But this is the story of\n2016. He refused to do other things as well -- like concede the fact that the\nRussian government is attempting to interfere with the election. Hillary\nClinton said three times that 17 different US military and intelligence\nagencies have determined that this is so. Due to his truly bizarre\nunwillingness to say anything really negative about Russia's dictator, Trump\njust said no to that -- and handed Hillary her sound bite of the night: \"He'd\nrather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and intelligence people who\nare sworn to protect us.\" How was the debate? Well, it was reasonably\nsubstantive, largely due to Chris Wallace's absolutely perfect work as the\nmoderator. And if you went moment by moment and point by point, you would\nprobably score it reasonably closely. Trump zinged her on several patent\ndishonesties, and as usual, she handled the zinging badly. On the other hand,\nevery time she needed a way out of a corner, she baited him with something --\nwomen he'd said bad things about, or the money he'd borrowed from his father\n-- and he'd fall for it every time. But let's face it: Do you really want me\nto tell you who I think won the exchange on entitlements? I mean, who cares?\nDoes it bother me that Hillary Clinton said she was going to apply a strict\nleft-liberal litmus test to her Supreme Court appointments? Yes, it does, but\nI knew that already, and if you follow the issue, so did you. Very few people\nare voting in this election on matters of conventional governmental policy. A\ngreat many will vote for the team they've long been signed up with, while\neverybody else will be voting against one of these two extremely unattractive\nand unpopular candidates. Trump just told us he knows she has more people\nvoting in her favor and he has more people voting against him. He just told\nHillary to measure the drapes. He can spend the rest of his life never\nconceding, and she's still going to be the 45th president of the United\nStates.\n\n",

He doesn't see us as full human beings.\"\nFor proof of her closing argument, Clinton turned to former Miss Universe\nAlicia Machado, who Trump publicly shamed in 1997 for gaining a little weight.\n\"He said to me, Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, Miss Eating Machine,\" Machado\nsaid, joining Clinton in Dade City. It's a closing argument aimed not just at\nfemale voters but also the men who love them.

This is a\nfalse choice. There are plenty of factors that went into Trump becoming the\npresumptive GOP nominee, and the incessant media coverage of his every\nutterance and movement probably contributed to his sky-high negatives. But\nit's unserious, not to mention smug, to assume that Trump has been playing all\nof his Republican supporters for dupes. You don't need to worship Trump to\nvote for him. You don't even have to like him, or think he's always honest,\nbecause these are not the factors at the heart of Trump's appeal. Consider\nthis from Michael Cooper, a writer, attorney, and liberal Democrat who lives\nin rural North Carolina. \"My Republican friends are for Trump. My state\nrepresentative is for Trump,\" he wrote in U.S. News in March. \"People who\nhaven't voted in years are for Trump. He'll win the primary here on March 15\nand he will carry this county in the general. His supporters realize he's a\njoke. They do not care. They know he's authoritarian, nationalist, almost un-\nAmerican, and they love him anyway, because he disrupts a broken political\nprocess and beats establishment candidates who've long ignored their\ninterests.\" This, I think, nicely sums up the core of Trump's support. Yes,\nthere is a cult of personality around the candidate, and some of his backers\ndo seem to think of him as a man who can do no wrong. But the breadth of\nTrump's support alone indicates that we're dealing with more than just full-\nfledged #TrumpTrain devotees. We're also dealing with the people Cooper writes\nabout, the ones who aren't so enthralled with the man himself but recognize\nhim as a change agent. And the truth is that a President Trump would, of\ncourse, be a change agent. A Hillary win would likely take us to something\nlike the pre-Trump status quo ante, which is one reason why so many D.C. and\nWall Street Republicans will wind up supporting her -- they'll still know how\nto play the game in a second Clinton presidency.  The notable Republicans who\naren't supporting Donald Trump A Trump victory, meanwhile, will undoubtedly\nlead to profound upheaval in our political system. The policies he'll pursue\nin office are still something of a mystery, but due to his lack of a real,\ngrounding political philosophy, we can assume that he'll embrace positions to\nboth the right- and left-of-center. In effect this would be something like a\nthird party in American politics, and one in control of the White House no\nless -- a Party of Trump, which will find itself at odds with both stalwart\nconservatives like Ben Sasse and progressives like Elizabeth Warren.\nOccasionally he'll find common cause with one side, and sometimes with the\nother. You could even see him putting together odd bedfellows like Sherrod\nBrown and Jeff Sessions to pass new restrictions on trade. Any way you look at\nit, he would scramble everything we know about American politics. You can\nargue that the changes that Trump would bring to this country would be\ndisastrous, or that he's morally and intellectually unfit for the office. But\nthe one safe bet we have about a Trump presidency is that it would provoke a\nrealignment in our politics and bring about an end to the elite governing\nconsensus of the last several decades. America's many establishments --\nRepublican and Democrat, liberal and conservative - would all suddenly find\nthemselves on the outs. The Democrats have signaled that they'll run on the\nidea that a Trump presidency is just too \"risky\" and \"dangerous.\" But that\nshows a real misunderstanding of his appeal as a candidate. The subtext of\nevery Trump rally is basically take this risk, take this gamble -- it may all\nend in tears, but it's worth a shot. America isn't working anymore, his\nargument goes. It's not working for Americans, Americans know that, and all\nthose smug elites are to blame. How do we fix that? Hard to say: Trump,\nremember, has a habit of contradicting himself within the same sentence when\nanswering questions about his policy specifics. But step one is blowing up the\nsystem, and that's exactly what Trump is promising to do. Is it childish to\nwant the political system to be completely upended even if the consequences\nmight be disastrous? Maybe. But in a country where a plurality of Americans\nthink that \"people like them\" were better off 50 years ago, at least according\nto a recent Pew survey, it should also be expected. We can dismiss Trump's\nvoters as low-class, knuckle-dragging racists who deserve, in some sense, to\nsuffer. But that wouldn't be wise from a governing standpoint or, for Trump's\nopponents, a tactical one. If you think that Trump's voters don't get what's\nbest for them, then it's up to you to sell them on why they're wrong -- to\nmake the case that free trade leads to cheaper, better goods for everyone,\nthat immigration greatly benefits the economy, that a \"Muslim ban\" is immoral\nand would only help groups like ISIS. That the system, for all its faults, can\nstill be reformed, and that allowing Trump to raise hell in Washington will\nonly make his supporters' lot worse. But to just dismiss them as \"idiots\" is,\nwell, stupid. It plays into his hands; it justifies the anti-elite impulse\nhe's exploited. The consensus among all the poll-watchers and data-heads who\nhave consistently underestimated Trump from the onset is that Hillary is all\nbut certain to win in November. And they might be right. But if Trump pulls\noff the upset, the smugness and lack of empathy that defines too many of his\ndetractors will be in large part to blame.\n\n",

Just how does a Shah go about\ntackling the task that has eluded generations of people worldwide? By throwing\na politically incorrect party, of course! Reza and [Mike\nShouhed](http://realitytea.com/tag/mike-shouhed/) nurse their hangovers at\nlunch, while they recover from Shervin Rpoohparvar's Malibu party the night\nbefore. Mike never went to bed and when Mercedes \"MJ\" Javid shows up, it looks\nlike she hasn't either….for days. Talk turns from being hungover to how much\nMike's family means to him and that includes family in Israel that he hasn't\nseen in over ten years. Hey, wouldn't it be \"the dope-est\" if all of the Shahs\nwent to Israel too? Apparently so, according to Reza. He is looking to connect\nwith the Jewish side of his life via a posh vacation with his friends. When\nthey try and get MJ on board, she initially balks, saying she doesn't want to\nleave her father while he is sick. But she quickly realizes that she needs a\nbreak from her stressful life and I guess another cast trip with this bunch of\nhooligans is something she might find relaxing. She thrives in chaos after\nall! shahs-of-sunset-recap (3) A very pregnant Asa Soltan Rahmati takes a\nbreak from talking about her pregnancy to go kaftan boutique hunting with her\nfamily. Just kidding, she is still talking about it, saying that her family\nbusiness is even more important now that there is another family member on the\nway. And everyone knows you can only sell kaftans out of a non-working\nrefrigerator for so long before you have to upgrade to a ramshackled store\nfront, which is exactly what Asa is doing. The landlord (and old friend of\nAsa's) shows up in his landlord-y best, which includes a sundress, pink\ntights, rainbow wig, and nipple eyelashes, that he immediately shows off to\neveryone. Is this included in the rent? Never mind that, Asa has some sage to\nburn and twirls of happiness to make around the space so that it is cleansed\nand ready to sell kaftans. GG and thousands of her hair extensions are putting\ngood things out in the universe and you know what that means - good things are\ncoming back. Things like walking in a tacky sequined romper down a runway for\nsome designer no one has ever heard of, I guess? Clearly, she must be friends\nwith this designer and clearly, there is a shortage of eligible models for\nfashion week in L.A. because why else would someone risk having their clothes\nripped off incredible hulk style, mid-catwalk if something doesn't go\nLochnessa's way? I guess only time (and one fashion show) will tell. Reza is\nshopping for his \"Gaza Strip, Israeli, Palestine, Peace in the Middle East\"\nparty and guys, I cannot stress for the life of me the importance of\nquotations in this recap. These are Reza's words, not mine. With that\ndisclaimer out of the way, back to culturally insensitive shopping, y'all!\nDestiney, who is off the People's Couch and a supporting cast member now,\nshows up to help with the decorations. If this is anything like Mike's party,\nReza should know this isn't a good idea but then again, Reza isn't known for\nbeing classy when it comes to decor. He also isn't known for being culturally\nsensitive but he explains that being a refugee from a war-torn country, where\nyou can be hung for being gay, leaves him with a desire to poke fun at it as a\nway of coping with his feelings. He invites Destiney to the Israel trip since\nhusband Adam Neely can't come due to better judgment work. Destiney also likes\n\"dope\" things and taking a trip to Israel is one of them, so she happily\naccepts. shahs-of-sunset-recap (5) MJ, despite not being married, has some\nmarital advice for all of us: you must date your husband until the day you\ndie. I have some marital advice for MJ: you must marry a man for him to\nqualify as your husband. But my advice aside, MJ saying date nights are about\nromance and making sure your man knows that you still want to have sex. And\nhow does one send up a smoke signal that you want to have a baby with said\nman? If you're MJ, you simply tell him \"eff it, I want to get ovulation strip\nand get pregnant.\" If you're fiance Tommy Feight, your response is something\nalong the lines of surprise, then a brief mention of being more responsible\nadults before bringing a child into this world, then saying let's go for it.\nMJ reasons that Salma Hayek and Halle Berry did it, so why can't she? I don't\nhave the answer to that but my guess would be that neither Salma nor Halle\nlived in a dirty, one bedroom apartment with no running water. That certainly\nwouldn't preclude you from having a baby but it might make child rearing a\nlittle easier, don't you think? With a big bite into a Korean BBQ rib, Tommy\nsays he's in and vows to stop and get ovulation test strips on the way home.\nAt L.A. Fashion Week, GG (not to be confused with Gigi, an actual supermodel),\nhas arrived to the show and is already swigging champagne and ordering around\nhair and makeup like she's been a horrible person all her life. Oh, wait…she\nhas! Shervin comes to support her but can't manage to even have a\nconversation, thanks to all the naked models in the room. Within minutes of\narriving, GG's mood gets darker than her raccoon eye makeup after seeing\nJanice Dickinson, one of the world's first supermodels, wearing the tacky\nsequined romper SHE was supposed to be wearing! GG is about to throw some\nmurderous vibes into the universe and snaps at the designer to get \"that old\na** b**ch another outfit\". Reza and Adam arrive just in time to see this and\nobviously, can't get enough. Shervin is oblivious because, boobs. Finally, GG\ntakes a deep breath and says \"fine\" to another equally ugly sequined outfit\nand the team puts the finishing touches to her glamorous roadkill look. shahs-\nof-sunset-recap (6) With Lochnessa contained, Reza decides to invite Shervin\non their trip to Israel and Shervin takes a pass, saying it would negatively\naffect some of his business relationships. Reza is confused and doesn't\nunderstand why everyone just can't join him in feeling \"Jew-y,\" while GG can't\nunderstand why she would want to go somewhere where they want to bomb\nPalestinians. Reza waives off her statement and a symbolic champagne bottle\npops loudly in the background, startling them all. Reza is still trying to get\neveryone on board and thinks exclaiming \"eff Iran\" out of frustration will do\nit. GG is offended but doesn't really have time to discuss it further since\nshe has a catwalk to go trip down. MJ has escalated pretty quickly on the baby\nfever scale and is already making Tommy pinky swear he won't masturbate\nanymore. Her plan is to get knocked up and then have a legal wedding ceremony\nso her babies won't be \"bastards.\" Oh MJ, if only anyone could take your\nidiotic morals to heart, but it's so hard when you can't even figure out how\nan ovulation test works. I know, it's hard to read directions and pee on\nsomething without your fiance standing over you to help, but I promise, it's\nnot nearly as hard as taking care of a baby, married or not. Maybe Salma and\nHalle are just better at reading directions. Despite almost clawing Janice\nDickinson's face off at the fashion show, GG is transitioning to a calmer,\nhappier person and that means clearing the toxic energy out of her life. Or,\nwhat normal people would call, moving. Shervin and Annalise come over to help\nand thankfully, there are no naked models in the room so Shervin can remain\nfocused. They quickly find out that GG isn't just harboring toxic energy in\nher apartment but boxes of old blow up donuts she used to sit on after her\nbutt implant surgery. Mike arrives and it turns out, his moving company is in\ncharge of moving all the furniture and butt donut boxes. Yes, Mike opened a\nmoving company and he says it's not sexy but it's a solid investment in a\nbusiness because you can't replace movers with robots. I didn't know you could\nreplace shoes with robots either so not sure why that business got tossed\naside but whatever. Mike doesn't even bother to wear his own shoe line to help\nmove and is quickly complaining about scuffing up his new Adidas. Shahs of\nSunset Recap The night of Reza's big party and everyone is going all out in\ncostume. MJ gets ready eating fried rice in her bathroom while getting her\nmakeup done. At the party house, Reza and Adam arrive, dressed in full\nOrthodox Rabbi costumes. Reza muses that since he is more in tune with the\nJewish side of his religion, he hopes he can wear the outfit without being\ndisrespectful. In his next breath, he is showing off his \"sexy burqa bitches,\"\nwho are there to entertain and serve the party goers in headscarves and\nsequined bikinis. Mike arrives as Moses, Asa arrives as…pregnant, but claims\nshe is world peace, simply because she draped a white scarf that's painted\nwith a peace sign around her stomach. MJ is in a skin tight skeleton costume\nwith side boob and Shervin comes in an orange suit, saying he's an immigrant\nfrom the seventies. GG arrives in a full burqa and dark sunglasses, all which\nmake it impossible for her to get drunk quickly. GG still isn't sold on going\nto Israel and when Reza asks, Shervin also expresses concerns about being\nwelcomed. Mike promises that Israel is very accepting, but GG pushes back\nagain, saying they are not of Muslims. It starts to get a little heated but\nGG's real issue is Reza's comment to \"eff Iran.\" In a surprising twist, Reza\nimmediately apologizes, explaining that he loves everything about Iran but the\ngovernment. Asa tries to bring resolution to the conversation by reminding\neveryone how important it is that they respect each other's journey. That's\nenough for GG to fully get on board and agree to go to Israel so she\ncelebrates by grinding on Mike, proving that all you need is love and a little\ndry humping to make the world a better place.

Criticism\nrained down on the former San Francisco 49ers Quarterback for his actions, but\nhe also won support aplenty from fellow athletes and onlookers for his social\njustice stance. The 29-year-old is currently unemployed because of his\nactions, however, and NFL clubs are reluctant to touch him because of the\npublicity that his protests attract.

For too long, we\nhave wasted precious time and money worshipping these so-called \"social\njustice\" warrior hypocrites who continue to disappoint. Here's to hoping all\nthis disappointment will lead us back to what really matters, but don't count\non it. Huge swaths of Americans still bow at the altar of social justice. They\nbelieve government-forced \"charity\" will advance us to an utopian paradise\nwhere everyone enjoys the same outcome, despite personal effort, upbringing,\nunique abilities and education. Truth is, though, social justice is an\noxymoron based on the false premise that the cure for injustice is leveling\nthe playing field and redistributing wealth. As former Vice President Joe\nBiden once said, \"You may call it redistribution of wealth a€' I just call it\nbeing fair.\" Karl Marx would be so proud. Marx hated religion, private\nproperty and Judeo-Christian values as much as leftists do today. That's why\nyou should bolt out of any place of worship that combines Jesus, social\njustice and the government in the same sentence. In his book, \"The Fatal\nConceit: The Errors of Socialism,\" economist Friedrich Hayek nails what's\nreally at stake: \"The aim of socialism is no less than to affect a complete\nredesigning of our traditional morals, law and language a€' and on this basis\nto stamp out the old order and the supposedly inexorable, unjustifiable\nconditions that prevent the institution of reason, fulfillment, true freedom\nand justice.\" Yesteryears' creepy social justice warriors are now out of the\ncloset and no longer hide their agenda. Instead, they give it a pink boa and\nparade their intentions to destroy capitalism, silence free speech and scrub\nJudeo-Christian values from the public square. They harp about injustice and\nclaim only they can fix it, which is one of the most arrogant, egotistical\npiles of hogwash you'll ever hear. All that, while they divide us into two\ngroups, normal folks and them. They believe normal folks are about as smart as\nslugs, therefore incapable of coherent reasoning and self-care. To them,\neveryday Americans aren't diamonds in the rough, they are pliable, moldable\nobjects used to reshape America into a socialist nightmare like Venezuela. As\nI've said before, Democrats' sacrosanct belief that the government was created\nto control how fairness is spread around is nothing more than a modern-day\neffort to reinvent Robin Hood, without all the chivalry and green tights.\nThose who romantically embrace the concept of social justice believe the\nmisnomer that stealing from some and passing it on to those who should have\nhad it in the first place will result in some sort of righteous leveling.\nLeftists don't own the market on charity. Normal folks leave government out of\nthe mix and combine their compassion with common sense. They bring food in one\nhand and a rifle in the other, knowing if they teach someone how to hunt,\nthey'll eat for a lifetime. In comparison, leftists bring Trader Joe's bagels\nin one hand and a voter's registration card in the other. Seizing the\nopportunity to convert their victims into non-thinking entitlement\naficionados, they stop at nothing to meet an immediate need, then lead them by\ntheir noses to leftist-run metropolises where crime and government handouts\nabound. I know, the devil is always in the details, but I'll go ahead and say\nit anyhow. Forced \"charity\" doesn't bring about justice. Instead, it creates\ninjustice when it stirs up animosity between the less fortunate and those\nbeing penalized, taxed, for their hard work under penalty of prosecution. In\nsharp contrast, there is a power in authentic generosity that no amount of\ngovernment social-engineering could or will ever match. The social justice\ncrowd should dust off the knees they protest with and try it sometime. ^ Susan\nStamper Brown lives in Alaska and writes on culture, politics and current\nevents.\n\n",

But the most\nvivid and obvious evidence that Trump is becoming even more unbalanced even\nthan before (which is saying something) comes from his Twitter feed, which has\nbeen a daily dumpster fire ever since word came down that Michael Flynn had\napparently made a deal with Robert Mueller. [Trump's\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\nis a window into his mind, and right now it isn't offering an attractive view.\nHe's madly tweeted lies about his tax plan, applauded himself for single-\nhandedly causing the stock market to rise, insulted the media, slandered old\nfriends and condemned some of the famous men who have been fired for sexual\nharassment. Apparently he is more assured of his omnipotence than ever, since\nhe was rewarded with the presidency while all those other guys have been\nbrought low. He's put on quite a show and all of it has further degraded the\npresidency and embarrassed the nation before the world. But there was one\nseries of tweets that stood out and it's so bad that it may have actually\ncaused a diplomatic break with our closest ally. On Thursday morning, for some\ninexplicable reason, the president of the United States retweeted three videos\nclaiming to be Muslim extremists perpetrating violence. One purported to show\na group of Muslims pushing a boy off a roof, another claimed to show a Muslim\ndestroying a statue of the Virgin Mary and a third supposedly showed a Muslim\nimmigrant hitting a Dutch boy on crutches. The Dutch embassy clarified that\nthe third video actually of two native-born dutch boys fighting, and did not\ninvolve Muslim immigrants at all. The tweets were from a vile British\nneofascist named Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of a tiny far-right, anti-\nimmigrant group called Britain First. You may recall that prior to the Brexit\nvote last year a Labour Party member of Parliament named Jo Cox was\nassassinated by a man who shouted the words \"Britain First\" before he killed\nher. [According to the Daily Beast:](https://www.thedailybeast.com/fascist-\nevil-racist-uk-parliament-unloads-on-trumps-twitter-outburst) The group had\npreviously struggled to garner mainstream-media coverage of their video\nstunts, which include mosque \"invasions\" and \"Christian patrols\" during which\nuniformed thugs carrying white crosses attempt to intimidate minority\ncitizens. On Wednesday, Trump catapulted Fransen and the group's leader Paul\nGolding, who is also a convicted criminal, into the global conversation. Trump\nsent those videos out to his millions of followers; hundreds of millions more\nmay have seen them through other social media and mainstream news by now.\nThese anti-Muslim videos are the worst kind of hate propaganda, the kind of\nthing one expects to find deep in the bowels of the extremist right-wing\ninternet. Needless to say, Fransen was delighted and [thanked\nTrump](https://twitter.com/JaydaBF/status/935842051991711745)for \"sharing the\nvideos with his \"44 MILLION FOLLOWERS! GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP! GOD BLESS\nAMERICA!\" The reaction was swift. Prime Minister Theresa May's office [rebuked\nthe president](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-twitter-may/trump-\nwas-wrong-to-retweet-uk-far-right-group-british-pm-mays-spokesman-\nidUSKBN1DT2IS) in a statement which said that Britain First \"divides\ncommunities in their use of hateful narratives which pedal lies and stoke\ntensions. This causes anxieties to law-abiding people. The British people\noverwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right, which is the\nantithesis of the values that this country represents; decency, tolerance and\nrespect. It is wrong for the President to have done this.\" Trump himself was\nnot contrite, of course. He responded this way: .\n[@Theresa_May](https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), don't\nfocus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking\nplace within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! -- Donald J. Trump\n(@realDonaldTrump) [November 30,\n2017](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/936037588372283392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nThe British Parliament did not take this well. In speech after speech members\ndemanded that Trump's invitation for a state visit (already controversial) be\nrescinded. Labor M.P. Stephen Doughty declared that by sharing those tweets,\nTrump had shown himself to be \"either a racist, incompetent or unthinking --\nor all three. I love America, it is a country and people of extraordinary\ngenerosity, courage, kindness and humanity -- but this president represents\nnone of those things.\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan\n[said](https://www.thedailybeast.com/fascist-evil-racist-uk-parliament-\nunloads-on-trumps-twitter-outburst) May should use \"any influence she and her\ngovernment claim to have with the president\" to ask that he \"delete these\ntweets and to apologize to the British people.\" None of that is going to\nhappen, of course. [Trump's state of\nmind](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-tells-confidants-that-a-\ngovernment-shutdown-might-be-good-for-\nhim/2017/11/30/e5328328-d5f5-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html?utm_term=.84accadad838)\nat the moment is that following his racist instincts are what got him to the\nmost powerful office on earth and following those instincts is the winning\nformula going forward. We are all well aware of Trump's bond with the old-\nfashioned American far right. David Duke is a big fan and [applauded\nhim](https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/935898511756886016) for retweeting\nthe videos. Trump thinks that one can be a \"very fine person\" and still carry\na torch and march with Nazis shouting \"Jews will not replace us\" in American\ncities. His xenophobic rhetoric toward Mexicans and Muslims, and his barely\nconcealed racism, have been obvious for years and were major selling points\nduring his campaign. Trump has also shown an affinity for the neofascist right\nin Europe, perhaps under the influence of Steve Bannon, who has developed\nalliances with such groups for some time through his [Breitbart International\nmedia venture](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-\nfinance/21711265-readership-surging-stephen-bannons-alt-right-news-outfit-\nabout-launch-french-and). White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nsaid later that Trump did not know who Jayda Fransen was before he retweeted\nher, and claimed he was trying to [\"elevate the\nissue\"](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/936332380100587521) of extremist\nviolence in Europe. That's not enough. [He has been retweeting white\nsupremacists and neofascists for a long time](http://fortune.com/donald-trump-\nwhite-supremacist-genocide/). Quite likely he doesn't know who they all are\neither, but he obviously likes what they have to say and he's happy to use his\nplatform of tens of millions of followers and the prestige of the White House\nto spread their message far and wide. May did not rescind the invitation to\nthe state visit. But the British don't seem to be in any hurry to set a date\neither. Plans for a \"working visit\" from Trump in January [have been\ndropped](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-working-visit-uk-\njanuary-2018-cancelled-report-2017-11?op=1), which seems wise. Our president\nseems to have done something that nobody else has been able to do in Britain\nlately: He brought left and right together -- in mutual loathing for him. Over\nthe Thanksgiving holiday Trump made [a weird, cryptic\ncomment](https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/933720334070673408) to Coast\nGuard troops, saying, \"You never know about an ally, an ally can turn, you're\ngoing to find that out.\" Maybe he was talking about himself.\n\n",

            "input": "Quick: what is the appropriate response to the stabbing death of a human? And\nlet's just never mind the fact that the stabbing was [completely random and\nunprovoked](http://www.theroot.com/alt-reich-nation-member-charged-with-\nmurder-in-stabbing-1795420915). Or that the victim just happened to be days\naway from graduating from Bowie State University and had recently been\ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was preparing to move\nto Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for training in defending the country against\nchemical attacks. What is important here, since it seems to be the only thing\nthat is ever important in these situations, is that the victim - Richard\nCollins III, 23 - was Black. His murderer, Christopher Urbanski, 22, who saw\nfit to plunge a knife into Collins's chest for reasons [no one apparently\nknows](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/black-student-stabbed-\nmaryland.html?_r=0) but the FBI is investigating as a \"possible\" (possible!!!)\nhate crime, is white. [ Save Yes, \"possible.\" As a matter of fact, Urbanski,\nwho was charged with assault and first- and second-degree murder and is being\nheld without bail, is a member of the white supremacist Facebook group Alt-\nReich: Nation, according to ](http://heavy.com/news/2017/05/richard-collins-\niii-alt-reich-facebook-photos-sean-urbanski-university-of-maryland-stabbing-\nvictim-hate-crime/)[NBC 4\nWashington](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/NATL-DCFamily-Identifies-\nBowie-State-Univ-Student-Stabbed-Killed-at-UMd-423505764.html). So yes, it is\nfair to say that it is certainly \"possible\" this was a hate crime. Ah, but the\nstory doesn't end there, because why would it. After Collins died, a civilian\nemployee of the Anne Arundel County Police Department in Maryland [took to\nsocial media to praise the act](http://www.theroot.com/radical-extremist-\ndiscovered-working-in-police-departme-1795481640). Welby Burgone, a police-\nacademy recruit and obvious national treasure in Trump's America, worked in\nthe Anne Arundel County Police Department's communications department as a\ncivilian employee. He was also a classmate and presumable \"boy\" of Urbanski's.\nWhen one Matt Worth posted on Twitter: \"Fuck Yeah Sean!!!! That's what happens\nwhen n***as try and get frosty with an OG. Talk shit, stabbed, lol.\" To which\nBurgone replied with a meme that he apparently found funny, even though it\nobjectively isn't funny under ANY circumstances, and certainly not when it\nrefers to the slaying of a fellow human being. [ Save Thankfully, because\nsometimes the world isn't a completely awful place, the Anne Arundel Police\nDepartment also didn't find it funny and immediately suspended Burgone,\nissuing the following ](http://www.theroot.com/radical-extremist-discovered-\nworking-in-police-\ndepartme-1795481640)[statement](http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/for_the_record/ph-\nac-cn-police-post-0523-20170522-story.html): \"The actions of this employee are\na betrayal of the values of the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Any\nemployee who espouses or supports hateful or racist ideology will be held\naccountable and we will not allow the public's trust in their police\ndepartment to be eroded.\" This person is, however, still alive and freely\nroaming the streets being a good ol' 'Murican and contributing to the\n\"dialogue\" on his possible pro-hate crime radical extremist white supremacist\ngroup, and will go on to find employment elsewhere and ban together with like-\nminded fragile white men and possibly even reproduce and indoctrinate his\nprogeny into his viciously racist ideology, all the while hiding behind his\nGod and guns, so, awesome. Honestly it's hard to say what the most disturbing\npart of this story even is.\n\n",

            "input": "Iran and Russia plan to destroy Western Europe, the US, and Canada by means of\na new wave of millions of Syrian Sunnis fleeing to the West to escape the\nShiite takeover of Syria. In my weekly column two months ago, I claimed that\nIran is the real victor in the Syrian civil war. Using the war against ISIS as\na smokescreen, it is taking over large swathes of Syrian territory, mainly in\nthe scarcely populated middle and eastern parts of the country. In the more\nfertile and densely populated west of Syria, there are Iraqi, Afghan, and\nIranian Shiite militias augmenting Lebanese Hezbollah fighters who were given\ncarte blanche to do whatever Hassan Nasrallah decides to do there. Assad's\nstrength continues to increase as ISIS and the other rebel forces lose ground.\nThe brutality of Russian involvement and the cruelty of Shiite militias\novercame the anti-Assad forces, the turning point occurs when in 2015, Turkey'\ns Erdogan was forced by Russia to cease his aid to the rebels and ISIS. Today,\nalthough Erdogan is an unwilling ally of Russia, Alawite Assad still sees him,\njustifiably, as an Islamist enemy. The Kurds of northeast Syria, treated as\nbelow third class citizens until 2011, will never agree to live under Arab\nmercy once again and it is reasonable to assume that should Syria remain an\nundivided country under Assad's rule, the Kurds will preserve relative\nautonomy in their region - or fight the regime for their rights. That is\ncertainly a problem, but the main issue facing a united Syria is going to be\nthe drastic demographic changes the country is going to face.  First of all,\nabout half of Syria's citizens - close to 10 million - are refugees, half\nlocated in Syria and the other half in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, other Arab\ncountries, Europe, North and South America, Australia and even Israel. Syrian\nrefugees who reached points outside the Arab world will in all probability\nstay put, benefitting from the secure and orderly lives they can now lead. On\nthe other hand, the 3.5 million now in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey are\nawaiting the end of hostilities in order to return to their homes. Those\nexpectations may be dashed, however, because Syrian reality is totally\nchanged, and large parts of its cities are in ruins after six and a half years\nof a cruel and bloody war. Countless bombs dropped from planes and\nhelicopters, artillery and tank barrages, mines, and explosives planted by\nboth sides have made much of urban Syria, where most of the fighting took\nplace, unsafe to live in. In Homs, Aleppo, Adlib, Hamat and many other cities,\nentire neighborhoods will have to be razed and their infrastructure rebuilt\nfrom scratch. Decades and billions of dollars are needed to rebuild the\ncountry and I, for one, do not see the world's nations standing in line to\ndonate the necessary funds. Refugees will not agree to switch their tents in\nJordan for ruined buildings lacking basic infrastructure in a desolate and\ndestroyed Syria. The other reason the refugees will not return is their\njustified fear of the new lords of the land - the Shiites. Iran has been\nmoving Shiites from Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan to Syria for a long time in a\nclear attempt to change the demographic makeup of the country from the Sunni\nmajority it had before the civil war broke out in 2011. The issue could not be\nmore clear because it is no secret that the pre-civil war Sunni majority\nconsidered the Alawite ruler's heretic idol worshippers who had no right to\nlive in Syria, much less rule over it. The Alawites know well that the Sunnis\nrebelled against them twice: The first time was from 1976 to 1982, a rebellion\nthat took the lives of 50,000 citizens. The second time, slowly drawing to an\nend, has cost the lives of half a million men, women, children and aged\ncitizens of Syria. The Alawites intend to prevent a third rebellion and the\nbest way to do that is to change the majority of the population to Shiites\ninstead of Sunnis. They will not allow the Sunni refugees to return to their\nhomes, leaving them eternal refugees whose lands have been taken over by the\nenemy. Iran, meanwhile, will populate Syria with Shiites from Iraq, Iran, and\nAfghanistan. This ethnic cleansing is the Ayatollah's dream come true, the\ndream that sees a Shiite crescent drawn from Iran through Iraq and Syria to\nLebanon and the Mediterranean Sea. This will cover the eastern Arab world from\nthe north, while the war in Yemen is being fought in order to create a\nparallel southern crescent, entrapping Saudi Arabia and Jordan between the\ntwo. With the help of Allah, both those countries and Israel, the Small Satan,\nwill soon fall into the hands of the Shiites, while Europe and America do\nnothing because who cares when Muslims fight other Muslims? [ The Shiite\nmajority in Syria will play along with Lebanon's Hezbollah, their natural\nallies, and it is possible that some form of federation might be created\nbetween the two in order to push the Lebanese Christians out of the picture,\n\"persuading\" them to flee to other countries, leaving Lebanon to its\n\"rightful\" Shiite masters. This explains Nasrallah's eager willingness to\nfight on Syrian soil as well as the opposition of those against Nasrallah to\nhis involvement there. The new demographic situation in Syria will convince\nthe Sunni refugees that they have no place to which to return. They will try\ntheir best to be allowed to leave Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey for any country,\npreferably North America and Europe, willing to allow them entry. I predict a\nprocess that is the exact opposite of the one the world expects to take place\nwhen \"peace\" breaks out in Syria: Instead of refugees returning to their\nbirthplace, expect the mass flight of Sunni refugees from the region, and\nexpect a heightened incidence of Islamist terror in the countries that allow\nthem in. The reasons are obvious: 1. Former ISIS and rebel forces will\ninfiltrate along with the refugees, because they, too, are Sunni. They are\nfilled with fury and hatred for the Western countries who were part of the\ncoalition that fought ISIS or stood by without aiding the rebels. Some of them\nwill continue their Jihad on European and North American soil. Expect\nshootings, explosives and ramming attacks against citizens of these countries.\n2. Some of the refugees will not find work and live on the economic and social\nfringes of society, in poverty-stricken Islamist neighborhoods which have\nalready existed for years in many European cities, and where the local police\nfear to tread. Poverty and life on the fringe of society will turn some of the\nMuslim young people into easy prey for terrorist organization recruiters who\narouse the desire for Jihad by describing the accepting host countries as\ndecadent societies infected with permissiveness, prostitution, alcohol, drugs,\nmaterialism, and corruption. They present the countries that allowed the\nimmigrants entry as having done so to take advantage of them as industrial\nslaves, garage hands, cashiers and other degrading occupations, while the\nprivileged citizens are lawyers, accountant, businessmen, and homeowners who\ntake advantage of the migrants in humiliating ways. It is only a matter of\ntime until young Muslims, especially those who were taught that \"everyone is\nequal\" in Western schools, enlist in terrorist organizations. 3. Countries\nwhich allow in refugees will suffer a higher crime rate as a result, including\nviolence in public places, sexual attacks, and harassment, housebreaking, car\ntheft, substance abuse, unreported work to avoid paying taxes and illegal\nconstruction. This will all occur at the same time these countries expend a\nlarger part of their budgets on social services for the refugees, from child\nallowances to unemployment, health and old age benefits. At this point in\ntime, the percentage of second and third generation immigrants populating the\nprisons in Western Europe is significantly larger than their percentage in the\ngeneral population. 4. Increased economic, social and security problems in\nEurope and North America as a result of the rise in the number of migrants\nwill lead to a rise in the strength of the right and the extreme right. This\nwill, in turn, lead to more social tensions in the West. Members of Parliament\nwhose only wish is to be re-elected will adapt their parliamentary activity -\nespecially the laws they promote - to the expectations of the rapidly\nIslamizing constituencies, sacrificing their own people's interests on the\naltar of their political careers. Many Europeans, aware of their elected\nleaders' betrayal, will despair and leave those socially and economically\ndeteriorating countries. This will increase the rate at which Europe turns\ninto an Islamic region. And that is how the agreements Iran and Russia will\nsoon coerce Syria into accepting are going to start a chain reaction\nincreasing the number of refugees and pulling Europe down to a point of no\nreturn, without the world understanding what is going on. The Atlantic Ocean\nis not wide enough to protect North America from this debacle crossing the\nsea. This is how the Iranian Ayatollahs intend to destroy the heretic,\npermissive, drunk and materialistic West. More of the unfortunate Syrian\nmillions will find themselves exiled to the heretic countries hated by the\nAyatollahs, and Iran will operate from Syrian soil to vanquish Europe and\nAmerica.

            "input": "Most of the country condemned Kathy Griffin's now-infamous photo shoot holding\na fake severed head of President Trump. The shocking photo shoot prompted a\nnationwide outrage and sparked debate over whether or not Griffin should be\ninvestigated as a threat to national security. As the Trump family reacted to\nthe photo, it was reported that President Trump's youngest child--11-year-old\nBarron--had seen the photo while watching the news and became understandably\nupset. The one thing these so-called artists fail to take into account is the\nimpact their message will have on family members of their targets. It's\nincredibly hard to believe that creating images of this violent nature\nwouldn't provoke thought into how they will affect families or even the\naudience. Not only was Griffin's photo shoot and full admission of wrongdoing\ncompletely unacceptable by anyone's standards, it was disrespectful to victims\nof terrorism and their families. Radical Islamic terrorists are notorious for\nbeheading innocent people--including Americans--for propaganda videos. By far,\nthe most disgusting social media post came from some guy who apparently won\nbig on Jeopardy over ten years ago. Ken Jennings took to Twitter and decided\nto campaign for Dirtbag of the Year. \"Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on\na heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad and his\nlittle heart is breaking,\" the game show winner from 2004 posted on his\nTwitter account. He even defended Griffin's actions, citing--you guessed it--\nanother game show from the '90s where he said Griffin was known for holding up\nsevered heads. Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli\nmeat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad &amp; his little heart is\nbreaking -- Ken Jennings (@KenJennings) [May 31,\n2017](https://twitter.com/KenJennings/status/869982330743513089) This kind of\nreaction is absolutely reprehensible, especially under the circumstances. CNN\nhas since announced that Kathy Griffin has been fired from her job as a New\nYear's Eve announcer for the network alongside Anderson Cooper, who also\nexpressed outrage over the violent photo. With serious reactions to the photo\ntaking place in the United States, opportunists usually crawl out of the\nwoodwork to make a sad attempt at humor. This was a huge fail. Attacking a\nchild who was understandably disturbed by the gruesome image of his father's\nmock beheading is a new low in our society. Adding to this creep's sentiment,\nRosie O'Donnell weighed in via her Twitter account, dismissing Barron Trump's\nreaction by asking, \"Do you think he saw anything about these 2 heroic men who\ndied defending young girls? Hatred promoted by his father?\"This was in\nreference to the two men who were killed in Oregon defending a Muslim girl\nfrom an attack. Regarding which, by the way, President Trump released a\nstatement condemning the act as hatred that has no place in the United States.\nIt seems like reactions to disturbing incidents like the Kathy Griffin photo\nexpose the true nature of individuals and separate those with compassion for\nhumans--regardless of political belief--from truly heinous people.\n\n",
