    "Definition": "You are given a passage. You need to construct a question about the information present in the passage. Construct a question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) its answer is the whole paragraph. Avoid creating questions that can be answered correctly without actually understanding the paragraph.",
    "Positive Examples": [

            "input": "Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",
            "output": "why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass\ntable?",
            "explanation": "The passage talks about the glass and mirror surfaces beneath the optical mice and how the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. The last line of the passage explains why the mouse will not work properly on these surfaces. Thus it is a positive example."

Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for \"fit\" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.).

This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \"Self Reliance,\" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the \"independence of solitude\"). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a \"finished man\" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced \"perfect sweetness\" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \\nWhat do you think?",

It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \\nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.

There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory.",

There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics.",

Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \\n\\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \\n\\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\\n\\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\\n\\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \\n\\n\\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \\n\\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\\n\\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all.\" \\n\\n",

During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \\nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out” to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. \\nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.",

Next she turned professional and began touring the country, exhibiting her prowess in track, swimming, tennis, baseball, and even billiards. In 1935 Zaharias took up golf and excelled at that, too, winning 82 tournaments in a 20-year career. She was only 42 when she died of cancer in 1956.\"",

There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.

However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\\n\\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\\n\\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\\n\\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now \"secure enough\" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or \"encrypt\" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\\n\\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!",

I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region.  Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program.\\n\\nI agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it.  Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student.  I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student.  It opens a lot of doors.  But you need to be very goal directed to get this value.\\n\\nI can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good.  As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now.  Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks.\\n\\nSo - to your actual question.  If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously).  Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program.

As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead.

Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\\n\\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\\n\\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.  The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming.  Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.\\n\\nIt's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself.  Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\\n\\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\\n\\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\\n\\nwhere N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year.  \\n\\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\\n\\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\\n\\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year.",

I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him.  \\n\\nOnline dating is just another way to meet people, but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people.  If you're banking on it working, it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience.  It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead, decide to just have fun with the experience, regardless of the outcome.  Yes, even a bad date can be fun.  Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends.\\n\\nI find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work.

When I rewrote it this time, I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me.

I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. \\n\\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\\n\\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\\n\\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\\n\\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\\n\\n4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\\n\\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\\n\\nhope this helps?",

That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles.

The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.

A period of legal separation constitutes grounds for divorce; the length of that period varies from state to state.    Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple may reconcile, in which case they need do nothing in order to remain married.

If so, then this is what's called a \"disqualifying disposition\".  In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price).  \\n\\nIn general, the IRS wants you to pay tax in the quarter in which the related income is earned.  So you theoretically should pay the estimated tax at your standard income tax rate in the same quarter you exercise and sell ISOs.  You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return.     The following information is sourced from See http://www.fool.com/school/taxes/taxes35.htm. \\n\\n1.  The simplest way is just to suck it up and not worry about paying a penalty for underpayment of taxes.  Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000).  Be wary though that you probably can't keep doing this year after year without the IRS getting on your case. \\n\\n2.  Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\\n\\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\\n\\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\\n\\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill.  This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\\n\\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000.   If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\\n\\n\\n\\nClear?  As mud?\\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\\n\\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%).  \\n\\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.  However, that's a topic for a whole 'nother question/answer.   \\n\\n\\n* Even with NQSOs, if the amount held at source is less than your eventual tax rate for the year,  you may be subject to tax penalties unless you meet one of the exceptions listed in a) through d) above.",

The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.  The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\\n\\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.  The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\\n\\nA couple things to consider, though.  In order to switch to a double compact, you need to replace a fair number of components, including the bottom bracket, cranks, rear derailleur (optional but highly recommended), front derailleur and possibly your left shifter.

This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. \\n\\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. The set price is called the strike price. When you (the stock option holder) make use of your right to buy/sell stock according to the terms of the option, you are exercising the option. Call options are options giving you the right to buy stock. Put options are options giving you the right to sell stock. Employers grant call options to employees. Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. Let's say it's after four years now. Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\\n\\nStock grants are simpler to understand. The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. So let's use the Google example again. Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\\n\\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. This is done to give employees an incentive to stay at the company.",

Alpha Test was the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.

I'll tell you why in a little bit.\\n\\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles.  Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\\n\\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \\n\\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \\n\\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\\n\\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\\n\\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?",

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\\n\\nPopulation\\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\\n\\n\\nName\\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word \"Chelokee\" meaning \"people of a different speech.\" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) \"principal people\" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) \"people of Kituhwa.\" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\\n\\n\\nSub-tribes\\n\\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \\nLower",

A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight.",

This is not without controversy. Among the most vocal opponents are those in the deaf community, who feel that their culture and language are at stake (Cohen, 1994) and the Learning Disabilities Association of America, which believes that mandatory full inclusion policies violate federal law (\"Full inclusion,\" undated).",

And they're all great and wonderful individuals who don't seem to lack anything. I have had at times to explain certain things about the Christian religion to them, which is the dominant religion in the western world, and its practice can raise questions to the uninitiated.\\n\\nIf you seek spirituality, you should not limit your self to exploring one religion. Why do you dismiss Buddhism, Taoism etc? You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\\n\\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. Learn, and let it be your choice. If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\\n\\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\\n\\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). You can learn more on different religions by following the links below.\\n\\nI know in China most Christians are unitarian, since in 1949 the Government forced denominations to form one single church or leave China.\\n\\nRemember learn before you act, and don't let anyone influence you. My opinion is that once you decide on something you should stick by it. Should you make the conscious choice to have Faith in a religion. So being absolutely certain is essential. Changing religions in the manner you'd change shirts is not ideal. Because then Faith - which is the most important element in every religion - never gets too strong to mean anything in your life.\\n\\nWhatever choice you make - good luck to you!",

Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\\n\\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal. I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\\n\\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful.

The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\\n\\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs.

Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\\n2. Collect proof of misdeeds for each particular P2P service that is allowing illegal file copying.\\n3. Sue the P2P service and demand they hand over IP addresses of offending users.\\n4. Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\\n\\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\\n\\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\\n\\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\\n\\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\\n\\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\\n\\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\\n\\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school.  It makes them get a higher grade than they deserve and if the test is graded on a curve, your A- work can wind up being counted as a B+.  \\n\\nWell, songwriters composed that music and/or lyrics, musicians practiced and learned to play that song and paid to use a recording studio to perform it in.  When people don't pay to hear that play, the musicians still have their expenses to pay but no royalty check to pay for it.

Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a \"feed\").\\n\\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication \"universe\" right away. Free readers are available as well; a search for \"RSS Reader\" at popular search sites will yield many results.\\n\\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). Also, any upgrades or new features are added automatically. The trade-off comes in different (some would say fewer) features and slightly slower performance versus desktop systems.

Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide?

The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\\n\\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\\n\\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\\n\\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\\n\\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\\n\\n\\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX",

Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. Their work has yet to be completed. The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\\n\\n\\nStandards\\n\\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. This would ensure compatibility.\\n\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\\n\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. The setup would most likely begin with a router. This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. These allow any wired device to be included on the network. The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\\n\\n\\nAdvantages/Conclusions\\n\\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. Only then should 802.11n be considered.",

Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\\n\\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. It is contained in our mitochandria. Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key \"markers\" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\\n\\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. Let me give you an example. Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. Others will not be so lucky. If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are.",

His main occupations and services rendered were in Royal Prussia, as church canon, governor and administrator, economist, jurist, physician, astrologer and military leader (conducting defense against the Teutonic Order). Amid all his responsibilities, he treated astronomy as a hobby. His theory about the Sun as the center of the Universe, opposed to the traditional geocentric theory that placed Earth at the center, is considered one of the most important discoveries ever, and is the fundamental starting point of modern astronomy and modern science itself (it inaugurated a scientific revolution). His theory affected many aspects of human life, opening the door for young astronomers, scientists and scholars to take a skeptical attitude toward established dogma.\"",

Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\\n\\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\\n\\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. Without it, they would just be average.\\n\\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\\n\\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\\n\\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out.

I've lost right at 150 lbs. & I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :)\\n\\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity...don't know why. Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\\n\\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of \"bad nasties\". I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store...Victoria's Secret, to be exact. My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. But it just hit me oddly. I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\\n\\nThat's what did it...that's what started the whole process. By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. So, here's how I handled it...\\n\\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want...I'm not kidding. True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating but I also don't beat myself up about it. If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. The big problem for me was breads.\\n\\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\\n\\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes where you can.\\n\\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages...OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! But you know what? I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! That's motivation, I can promise you...\\n\\nMy suggestion after all",

It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after World War I. Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\\n\\n\\nOttoman Empire (ŏt'əmən) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\\nOrganization of the Empire\\n\\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\\n\\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\\n\\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\\n\\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\\n\\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. In Constantinople the Greeks and Armenians held a privileged status and were very influential in commerce and politics. The despotic system of government was mitigated only by the observance of Muslim law.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. The Ottomans, however, soon rallied.\\n\\nThe Period of Great Expansion\\n\\nThe empire, reunited by Muhammad I, expanded victoriously under Muhammad's successors Murad II and Muhammad II.

Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online. \\n\\nAnyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \\n\\nYou do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.\\n\\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \\n\\nHope this helps!\\nGoodluck,\\nDave",

Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.  Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice.  Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called \"faith\" and the controlling of culture through that so-called \"faith\"...thereby falling into suspicion of \"satanic\" influences.  It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\\n\\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.  Furthermore, any member of a masonic society will claim no knowledge of satanic connections to their brotherhood.

Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\\n\\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.  That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells).",

At the genetic level, cystic fibrosis is most often the result of an in-frame deletion of three base pairs in the DNA. Cystic fibrosis results from the production of an abnormal form of a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR functions in transporting chloride ions across epithelial cells found in the lung and intestinal tract. In CF patients, CFTR does not function properly, causing accumulation of ions inside epithelial cells. Since water follows ions by osmosis, this results in water depletion and viscous mucus on the surface of alveoli. The most common CFTR protein abnormality is a mutation termed ΔF508, which is characterized by the deletion of the DNA basepair sequence at chromosome location 7q31.1 that codes for a single amino acid, phenylalanine.",

I will try to explain them in as much non-tech terms as possible.\\n \\nSerialization:\\n Serialization is a process of saving state of an object in some format. State of an object means its current value which in turn comprises of the values of the members of the object. For example, if I have a class Student, having RollNo and Name as its members(properties), and an object of Student class 'Deobrat' is created with ROllNo=01 and Name=\"Deobrat Singh\". Then serialization of the object Deobrat would mean, saving this object somewhere (either in memorystream or in a filestream or on a networkstream) in such a way that it can later be reconstructed to again form the same object.\\nTo be a bit more elaborate, consider an example where I have to send an object across a network to some remote computer (something that we do in WebServices). Now, in this case, the object itself cannot be sent because the network doesn't recognise what an object is. It simply understands a stream of bytes and nothing else. Serialization allows us to convert this object into a stream of bytes which then could be sent across the network to the remote computer.\\n \\nDeserialization:\\n Deserialization is exactly the reverse process of Serialization. It means, to convert the stream of bytes in order to reconstruct the original object (or object state to be more precise). In the Web Service example scenario taken above, the Service Request broker will simply extract the stream of bytes, Deserialize them to create the object and give it to the class that is supposed to process it.\\n \\nExternalization:\\n Serialization is achieved in 2 ways.\\nUsing the Serializable interface which tells the runtime(or JVM) that the class has only premitive types that are serializable by themselves so the runtime can go ahead and use it's own code to serialize any object of this class. \\nOn the other hand, if you want to write a class that has complete control over the process of serialization & deserialization, you implement Externalizable interface. In this case, when an object of your class has to be serialized, the runtime will not do it by itself. Rather it will call a method writeExternal to serialize the object. You will have complete control over the stream and format of the data to serialize. While deserializing the object, again the runtime will call readExternal method on your class which is supposed to read the stream and reconstruct the object state.\\nA word of caution:\\n\\n In most cases, it is sufficient to use the Serializable interface because you wont have to write code for the serialization process. But in certain cases where you have a very heavy class with a lot of properties which need not be sent to the other end, it is better to write your code using Externalizable interface, because, then you will have complete control over which properties need to be serialized and which need not be serialized. While deserializing, again, your class will know which are the properties that must have been serialized and accordingly, you can recreate the object state.\\n\\nIn general, if you want a custom (in most cases, partial) serialization/deserialization to happen, you use Externalization.",

Most states now have a law on the books that requires all of the credit reporting agencies to give you a credit report once a year. Check it over. Make sure that there are no *mistakes* on it - late payments that were not late, disputed accounts, etc. \\n\\nLate payments and charged-off accounts stay on for 7 years, bankruptcies for 10. Generally, lenders are looking for patterns of behavior rather than once-in-a-way problems. If you find something wrong (and it's likely, unfortunately), write a letter to the credit bureau, providing documentation that you're right. They have to respond in 30 days; if the creditor can't prove that the negative item is indeed true, it comes off your report.\\n\\nNow you're down to real debt. If you can't afford the payments, contact the lenders and negotiate reduced payments. They will prefer to be getting something rather than having to write off the debt. Once you can afford to pay everything, commit to paying off the worst (i.e., highest-interest) items first. They cost you the most money that isn't going toward paying off the debt. Once you've killed one, the money you were spending on that one can be applied to the next-worst debt, and so on. The amount you can pay any given creditor snowballs rapidly when you follow this pattern. You have to remember, though, that when the first one is paid off, you don't have \"more money\". You still need to be committing that to killing your debt.\\n\\nIf you're out of debt, but your credit is lousy, get a secured card, use it, and pay it off every month. This will do a lot for your credit rating. In addition, open a savings account, and make regular deposits. This shows you are saving money and have a resource to pay your bills.",

Why should you believe in somehting of which there is no proof?  \\n\\nIn my personal opinion, there are only three reasons people become religious:\\n\\n1)  They are fearful.  Fearful of death, fearful of not knowing the purpose of their existence, fearful of losing everything that they value in this life (which you will, gauranteed).  Fear is a powerful motivator and when someone offers you a way to manage that fear through a belief system it can be tempting to accept.  There is no need to resort to philosophy, science or psyhcology.  There is no need to accept that there are rational and scientific explanations that we as humans simply don't know yet.   Just believe that someone's making it all right in the end and you're all set.\\n\\n2) They are seeking a path to redemption for past sins.  They are having difficulty coping with the consequences of some bad action they have taken in thier life, and or are trying to control some compulsive behavior that has caused hardship in their life.  Either they were in prison, got caught with a prostitue, or drank themselves out of job and their family, or simply told a horrible lie that they feel guilty about.  Religion offers instant redemption and rituals to help you ease your mind through repentance.  \\n\\n3)  They have a strong natural desire for community and companionship.  Having someplace to go every Sunday with likeminded people or having rituals to follow when someone dies, or having a language or framework to use when communicating your values with others can be very comforting.  If your family already subscribes to these beliefs you even may feel pressure to accept things that your logical mind tells you are impossible and&#92;or unlikely.\\n\\nYou can deal with these three situations through patience, meditation, compassion, seeking help from others, and community activism, or you can choose to believe in supernatural beings and mythology.  My personal opinion is that there is no easy way out of any problem so that when a christian says I can instantly have my sins forgiven or a Scientologist tells me that body thetans are causing my suffering, or some guru tells me that my Shakras just need alignments, I usually take a pass.",

There is simply too little energy coming from the sun to account for our planet's temperature. The controversial point is when global warming is applied to the current rise in average global temperature that has taken place over the past 50 so years.

In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\\n\\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\\n\\nHow is vasectomy done?\\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\\n\\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \\n\\nPage 2 of this Article \\nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\\nThe Doctor's Response\\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below −300°F (−185°F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period. However, there is considerable debate over the scientif",

Its alot of pulling and tugging to make a profit on Ebay.  But, products come and go all the time.  When fads hit, it also hits Ebay.  When the fads are gone, those numbers also dwindle on Ebay.  The other half is your ability to sell the product.  I have seen so many people sell the product the wrong way, that even if it was priced low enough, nobody would bid.  So, you have to figure out what drives customers to bid, regardless of the product.  Your best bet is creating a product and selling it on Ebay.  I have heard people selling things on Ebay that they made.  I heard someone making 200 a day selling hand made cloaks.  But, thats them, you have to find your own market.  Um, last part about ebay is reselling a product.  If you see something cheap enough to make a profit off of, then by all means buy it.  See, if you buy something for $100 and sell it for $105, you only made $5 buxx.  And after Ebay fees, you make \"jack.\"  But, if you can find a product for $12 dollars and sell it for $25, then you make a better profit.  Now its all up to you to sell as much as you can.  See?  So, small stuff can be worthwhile some times.  I used to do okay selling 99 cent coins.  Not bad for free stuff.  I would sell about 100 of them a week.  Thats not bad for 3 hours worth of work.  But, its not enough to live off of, so I sell other things as well.

In fact, during winter, the earth is physically closer to the sun and during the summer, it is furthest.\\n\\nTilt is key. Its important that not only is there a tilt on the earth, but the direction of that tilt is not altered during the rotation of the earth around the sun.\\n\\nThe Northern hemisphere is always tilting away during the winter, and towards the sun during the summer. The tilt of the earth is 23 degrees. So lets say you're at 45 degrees lattitude. During the summer, the sun will rise to 45+23 (68) degrees because the tilt is towards it, and in winter, the sun only goes to 45-23 (22) degrees. There is a big difference between the sun going up 22 degrees and the sun going to 68 degrees.\\n\\nWhen the sun goes to 68 degrees, it is more overhead, and the earth therefore receives more of its rays. During winter, light rays are striking obliquely, and hence do not warm the earth as much.\\n\\nThis is why there are less variations of seasons around the equator, where the sun is almost always directly overhead all the time.\\n\\nAnd this is why seasons are reversed on the southern hemisphere. When the northern hemisphere tilts towards the sun, the south is tilting away.",

Simply put, the Sun is up longer in the sky (rises earlier and sets later) in summer. Clocks and common mechanical timepieces keep what's called civil time, which roughly corresponds to the passage of a fictitious \"average\" Sun through our sky. This is necessary since the Sun does not rise and set on a regular basis, but changes by as much as 15 minutes throughout the course of the year.\\n\\nDaylight Saving Time was generally adopted by countries around World War I, but President Wilson repealed the United States' mandatory daylight savings law on March 31, 1918. During World War II, Daylight Savings Time was reestablished by law on a year-round basis, and later seen as a fuel saving measure during the Arab Oil Embargo crisis of 1973-74. In late 1974, standard time was brought back. During World War II, the U.S. and some other countries implemented \"double\" daylight savings time consisting of a two hour shift.",

He gambled on the possibility that we would forget what he did, become desensitized to it, and dismiss the jury's decision overly harsh.

But when in love, we often miss the red flags, so if that happens, here are what I consider serious and justifiable grounds:\\n\\nAdultery -- many people can't move past this.  It's a physical betrayal, but also tears at you emotionally.  I personally think it's one of the most difficult ones to resolve.\\n\\nAbuse -- physical or verbal.  Verbal often gets overlooked, but it's namecalling, screaming at you rather than holding a normal conversation, talked down to, and did I mention yelling and screaming?  If you ask the person a normal question, like \"do you have any change for the toll?\" and they start screaming that \"all you do is harp about money,\" you've got a problem.  Physical is obvious, but don't overlook punching walls, breaking dishes, etc.  Watch out for signs of roughness or  meanness to your children and pets too.\\n\\nControl Freaks:  This is also a form of abuse, but these men want to know your every move, monitor your phone calls, read your email and voice mails, won't let you go to the mall alone, etc.  Insist that if you get a new hairdo or buy a new dress, it must be because you're cheating with someone.  This is usually disguised as jealousy which women may think lattering -- at first.  Don't be fooled.  Control freaks also don't want you to hold a job or have any money of your own.  You must beg for an \"allowance.\"\\n\\nFinancial:  There are a lot of men who live off women.  They have jobs when you meet them.  Then, something happens, and it's always the company or bosses fault.  They tell you they're out job hunting, but nothing is happening.  Next comes laying around on the couch all day, sleeping, watching tv or guzzling beer.  Weeks turn into months and it's just you working.  Or, the person flits from job to job and can't hold a job.  This man will plunge you right into financial ruin and guess what -- you can't get them out of the house all that easy, if it happens to be your house and not a joint home.  Keep an eye out that they don't dip into your wallet.  A dollar or two missing, here and there, usually becomes much more.  You'll get behind on bills, your credit will suffer.  Don't stand for this.\\n\\nAddictive behavior:  Drugs, alchoholism, gambling.  Will cause you nothing but stress, pain and financial hardship.  Don't try to be the hero and \"help\" the person out of despair.  Unless you are rich enough to get them into very good rehab, like the movie stars do, it probably won't work.  Addicts can only be helped if they want to be and you'll be surprised how many enjoy the behavior and have no desire to give it up.  I've seen men go to AA or a counseling session, come right out and stop at a bar.  It is almost a joke with them.  You may keep gamblers out of casinos, but they'll spend a whole paycheck on lottery tickets or the football pool.\\n\\nIllegal behavior:  Selling drugs, stealing, pulls insurance scams, (or any scams), etc., RUN.  He'll eventually get caught and you might get implicated too!  Do you want his record to become yours?\\n\\nGood luck.",

It was made into an Academy Award-winning motion picture starring Gregory Peck by director Robert Mulligan in 1962. A coming-of-age story, it is told from the point of view of Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch, the young daughter of Atticus Finch, an educated lawyer in Maycomb, Alabama, a small town in the deep South of the United States. She is accompanied by her brother Jem and their mutual friend Dill.\\n\\nTruman Capote was a lifelong friend of childhood neighbor Lee, and allegedly was the inspiration for Dill's character in her best-seller. Capote frequently implied that he himself had written a considerable portion of her novel, and some have said he ghosted the entire novel. At least one person—Pearl Kazin Bell, an editor at Harper's— has gone on record as believing his assertions were true.\\n\\nThe title of the book is taken from Atticus's advice to his children about firing their air rifles at birds: \"Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\". The blue jay is a very common bird, and is often perceived as a bully and a pest, whereas mockingbirds do nothing but \"sing their hearts out for us\". Metaphorically, several of the book's characters can be seen as \"mockingbirds\", attacked despite doing nothing but good. The mockingbird represents innocence, and to kill one is to metaphorically kill innocence. Note that the protagonists are also named after birds: Tom Robinson and the Finch family. However, \"Finch\" was also Lee's mother's maiden name.\\n\\nHarper Lee stated, \"To get the ideas for the book I used recent events in my time like the Scottsboro Trials.\" (Harper Lee, Book Review, 1964)\\n\\nThe events of this book's publication and the following film are also subjects of the 2005 film Capote starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee.

Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. \\n\\n    But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

Next, turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home.  Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table, and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom--or whereever you're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred.

Nutrients, wastes, and hormones are exchanged across the thin walls of capillaries. Capillaries are microscopic in size, although blushing is one manifestation of blood flow into capillaries. Control of blood flow into capillary beds is done by nerve-controlled sphincters. \\n\\n\\nChanges in blood pressure, velocity, and the area of the arteries, capillaries, and veins of the circulatory system.

I've been programming for 15 years and had been seriously hoping to make my own language one of these days, because all the languages I was used to had severe limitations at every turn.  I don't know how to explain all the reasons why I hate conventional languages, but let it suffice to say that Ruby lets you do virtually anything you want to do; it supports a wide variety of programming styles, and can do many things that are difficult or impossible in other languages, such as metaprogramming (the possibilities with this seem endless), arbitrarily changing existing classes (including built-in classes), coroutines (although you'll have to implement them yourself, since Ruby only has continuations built in), lightweight (non-OS) threads, closures, multiple inheritance (well, not exactly, but Ruby's \"mixins\" are just as good), \"freezing\" objects, and on and on.\\n\\nAlso, after reading through the online book Programming Ruby, I got the feeling that the designer and developer (\"Matz\") really knew what he was doing.  The parts of the language fit together well and on the whole, the language is well rounded, with a feature for everyone.\\n\\nFinally, Ruby is easy to play with, because\\n(1) you don't have do define a class and a method and write a ton of import/include/using statements (as in Java/C#/C++) -- code at the top level automatically runs (in a hidden method called \"main\", I think.)\\n(2) you get the interactive interpreter called IRB, with which you can type statements and get immediate results.  Multi-line statements (such as method and class definitions) are also allowed.\\n\\nThe one big problem with Ruby is that it is dynamically typed and interpreted, and thus very slow, although I've heard it is not much slower than Python or Perl.\\n\\nMy second favorite language is C# 2.0, which has most of the features I would want in a statically-typed language.  (although there's certainly enough missing that I still wish I had time to develop my own language.)",

Independent variables, such as climate, uplift, base level, erodibility of surficial materials, and impact of man, are changing at rates that are sufficiently rapid as to preclude attainment of steady state, particularly for those landforms that require geologic time spans to approach steady-state configurations.

Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but can differ in the number of neutrons, in which case they are called isotopes of that element. Atoms are electrostatically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus are less tightly bound to the atom and are relatively easily transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Particles in the nucleus also sometimes escape atoms, in a process known as radioactive decay.\\n\\nAtoms are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry, and are conserved in chemical reactions.

Daylight savings is a human invention, not a natural phenomenon.\\n\\n...because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth's rotation slowing down.\\n\\nThe amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.\\n\\nEven that is an approximation, the decimal digits can keep going on.\\n\\nSo initially, the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days. But about every 4 years, you'd be off 1 day. A century later, you've drifted off by a whole month!\\n\\nSo, leap years came into effect. Febuary has another day every 4 years. \\n\\nBut now you've approximated a year to 365.25 days, when in reality, its 365.2425 days.\\n\\nEvery century, you'll be off 1 day.\\n\\nSo that's where the next rule comes into play: \"If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, its a leap year.\"\\n\\nNow we've approximated it to 365.2425, but because its always going to be an approximation, our calendar days are always slipping. All because the earth doesn't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.\\n\\nThis is why leap seconds are added, and not to account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation.\\n\\nAs to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours, I'm not sure. But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes, or we'd notice that soon enough, its dark at noon! :)  Time was divided a long time ago, and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it, so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with. The lost time, if its accounted for by leap years and such, could be easier to manage.\\n\\nFirst, I never said the earth is not slowing down. I said its not why leap seconds exist. And ok, I can entertain my explanation may be wrong, but that's no reason for your condescending tone, Jolly Roger. But look, your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site, where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect? \\n\\nYou haven't bothered to explain his original question. If leapseconds account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation, why are there leap seconds and not leap milliseconds?\\n\\nIf you want to append to your answer, at least try to do so while respecting the other users on this site, and not insult their intelligence.\\n\\nThis has piqued my curiosity, if there's anyone out there that has a source that says my explanation is incorrect, I mean an actual science website, you know, one that steers clear of religion, please let me know.",

Here are some tips for getting started:\\n\\n    * Study in chunks: 20-50 minute time periods followed by a brief break (5-10 minutes) is the most effective way to study\\n    * Use daylight hours: an hour of studying during the day is worth two at night! Do the work that requires the most concentration (typically reading) earliest in the day.\\n    * Rank your three classes and be sure to spend time on your most challenging class everyday and early in the day.\\n    * Study actively: ask yourself questions, review your notes regularly, discuss key concepts with peers and course professor \\n\\nWhere to Study:\\n\\nAlthough studying in a dorm room is convenient, it is often a poor place to learn. The dorm has a plethora of distractions including Blitzmail, Snood, the telephone, video games, friends down the hall.

This is accomplished by showing close ties to your home country.\\n\\nYou should present evidence of the following things at your visa interview:\\n1)  A letter from your employer indicating that you have a good job and are expected to return to your job after you return.\\n2)  A copy of your bank statements showing that you have sufficient money to fund your trip.\\n3)  A copy of your lease/mortgage showing that you have a home in Georgia that you can not leave.\\n4)  Proof of a car.\\n5)  Photos of you travelling in other developed countries.  For example, if you went to London on vacation and came back, you are more likely to return to Georgia after visiting New York.\\n6)   A good reason to visit America.  I would say that you want to go to Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  Don't say: I want to stay at my cousin's house for three months.\\n7) Luck.  Honestly, if your cousin lives in Chicago and the visa officer is from Chicago, you will have better luck.  I once went to a lecture by a visa officer.  He said that he once approved somebody because an applicant was planning on studying in America, but wanted to look at colleges first.  One of the five colleges listed, was the speakers small liberal arts college.  Because of that, the visa was granted.",

Roosevelt and Bonaparte both were \"Progressives.\" They shared the conviction that efficiency and expertise, not political connections, should determine who could best serve in government. Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States in 1901; four years later, he appointed Bonaparte to be Attorney General. In 1908, Bonaparte applied that Progressive philosophy to the Department of Justice by creating a corps of Special Agents. It had neither a name nor an officially designated leader other than the Attorney General. Yet, these former detectives and Secret Service men were the forerunners of the FBI.\\n\\nBy 1907, the Department of Justice most frequently called upon Secret Service \"operatives\" to conduct investigations. These men were well-trained, dedicated -- and expensive. Moreover, they reported not to the Attorney General, but to the Chief of the Secret Service. This situation frustrated Bonaparte, who wanted complete control of investigations under his jurisdiction. Congress provided the impetus for Bonaparte to acquire his own force. On May 27, 1908, it enacted a law preventing the Department of Justice from engaging Secret Service operatives.\\n\\nThe following month, Attorney General Bonaparte appointed a force of Special Agents within the Department of Justice. Accordingly, ten former Secret Service employees and a number of Department of Justice peonage (i.e., compulsory servitude) investigators became Special Agents of the Department of Justice. On July 26, 1908, Bonaparte ordered them to report to Chief Examiner Stanley W. Finch. This action is celebrated as the beginning of the FBI.",

It starts off with this guy who removes rivets (screws) from an airplane wing so that he could sell them for profit. Each rivet/screw represents a unique species that plays an important role in our ecosystem. The loss of each one has an adverse effect on the whole structure. It is true that such effects may or may not have an immediate recognizable effect on us but that does not mean that it is not happening. Also, we humans, have proven that we are really self centered that we do not recognize the damage that we are doing unless it hits us in the face. There are countless examples of chain reactions in the ecosystem due to a loss of an integral species. For example, (although I am no longer certain about the details) due to the misuse of a pesticide by farmers in rural Peru, an outbreak of more resistant  pests evolved. The farmers in reaction started to use more pesticides which affected the other species that naturally feed on and control these pests. The situation got so bad that it escalated to such an extent that cats which controlled the rat population died out because they got the higher dose of the poisonous pesticide in their system. Finally, (believe it or not) they had to fly cats to the area and dropped them from helicopters...thus it did rain cats that day in Peru.",

Let him get comfortable with you.\\n\\nA guy will usually like a girl who laughs at his jokes. It shows she is atuned to him. Kind of thinks the same way he does.  It kind of validates his attitude or way of thinking.  It is kind of like you saying to him, \"that is very smart\" without coming right out and saying it.  Of course, only if he said something funny!\\n\\nAsk him for his opinion, once in a while.  Things like \"what do YOU think?\" or \"which one do YOU prefer?\" are good questions.  They are easy for him to answer if you are asking about something that is in the front of his mind at the moment.\\n\\nQuestions like \"what are you THINKING?\" are almost always hard for guys to answer, on the other hand.  They may not be thinking much of anything, but if they say that, they sound kind of stupid.  Or they might be thinking about something boring. If they tell you what it is, you will think they are boring. \\n\\nTry not to put them on the spot like that, at least not until you are at the flirting stage. At that point, you can sort of hint what they should be thinking.  In other words, a question can be a little bit like taking a test.  If you are going to give them one, make sure it is an easy one.\\n\\nDress nice, of course.  But do not worry about if your clothes or accessories are really expensive.  Know why?\\n\\nGuys have no idea how much girls' clothes cost. They might not even know how much their own clothes cost.\\n\\nLots of boys when they are taken clothing shopping just want to get in and get out of that store.\\n\\nThey might really care about a jacket, true. Shoes, possibly - like if they are into sports and need a good shoe for their sport or running. But pants, socks, belts, shirts - probably just wearing them because they have to.  Jackets and coats are a little different.\\n\\nIf you want to catch a guy's eye, do some color-coordindation.  For example, if you have a sweater or shirt with some lavendar in it, wearing earings or a hair clip that is exactly the same color will look really neat.  He will think you are a sharp dresser.\\n\\nThe same thing goes for your eyes.  If you wear a shirt that has some of the same color as your eyes, that might catch his eyes.  Up to ten percent of all guys are slightly color blind though. Details vary, but some guys cannot even tell red from green.  So if doing that color matching thing does not work, do not take it too hard.  Or, try matching two things of a different color than the first one you tried.\\n\\nI guess if varies from guy to guy but usually a nice hairstyle catches my eye.  If your hair looks nice, he might notice that.\\n\\nLooking straight into his eyes when you are talking to him.  That might get you noticed more too.\\n\\nBeing fit, in good shape helps.  You don't have to be super skinny or super strong.  You don't really have to be super anything.  Just be healthy.\\n\\nAlso, if you are happy and smile a lot, guys like that.  Talking with other guys or girls is good too.  It shows you are social, you make friends easily, and you have friends.  That makes you more interesting, probably.\\n\\nIf you go overboard trying to do something to make him like you, it could backfire a little.  If you laugh at his jokes when you really don't think they are funny at all, he might sense from your tone or your expression that you are being kind of phony.\\n\\nSometimes you can be a little sarcastic, kind of dig at him a little with a comment, just to get his attention.  But don't start putting him down or calling him stupid or weak.  That will just get him mad or hurt.  And, even if it doesn't, it will put his friends off toward you. They could start to feel like they need to protect him from you, maybe suggest he find a different girlfriend.\\n\\nYou could also get him a gift.  It does not have to be something expe",

A breathing excercise helps, I use the \"breath in to count of three, hold for four, breath out for 5\" routine.  Get as relaxed as possible and concentrate on raising yourself up out of your body.  If you can concentrate easily it takes less tries of course, but you will actually feel it happen.  Whether that's a dream or not I don't know.  When you get to that point pick a place in the house to go to and concentrate on going there.  It's really simple, and doesn't take a great deal of effort.  This is the stage I was able to achieve, around 1986, when I stopped and never did it again.  Nothing really scary, I guess it just convinced me enough and I left it at that.\\n\\nGood luck.",

Although other browsers have introduced these features, Firefox became the first such browser to achieve wide adoption.\\n\\nFirefox has attracted attention as an alternative to other browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. As of November 2005, estimates suggest that Firefox's usage share is around 9.4% of overall browser usage (See market adoption), with its highest usage in Finland (about 30%).

Training might start by specifying steps needed to accomplish a particular task, but more than this is needed to assure that certain skills or procedures are learned. Participants in a training course should practice the desired behavior and receive pertinent feedback to support what's right and correct what's wrong. If feedback is given genuinely in a trusting and caring atmosphere, behavior might not only be directly improved, but one's thinking or attitude associated with the behavior might be positive. \\n\\nConversely, education focuses on trying to influence participants' cognitive or thinking processes. This kind of education might increase profound knowledge or critical thinking skills, and this could lead to behavior change.

What I advise my clients to do is to actually THINK like a search engine or if that is too abstract, think like someone who speaks a different language. \\n\\nAlthough search engines are getting much better at figuring out exactly what it is that is on the page, remember it is often impossible for them to decipher Java, Javascript, Flash, and other non-HTML components. This is NOT to say don't use them, just use them when they are to be used appropriately.\\n\\nBecause search engines ARE getting better at figuring out what is on a page, spelling and grammar are also very important. The rule of thumb is no more than three misspellings and no more than three gramatical errors on a page. Sentences should be of short to medium length and paragraphs should also be rather short.\\n\\nDO NOT COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK. The search engines can penalize a site heavily for plagiarism.\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nTitle Tags -- The most important of all tags is the Title tag. This is what shows up on the bars on the bottom of your computer screen. Most people make the mistake of putting their company name in the Title Tag and that is the worst thing to do (other than putting no tag at all). A Title Tag should be short and to the point and tell what the page is about and if you want to add your company name then add it at the END of the title tag not at the beginning.\\n\\nMeta Tags -- Meta tags were how search engines would know what was on a page... many years ago. However, with that said it is important that Meta tags are still added to your site and more importantly there are new meta tags (more than just description and keywords) that should be added to the web site such as content type and content language.\\n\\nMeta Description -- Meta description should start out with the SAME thing your TITLE tag says and then go into more detail. \\n\\nMeta Keywords -- Meta keywords are words used to describe what is in your page. First use keywords that are in the title and the description first. Then use keywords that are in the content of the page. DO NOT try to spam the search engines by using keywords that are not relevant to your content.\\n\\nAlt Tags -- With the advent of XHTML, ALT tags for images are now REQUIRED. The Alt tag is used for people who have their images turned off so it is important to have in the alt tag exactly what the image is but also expand on what it is. An example would be a HOME button. Instead of just having HOME as the Alt Tag, use Home -- Site Name.com. \\n\\nI have noticed that search engines love geography and it is good to put that in there whenever appropriate. If your company is in Kansas City, MO then put those in the Content and in the Tags.\\n\\nLINKS\\n\\nHaving links that send people to sites relevant to your site is always a good practice. People ask me where I get links and how do I get people to link to my site. The answer is very simple. First I ask. I write e-mails (NOT SPAM) to sites asking if they wish to reciprocate links with me and I also have on some of my pages a \"Link to this Page\" button so that web site owners can do it on their own.\\n\\nThere is great debate as to whether links to other sites that are not of the same category help, hurt, or are indifferent. From my ten years experience I have found that appropriate links DO NOT hurt your web site and could very well help in some instances.\\n\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\n\\nI won't go into much detail here but make sure you have one. So many people forget this and it is extremely important. You will NOT find a major web page that does not have a Privacy Policy attached to it.\\n\\nTRAFFIC\\n\\nObviously the more traffic you have coming to your web site the better. Not only ar",

Writing in a special review of sleep in the current issue of Nature, Dr Siegel says that it may be related to defence against oxidative stress. Smaller animals have higher metabolic rates, and this results in the generation of higher levels of small, highly reactive molecules such as free radicals. Studies on rats show that when they are deprived of sleep, their oxidative stress increases. Dr Siegel proposes that animals with higher metabolic rates need more sleep to interrupt and protect against this kind of oxidative damage, as well as repairing any damage done.",

Not because it can't be done, but because you would need to work with clients that are able to set up the hardware and software on their own sites. Usually, people hire you to solve problems -- and the video conferencing has a serious potential to CREATE problems, especially long distance.\\n\\nBefore you launch a VA practice, research the name you plan to use for the business (an Internet search is a great place to begin) because you don't want to use a name that's already in use (and possibly trademark protected).\\n\\nThen consider your strengths and weaknesses. Do an honest self-assessment to determine what services you can offer that will benefit your clients while emphasising your skills, background and education without requiring you to delve into areas that are not your best.\\n\\nIf you are going to be a VA, a website is essential. If creating a good website isn't your strength -- hire it out or barter services with someone else who can create an effective site.\\n\\nMarket yourself everywhere you go (business cards at the ready). And, always look for opportunities to talk about what you do -- this is most easily achieved by asking others about their own work (they will usually return the favor). Although Virtual Assistance is a known term in many circles, it still seems to create a bit of interest in casual conversation -- use that to your advantage by begin able to answer questions about the industry in general and your own business in particular.\\n\\nRead articles by others on the topic of running your own VA business.\\n\\nBe sure you are willing to put in the hours required to start and run a business. It's not as simple as announcing and starting to work. You will need to research your market, talk with people in the business, talk with people in your target industry/industries, read, research on the web and...

It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\\n\\nIn a human male orgasm, there are rapid, rhythmic contractions of the prostate, urethra and the muscles at the base of the penis, which (in the adult) typically force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. This is referred to as ejaculation. The process usually takes from 3 to 10 seconds. The process is usually, but not always, extremely pleasurable. Orgasm is generally induced by direct stimulation of the penis. Some men experience heightened orgasm by direct stimulation of the prostate through the perineum.\\n\\nFollowing ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs during which a man cannot have another orgasm. This period can be anywhere from less than a minute to over half a day, depending on age and other individual factors. A very few cases have been reported of men who appear to have no refractory period at all. Scientists theorize that a pituitary gland disorder or difference may cause this unique ability.\\n\\nIn a human female orgasm, orgasm is preceded by moistening of the vaginal walls, and an enlargement of the clitoris due to increased blood flow trapped in the clitoris's spongy tissue. Some women exhibit a sex flush; a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman comes closer to having orgasm, the clitoris moves inward under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (minor lips) becomes darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the vagina decreases in size by about 30% and also becomes congested with blood. The uterus then experiences muscular contractions. A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. The majority of women consider these contractions to be very pleasurable.\\n\\nAfter the orgasm is over, the clitoris re-emerges from under the clitoral hood, and returns to its normal size in less than 10 minutes. Unlike men, women either do not have a refractory period or have a very short one, and thus can experience a second orgasm soon after the first; some women can even follow this with a third, or even fourth orgasm; this is known as having multiple orgasms. After the initial orgasm, subsequent climaxes may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates. Research shows that about 13% of women experience multiple orgasms; a larger number may be able to experience this with the proper stimulation (such as a vibrator) and frame of mind. However, some women's clitorises are too sensitive after orgasm, making additional stimulation painful; they are probably not able to experience multiple orgasms",

Either by running away or fighting the tiger(metaphorically or literally).  digestion is absolutely one of them.  when in a stressful situation your bowels are the last thing you need to think about if per say, primatively speaking, you are being chased by a tiger.  some people evacuate immediately: diarrhea or hold it in until they are safe: constipation.   if they are under constant stress, then the body perceives this as a signal to continue coping as it has been which could cause constant constipation and/or diarrhea or other problems such as hormonal imbalances(because when you are super-stressed for example having a baby is the last thing your body can handle), weight gain or loss etc..  \\nSuggestions:\\n(I have a theory, see if it fits).

Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process. Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.\\nNicotine replacement therapy\\nIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin (transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch) , the nasal mucosa (nicotine nasal spray) or the buccal mucosa (nicotine chewing gum). Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\n      Transdermal Nicotine Patches\\n      The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated, and provides constant, steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn. They are quite simple to use, help prevent weight gain, cravings, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable\\n      Side Effects of the patch\\n      Patches may cause a local skin reaction,and insomnia with nightmares may occur.\\n\\n      Overdosing in nicotine is possible, especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch. Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack.\\n      Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products...i.e. no smoking or chewing tobacco.\\n\\n      Cost\\n      Patches are expensive and cost close to $100 per month of use.\\n      However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $1000 per year, which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car.\\n      Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money. Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know. However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system, and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine. the key word here is reliable.\\n\\n      The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream. The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate, and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this. Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin. Individual differences in skin thickness, location of the applied patch, and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered.\\n      3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch\\n          o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms)\\n          o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled.\\n          o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met.\\n          o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely.\\n\\n      It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use, others shorter. If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch.\\n\\n      Types of nicotine patches\\n            Nicotrol\\n            15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches\\n     ",

It's also pretty wide - wider than her old tower by 2-3 inches.  \\n\\nBecause my client wanted several measures of reliability and backup, we had the system preconfigured with a mirrored RAID array (2x250GB HDs), a DVD+/-RW drive for ad hoc backups, and an external harddrive for scheduled backups that can backup the entire drive.  Since she also wanted to be able to do graphics editing in the future, we got the machine with a GeForce 6800 graphics card (leaving open the option to add a second card in SLI configuration at a later date, if needed, though if they'd offered the option earlier, I would have recommended the 7800 GTX) and got a good 5.1 sound card installed as well (hooked up to old speakers, but WTF - it's her money) and 2GB RAM, with room to go up to 4GB if needed.\\n\\nFor external expansion, it comes with 8 USB 2.0 ports, and 3(?) firewire ports.  6 of the USB ports are in the back, with 2 firewire, while 3 are in front, behind a small panel.  We actually used most of the USB ports while setting up most of her peripherals, but you can always add a USB 2.0 high speed hub if you have that many additional devices.    If you have older keyboards and/or mice you're fond of that are PS/2, the machine does have ports for those as well.   (My client is still using a 10-year old keyboard from her old 486 PC that ran Windows 95.  I think it's Dorian Grey's keyboard, and has a printout of itself aging in a closet somewhere.)  If you have an old parallel printer though, it does NOT have a parallel port, so you'll need a parallel to USB cable or you'll need to order a parallel port card.\\n\\nFrom a software standpoint, the machine is very nice to use - everything runs very smoothly (in part thanks to the dual core CPU) with the only hiccup being AOL, which was preinstalled, but still has problems even in version 9.0 with playing well with Internet Explorer, since AOL uses the IE kernel for its own browsing component - running the two at the same time caused problems.\\n\\nAll in old, I'd say this is an excellent PC, competitive with other high end PCs from boutique manufacturers.  Where it falls short is the ability to get Dell on the phone - even with \"a separate queue just for XPS users\", we were on hold for close to an hour without ever speaking with a representative when trying to find out whether the shipped PC actually matched the original specs fro when the PC was ordered through the website.  Smaller PC vendors, such as Falcon-Northwest, VoodooPC, Monarch, and ABS are much better about being responsive to customers after the sale than Dell was here.  Aside from that, it's an excellent PC.",

The religion of Islam is not named after a person as in the case of Christianity which was named after Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Gotama Buddha, Confucianism after Confucius, and Marxism after Karl Marx. Nor was it named after a tribe like Judaism after the tribe of Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus. Islam is the true religion of \"Allah\" and as such, its name represents the central principle of Allah's \"God's\" religion; the total submission to the will of Allah \"God\". The Arabic word \"Islam\" means the submission or surrender of one's will to the only true god worthy of worship \"Allah\" and anyone who does so is termed a \"Muslim\", The word also implies \"peace\" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Hence, it was not a new religion brought by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) I in Arabia in the seventh century, but only the true religion of Allah re-expressed in its final form. \\n\\nIslam is the religion which was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind. The name of God's religion lslam was not decided upon by later generations of man. It was chosen by Allah Himself and clearly mentioned in His final revelation to man. In the final book of divine revelation, the Qur'aan, Allah states the following:\\n\\n\\n\"This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion\". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3)\\n\\n\\n\"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will It be accepted of Him\" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85)\\n\\n\\n\"Abraham was not a Jew nor Christian; but an upright Muslim.\" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:67)\\n\\n              Islam is the way of life for those who believe in God and want to live a life in worship and obedience to none but God.

War can be traced back to the Indo-European root *wers-, “to confuse, mix up.” In the Germanic family of the Indo-European languages, this root gave rise to several words having to do with confusion or mixture of various kinds. One was the noun *werza-, “confusion,” which in a later form *werra- was borrowed into Old French, probably from Frankish, a largely unrecorded Germanic language that contributed about 200 words to the vocabulary of Old French. From the Germanic stem came both the form werre in Old North French, the form borrowed into English in the 12th century, and guerre (the source of guerrilla) in the rest of the Old French-speaking area. Both forms meant “war.” Meanwhile another form derived from the same Indo-European root had developed into a word denoting a more benign kind of mixture, Old High German wurst, meaning “sausage.” Modern German Wurst was borrowed into English in the 19th century, first by itself (recorded in 1855) and then as part of the word liverwurst (1869), the liver being a translation of German Leber in Leberwurst.",

He was 63. \\n\\nMcDaniel, who lost both of his kidneys about 4 1/2 years ago, died Thursday night at Cy-Fair Medical Clinic in Houston, his oldest daughter said. He'd been in failing health in recent years, often undergoing kidney dialysis. McDaniel was on a waiting list to receive a kidney transplant. \\n\\nHe was born in Bernice, La., on June 19, 1938, and was a schoolboy football star at Midland (Texas) High School in the 1950s. \\n\\nMcDaniel moved on to the University of Oklahoma, where he lettered at linebacker from 1957-59. He holds the school record for the longest punt with a 91-yarder against Iowa State in 1958. \\n\\n\"He was a wild, crazy Indian,\" daughter Nicky Rowe said Friday. \"He was bigger than life. He was just amazing.\" \\n\\nThe 5-foot-11, 280-pound McDaniel was selected by Los Angeles in the second round of the American Football League draft in 1960. He bounced around the AFL for much of his eight-year career, spending time with the Houston Oilers, Denver Broncos, New York Jets and, finally, the Miami Dolphins. \\n\\nBy the end of his football career, McDaniel had already established himself as a big name in minor-league wrestling circuits around the country. But as a member of the Jets, McDaniel began to headline wrestling events at Madison Square Garden with the help of the arena's owner, Sonny Werblin. Werblin also was involved in the ownership of the Jets. \\n\\nMcDaniel capitalized on the stardom from his gridiron days to make a smooth transition into full-time wrestling. He became one of the country's most popular and beloved wrestlers during the '60s, '70s and '80s. \\n\\n\"He was one of the first to make transition from football to wrestling,\" said Bob Ryder, who operates the wrestling Web site, 1wrestling.com. \"When he found out he was making more money as a wrestler than a football player, he gave up football. He was such a big star.\" \\n\\nOver the course of his 30-year wrestling career, McDaniel had memorable battles with wrestling stars such as \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and Sgt. Slaughter. He won several titles before retiring in 1989. \\n\\n\"I wrestled all the top wrestlers in the world, and I traveled a lot,\" McDaniel said once. \"I got to see a lot of places that I probably wouldn't have gotten to see.\" \\n\\nHe was also fiercely proud of his Chickasaw Indian heritage and always entered the ring with his trademark elaborate feather headdress. \\n\\nShortly after retiring, health problems limited McDaniel to one of his newfound passions -- golf. He lived in Charlotte, N.C., until recently, but moved to Houston to live with his daughter and son-in-law as his health began to deteriorate. \\n\\n\"He also became a mentor to a lot of other wrestlers,\" Rowe said. \"He was so famous, I just didn't realize it until now. We've got so many calls from people.\" \\n\\nRowe said the family plans to cremate McDaniel's body and scatter the ashes over a lake near Del Rio, which was once the favorite fishing spot for her father and grandfather. They also plan to hold a memorial service for McDaniel in Midland next week. \\n\\nHe is survived by two daughters and a son.",

When I decided what to go on, I thought about what I'd have to do for it.  I was a bit worried about giving myself a shot, and I figured that I would need to have the least intrusive method of medication delivery... so I decided subcutaneous (just under the skin).  That cut down the list of interferons... \\n\\nThen I thought about side effects, a lot of the interferons have flu like symptoms.  When I started the meds, I was feeling weak, pins and needly, and limpy.  I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that.  No siree.\\n\\nI mean, you really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends.  It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!).  That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place.  My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone.  Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect.\\n\\nI WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots.  Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so you don't even have to see the needle.  Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs.  I gave it to myself without hesitation the first time!  I am a little wary of someone else doing it (though she had recommended that my fiance learn how, too).\\n\\nResult?  Well, there's not much to say!  (that's a good thing)... my original symptoms had faded, and I don't know if that was the copaxone or what.  I've been on it since 2/2004 (wow!  going on 2 years soon!), and I have NO NEW LESIONS!  boy, that's more exciting than I thought it was going to be.\\n\\nNow, your milage WILL vary, and unlike my first time experience, you will LIKELY have to go through a few drugs to find one you like.\\n\\nGood luck to you!",

Our solar system was all formed at that time. \\n\\nHow did the moon form?\\nWe think that the moon and Earth formed at about the same time, back when our whole solar system was formed. Earth was forming from many chunks of rock and icy material. Possibly a big chunk hit the new Earth and knocked loose a big piece, which became the moon. \\n\\nHow hot and cold does it get on the moon?\\nAs you may have learned, the moon doesn't have any air around it. The air that surrounds our earth acts as a nice blanket to keep us warm and comfy! But the moon, since it doesn't have this blanket, gets much colder than the earth — and much hotter than the earth. On the side of the moon that the sun is shining on, the temperature reaches 260°Fahrenheit! That is hotter than boiling. On the dark side of the moon, it gets very cold, -280° Fahrenheit. \\n\\nWhat is the surface of the moon like?\\nThe surface of the moon has about two inches of dust. Much of this dust has fallen to the moon from the spaces between the planets over the last several billions years. It probably feels pretty soft. You can see this in some pictures taken by the astronauts of their footprints on the moon. \\n\\nHow many holes are in the moon?\\nWe call those holes \"craters.\" They are the places where many years ago meteors hit the surface of the moon and put dents into it. There are thousands of big craters, but even more little ones. There are probably millions of little craters on the moon! Some are only an inch or so across. \\n\\nWhy does the moon have big rocks?\\nThe moon is made up of various kinds of rocks. These rocks are fairly similar to the rocks on earth. But on earth, we have wind and rain that help wear the rocks down into sand and dirt. There is no air or wind on the moon, so the rocks don't get worn down as they do on the earth. \\n\\nHow many moons are there all together?\\nEarth has only one moon. If you count all the moons around all the planets in our solar system, there are 61 (Earth has one, Mars has two, Jupiter has 16, Saturn has 18, Uranus has 15, Neptune has 8, and Pluto has one). There may be more that we haven't discovered yet! \\n\\nWhy does the moon change its shape (as in full, half, and quarter moon)?\\nThe bright part of the moon is the part that the sun is shining on. This is like daytime on earth. The dark part is in shadow, like night on earth. Now the moon goes around the earth once every 29 days (approximately). \\n\\nAt new moon, the moon and the sun are on the same side of Earth. We see the part of the moon that is in shadow, so the moon is dark. Then the moon moves around in its orbit. At first quarter, it has gone one-fourth of the way around Earth. Now we can see part of the moon that is sunlit, but part still in shadow. Note that if the sun is setting in the west, the bright part of the moon is on the side toward the sun and the dark part is away. \\n\\nAbout a week later, the moon has moved halfway around its orbit. Now it is on the opposite side of Earth, away from the sun. Now we see only the sunlit side — that is the full moon. Note that if the sun is setting in the west, the moon is just rising in the east. \\n\\nAbout a week later, the moon has moved now three-fourths of the way around in its circle around Earth. Once again only part of the moon is sunlit and part is dark. Now you can see the moon in the morning, and note that once again the sunlit side is on the side towards the sun, and the shadow side away. Another week and we are back to the new moon. \\n\\nIt's easier to demonstrate if you have a ball to represent the moon and a flashlight for the sun. Have someone stand several feet away, holding the flashlight so it shines on the bal",

As such, the crew was directed to make sure the first and second class passengers were attended to first. That wasn't right to do at all, but that's just how it was. \\n\\n(3) It's mainly the fault of the shipbuilders who only put 20 lifeboats on the ship, which wasn't enough for half the passengers. Sharing in the blame would have to be the officer who tried to turn the ship when it was too close already, since the ship wouldn't have sunk if it hit the iceberg head on. It was also the captain's fault for not taking the necessary precautions with the ship when he knew they were headed directly into an ice field.\\n\\n(4) The shipbuilders wanted as much \"ooh and ahh\" over the ship as they could get from the public. That's why they fostered the belief that the ship was \"unsinkable\", and that the ship itself was one big lifeboat. Those in charge also felt that the extra boats would have cluttered up the ship's deck. \\n\\n(5) They didn't prepare for this because they were arrogant and felt that they had the greatest ship in all of history and nothing would ever happen to it.\\n\\n(6) Greed is why people tried to take and sell Titanic artifacts. It was all about the $$$. \\n\\n(7) Titanic's victims are long-gone.

That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meagre and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were provided with safe-conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle.",

Each entrance has an additional six columns in front of it. The larger of the two interior rooms, the naos, housed the cult statue. The smaller room (the opisthodomos) was used as a treasury.\\n\\nSome historians believe that Athens concluded a peace treaty with Persia in 449, two years before work began on the Parthenon. The significance of this would be that the Delian League/Athenian Empire continued to exist, even after the reason for its existence (a mutual defense league against the Persians) had ceased to be valid. In other words it was now openly acknowledged that Athens was not just the head of the Greek defense league but actually an imperial master over other Greek states. The decision by the Athenians in 454 BC to move the League treasury from the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delos to the Athenian acropolis points in the same direction. Because the Parthenon was built with League funds, the building may be read as an expression of the confidence of the Athenians in this newly naked imperialism.",

Men and women, it seems, have this belief that they can \"please\" each other or \"make\" each other happy.  It is a nice thought, but it doesn't really happen that way.  Think about this, you are upset and your friend tells you a joke that makes you feel better...right?  Wrong.  You chose to feel better by seeing the humor in the joke and allowed yourself to open up enough to be influenced by the humor, losing your grip on those negative thoughts and feelings you had previously.  It is the same with women, in this case, your girlfriend.  \\n\\nYou can't satisfy her, but there is something you can do to improve the situation.  First start with you, being the best person you can be...to yourself, to others, and to her.  Be confident, be yourself, be all the things you want to be when fear and self-consiousness set in, and be true to who you are.  Then be selfless, helpful, caring, compassionate, diligent, and patient with those around you.  As for your girlfriend, you should follow your heart, care for her, give her yourself, be WITH her when you are around her, share, be thoughtful and kind, and show her that you care.  Although you cannot \"force\" or \"make\" her do anything, you can still be the best person possible, making each day you live worth living, making yourself a person of value, and creating a certain magic in your life.  All of these things will not only draw better people to you in your life, but your girlfriend will be more \"open\" to your influenc and \"willing\" to share whatever you wish with you.  \\n\\nA last note.  Women \"feel\" rather than \"think\" their ways into better relationships.  Men are mostly the other way.  If you love her and care for her, you should take the risk and tell her what is in your heart as often as you can, show her what you feel without the \"act\", and do for her what you would want done for yourself.  The best advice in any relationship, including the one you have with yourself, is this: \"If you don't want people to treat you like an @ssho!e, then don't act like one\".....in your case it would sound more like this \"If you want to satisfy her, then let her satisfy you\".  Do all the things to her that you want her to do to you (or have done to you, if you are content in the relationship).  Relationships are a balance, and if yours needs some adjustment, then make those adjustments.  Don't worry if you think you are working too hard, when she realizes what you are doing, she will be more than willing to do her part as well (if she is right for you, that is....and doing this will give you a good indicator if she is or isn't \"the one\"....)\\n\\nI hope this helped.

The two we are most familiar with are low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol). LDL is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol. It transports cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues -- depositing excess cholesterol on the walls of arteries to form artery-clogging \"plaques\" that contribute to the development of heart disease and stroke. You want to have less of this. \\n\\nIn contrast, HDL, or good cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the blood -- transporting it back to the liver, where it can be eliminated from the body. You want to have more of this type. \\n\\nFurthermore, the latest recommendations are that LDL levels ideally be below 100 -- a significant reduction from previous recommendations -- and that HDL levels be above 40, ideally over 60.",

The name \"chaos theory\" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data. \\nWhen was chaos first discovered? The first true experimenter in chaos was a meteorologist, named Edward Lorenz. In 1960, he was working on the problem of weather prediction. He had a computer set up, with a set of twelve equations to model the weather. It didn't predict the weather itself. However this computer program did theoretically predict what the weather might be. \\n\\nOne day in 1961, he wanted to see a particular sequence again. To save time, he started in the middle of the sequence, instead of the beginning. He entered the number off his printout and left to let it run. \\n\\nWhen he came back an hour later, the sequence had evolved differently. Instead of the same pattern as before, it diverged from the pattern, ending up wildly different from the original. (See figure 1.) Eventually he figured out what happened. The computer stored the numbers to six decimal places in its memory. To save paper, he only had it print out three decimal places. In the original sequence, the number was .506127, and he had only typed the first three digits, .506.   ...(c this site)",

At issue is to what does nine yards refer. The meaning is clearly the entirety or everything, but nine yards is not a significant measure of anything. All we know about its origin is that the phrase cannot be traced any earlier than the mid-1960s and that it is American in origin.\\n\\nPerhaps the most common assumption is that it is from American football, but the canonical distance in that game is ten, not nine, yards. Also common are explanations based on length of cloth, but there is no standard length for a bolt of cloth (which measure anywhere from twenty to twenty-five yards), and nine yards is not a significant measure for any type of garment (a man's suit uses about seven yards of a thirty-inch bolt, double folded; sarongs, saris, kilts, kimonos, bridal veils and any number of other garments have been suggested, none with any accompanying evidence).\\n\\nThe explanation that is currently circulating around the internet most frequently is that nine yards was the length of a belt of machine gun ammunition carried by a WWII fighter plane. To \"give it the whole nine yards\" was to expend all of one's ammo. This explanation is almost certainly false. For one thing, the type of fighter varies with the teller, sometimes Spitfires in the Battle of Britain, sometimes varying American fighters in the South Pacific. Another reason to doubt it is that ammunition is either counted in rounds or by weight. It is never measured in length of a belt. Chapman points to an origin in the Army and Air Force, which fits in with the post-WWII-era origin, but is otherwise unexplained.",

Coroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra.After the Trojan War, Cassandra is taken as a concubine and slave girl by King Agamemnon of Mycenae after being raped by Ajax. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, Clytemnestra asked her husband to walk across a purple carpet; he initially refused then gave in and entered, not believing Cassandra's warnings.

If we look at the ICC ODI Ranking Table then we would see that Australia is 1st and way ahead. But competition is strict from 2nd to 7th as South Africa is marginally ahead of Pakistan who is followed by India, England, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand. This shows how close these teams are when it comes to their standard of play and their consistency. It also means that from 2nd to 7th Position any team can beat its opponent (Even Australia, As New Zealand has just proved it by beating Australia in a record chase). So I think any of the Top Seven teams can won the World Cup on its day. Now a days ODI cricket has become so unpredictable that any thing can happen. \\n\\nComing back to the question, I would say that Aussies are favorites to defend their title but a bad day can stop their march towards a dream hat trick. Apart from Australia, every other team (i.e.; England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa) have equal chance to win the WC 2007. Any of the above mentioned team can make Aussies pay for their mistakes on the certain day. So, I would say that, India has equal chance of winning the World Cup 2007 as any other Top 7 team, with Aussies being the Favorites.",

            "input": "Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13, a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture. While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times, the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage, having been first coined by Coriat (1911; Simpson and Weiner 1992). It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8, 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee. \\n\\nThis superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13. In particular, this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1, 2, ..., 11, 12, 14, 15, ... (Sloane's A011760; the \"elevator sequence\"), omitting the number 13, in many high-rise American hotels, the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue, and so on. \\n\\nApparently, 13 hasn't always been considered unlucky. In fact, it appears that in ancient times, 13 was either considered in a positive light or (more commonly) not at all (Adams). The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus, although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times. \\n\\nThe association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars (such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles, while the solar Gregorian calendar  in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year. \\n\\nTriskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology, which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla, only to have his party crashed by Loki, the god of evil and turmoil, thus giving a total of 13 people. The legend goes on to related how Balder, one of the most beloved gods, tired to throw Loki out of the party, resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. \\n\\nFear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth  (a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia), despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century (\"and on a Friday fell all this misfortune\"), but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). In particular, it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture (beginning a journey, giving birth, getting married, moving, starting a new job, etc.) beginning around 1800 (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). \\n\\nWhile 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper, the Crucifixion took place on a Friday, thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day. Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, on Friday, October 13, 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). \\n\\nParaskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States, possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans. Interestingly, a study by Scanlon et al. (1993) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health, behavior, and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that, \"The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52%. Staying at home is recommended.\" \\n\\nWhile there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim, it has been suggested that $800 to $900 millio",

It is found in the cell nucleus in eukaryotes. All chromatin (except for that packaged in the sperm nucleus) consists of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes can be seen with an electron microscope as bead-like structures along the DNA.\\n\\n[edit]\\nStructure\\n \\nThe crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.The histones make up the central core particle of the nucleosome. The DNA is wrapped around this protein complex in 1.6 turns, comprising about 145 base pairs. Together with the DNA linking two nucleosomes, there are about 200 bps of DNA per nucleosome.\\n\\nNucleosomes are involved in processes ranging from compaction of DNA to transcriptional control, and appear to be major carriers of epigenetically inherited information as well. Repeating nucleosomes with intervening \"linker\" DNA form the 10-nm-fiber, known descriptively as \"beads on a string\", and have a packing ratio of ~6, compared to \"free\" DNA (per nm length). A chain of nucleosomes can be arranged in a 30-nm-fiber, a compacted structure (thought to be a helical solenoid, a zigzag ribbon structure, a superbead, or having no regular structure) with a packing ratio of ~40. The H1 histone stabilizes this structure. Beyond 30 nm fiber the structure of chromatin is poorly understood, but it is classically suggested that the 30 nm fiber is arranged into loops along a central protein scaffold to form transcriptionally active euchromatin. Further compaction leads to transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",

The term is a shortened form of weblog. Authoring a blog, maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called \"blogging\". Individual articles on a blog are called \"blog posts,\" \"posts,\" or \"entries\". The person who posts these entries is called a \"blogger\".\\n\\n    * Electronic communities existed before internetworking. For example the AP wire was, in effect, similar to a large chat room with \"wire fights\" and electronic conversations. Another pre-digital electronic community, amateur (or \"ham\") radio, allowed individuals who set up their own broadcast equipment to communicate with others directly. Ham radio also had logs called \"glogs\" that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s.\\n    * Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, e-mail lists and bulletin boards. In the 1990s Internet forum software, such as WebX, created running conversations with \"threads.\" Threads are topical connections between messages on a electronic \"corkboard.\" See \"Common terms,\" below.\\n    * Diarists kept journals on the Web: most called themselves online diarists, journalists, journallers, or journalers. A few called themselves escribitionists. The Open Pages webring contained members of the online-journal community. The first famous journaller was probably Justin Hall.\\n    * Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer John Carmack's widely read journal, published via the finger protocol.\\n    * Websites, including both corporate sites and personal homepages, had and still often have \"What's New\" or \"News\" sections, often on the index page and sorted by date.",

It does not mention the Chinese, but we do know that they existed at the same time as the ancient Hebrews.  If we look at the creation story in the eyes of the people that recorded it, we will find that in different sources, there are different, shall we say, interpretations of the story.  We know, because Christ said such, that he taught only in parables.  As the Son of God, we must accept that, as deity, he would not change.  He clearly states that he was the God of the Old Testament. Since he is unchangable, he must have taught by parable.  Until one accepts that much of the Old Testament contains many accounts that are symbolic in their meaning, such as the Book of Job, we must either see them as irrational explanations of the world (myths)or fairy tales.  Since many of us reject these explanations, we must decide that there is a rational reason for the way the things are told.  When we see the symbolic, hidden meanings within the story, then understanding and personal revelation, through prayer and deep contemplation can reach us.\\nWhen we look at the story of Genesis, we are not looking at a detailed description of the entire act of creation, merely a summary as explained to Moses.  However, the chronology of the events do, in fact, reflect the modern scientific explanation in a simple and to an ancient inhabitant, understandable manner of the creation of the earth.\\nThere are millions of animals, plants, and other things that are not mentioned in Genesis, but that does not mean that they did not exist.  But it does show that the planet had to be created before life could be.  Plant life proceeds animal life , which proceeds human existence.  In this, there is no disagreement with science.\\nAnother thing we must accept, when we carefully study the Bible is that much of it has been altered, lost or mistranslated.  this can lead to serious misunderstandings.",

The two surveyors who mapped the line, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, will always be known for their famous boundary.\\n\\nIn 1632, King Charles I of England gave the first Lord Baltimore, George Calvert, the colony of Maryland. Fifty years later, in 1682, King Charles II gave William Penn the territory to the north, which later became Pennsylvania. A year later, Charles II gave Penn land on the Delmarva Peninsula (the peninsula that includes the eastern portion of modern Maryland and all of Delaware).\\n\\nThe description of the boundaries in the grants to Calvert and Penn did not match and there was a great deal of confusion as to where the boundary (supposedly along 40° north) lay. The Calvert and Penn families took the matter to the British court and England's chief justice declared in 1750 that the boundary between southern Pennsylvania and northern Maryland should lie 15 miles south of Philadelphia. A decade later, the two families agreed on the compromise and set out to have the new boundary surveyed. Unfortunately, colonial surveyors were no match for the difficult job and two experts from England had to be recruited.\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon arrived in Philadelphia in November 1763. Mason was an astronomer who had worked at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and Dixon was a renowned surveyor. The two had worked together as a team prior to their assignment to the colonies.\\n\\nAfter arriving in Philadelphia, their first task was to determine the exact absolute location of Philadelphia. From there, they began to survey the north-south line that divided the Delmarva Peninsula into the Calvert and Penn properties. Only after the Delmarva portion of the line had been completed did the duo move to mark the east-west running line between Pennsylvania and Maryland.\\n\\nThey precisely established the point fifteen miles south of Philadelphia and since the beginning of their line was west of Philadelphia, they had to begin their measurement to the east of the beginning of their line. They erected a limestone benchmark at their point of origin.\\n\\nTravel and surveying in the rugged \"west\" was difficult and slow going. The surveyors had to deal with many different hazards, one of the most dangerous to the men being the indigenous Native Americans living in the region. The duo did have Native American guides although once the survey team reached a point 36 miles east of the end point of the boundary, their guides told them not to travel any farther. Hostile residents kept the survey from reaching its end goal. Thus, on October 9, 1767, almost four years after they began their surveying, the 233 mile-long Mason-Dixon had (almost) been completely surveyed.\\n\\nOver fifty years later, the boundary between the two states came into the spotlight with the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Compromise established a boundary between the slave states of the south and the free states of the north (however its separation of Maryland and Delaware is a bit confusing since Delaware was a slave state that stayed in the Union). This boundary became referred to as the Mason-Dixon line because it began in the east along the Mason-Dixon line and headed westward to the Ohio River and along the Ohio to its mouth at the Mississippi River and then west along 36° 30' North.\\n\\nThis line was very symbolic in the minds of the people of the young nation struggling over slavery and the names of the two surveyors who created it will evermore be associated with that struggle and its geographic association",

The Tao, in the broadest sense, is the way the universe functions, the path [Chin. tao=path] taken by natural events. It is characterized by spontaneous creativity and by regular alternations of phenomena (such as day following night) that proceed without effort. Effortless action may be illustrated by the conduct of water, which unresistingly accepts the lowest level and yet wears away the hardest substance. Human beings, following the Tao, must abjure all striving. The ideal state of being, fully attainable only by mystical contemplation, is simplicity and freedom from desire, comparable to that of an infant or an “uncarved block.”\\n\\nTaoist political doctrines reflect this quietistic philosophy: the ruler's duty is to impose a minimum of government, while protecting his people from experiencing material wants or strong passions. The social virtues expounded by Confucius were condemned as symptoms of excessive government and disregard of effortless action. Second only to Lao Tzu as an exponent of philosophical Taoism was Chuang-tzu, who wrote brilliant satirical essays. Taoist ideals greatly influenced Chinese literature, painting, and calligraphy. Later Taoism emphasized the techniques [Chin. te=power] for realizing the effects flowing from the Tao, especially long life and physical immortality.",

Most of the over-importance heaped on Hanukkah is due to its timing when comparing the Hebrew calendar to the Roman calendar. I personally find it ironic that the 25th of Kislev (the Hebrew calendar date for the first night of Hanukkah) is associated with the 25th of December (the Roman calendar date for the observance of Christmas). \\n\\nSo on to your specific question. There is no good answer why Christians do not celebrate Hanukkah. In the spirit of global tolerance and of coming together Christians may want to light a menorah to usher in the holiday time. After all there are an increasing number of Christians that celebrate the Passover holiday; even if it is likened to Christ's Last Supper which was undoubtably a Seder. \\n\\nOne of the most poignant discussions on the significance and relevance of Hanukkah to Christians is from Reverend Ricky Hoyt.

DS9 was darker and more spiritual, exploring the Bajoran civilization as well as the Gamma Quadrant with subtlety and grace.  It also had some great individual episodes, especially \"Far Beyond the Stars.\"  In my opinion, TNG at its best was better than DS9 at its best, but over the course of its entire seven seasons DS9 was better than TNG over the course of its entire seven seasons.  So I guess I'd have to call it a tie between TNG and DS9.",

Peter still has some doubts about the safety of the two of them engaging into a relationship and meets and befriends (in a way, his \"new\" best friend) astronaut Edward Brock (Topher Grace) who is the quite the comedian, often upsetting M.J. \\n\\nMeanwhile, M.J works to reconcile Peter's relationship with Harry Osborne who does not yet reveal that he's found out the secret about his father. Harry takes on more heavier drinking while putting on a false reconciliation with Peter by throwing a party for the both of them, there he meets Topher, I mean Eddie. Eddie says at one point in the film, \"I know I'm not a day older than you Peter... but I'm beginning to feel the astronaut life is weighing far too much for me. I'm thinking about retiring and maybe then you could find me a job as a reporter for the Daily Bugle\" which Peter happily looks forward to. Harry takes notice of the bond established between Eddie and Peter and begins feeling jealous - at the same time his schizophrenia about his father returning starts getting a stronger hold on him on a par with his alcoholism. \\n\\nEdward goes to M.J's apartment to look for Peter (whose off saving people from Sandman - whose not yet Sandman, just a common criminal by the name of Flint Marko) and M.J covers up for Peter. Eddie decides to leave his gift to Peter for saving him the other day (in a scene where Peter Parker (not Spider-man) saves him from a few Muggers. This scene is highly significant because after Peter saves Eddie, Ed comments on how not all of us have the innocence of comedy in ourselves - but to believe in that innocence, is a dream of mine) M.J asks Edward why can't he give it to Peter himself and Ed says he's got this huge expedition in space - his final \"lift off\" and he'll stay grounded for ever. \\n\\nThe gift happens to be an access pass to the Space station that corresponds to the transmission between NASA and the spacecrafts in orbit - this way Pete can contact Edward. Meanwhile, Flint Marko - takes on his pedestrian counter-part as William Baker - who works to scam Oscorp. Pete gives Harry some helpful intellectual strategies on how to counter Baker's plot to ruin him - Harry thanks him and they have a small sentimental talk as friends about why he killed his father. \\n\\nHarry asks Peter if he knew all along, and Peter says he didn't - not till the end. Peter then tries to reconcile any past issues between Harry and his father but Harry says the real Norman Osborne died regretting Peter Parker wasn't his son. Harry quickly apologizes for saying that by using his typsy-ness as an excuse. Peter understands Harry envys the life Peter's living, but Peter tells he would rather live a life without so many risks. Harry reassures he's always got him. Meanwhile, William Baker breaks into Harry's office later and finds the Goblin lair - he is directed by the Green Goblin in the form of Norman Osborne - Harry wasn't schizophrenic after all - to put some of the Performance Enhancing Syrum into Harry's alcoholic beverages - in return, Baker gets the location of a place where he can rob himself to riches. Peter and M.J go to the Space Station and they talk to Eddie from space. \\n\\nThis is the last friendly conversation Peter and Eddie ever engage in as they cheer off their happy anniversary until something goes horribly wrong - a substance they've gathered from one of the moon rocks has caused a combustion in the shuttle engine.

Except when they are spoken by Edson Arantes do Nascimento, the Brazilian genius known throughout the football world as Pele.\\n\\nA veteran of four World Cups, scorer of 1,283 first-class goals - 12 of them in World Cup final tournaments - a member of those magical Brazilian squads that won soccer's greatest prize in 1958, 1962 and 1970.\\n\\nBut just as a collection of notes do not make a Beethoven symphony, statistics cannot capture the majesty of those glorious Brazilian sides. This was football played to a samba beat. Beautiful skills, astonishing speed and ball control - and of all those great players in the yellow and green shirts, Pele was the greatest of them all.\\n\\nHe was lithe, agile, strong and seemed to be able to make the ball do as he pleased. Blessed with a stunning shot and an ability to soar above defences, he was expected to perform some astonishing feat of trickery every time he was in possession.\\n\\nAnd Brazil played such adventurous football, always attacking, constantly looking to score. Who can forget the rythmic chanting of their deliriously happy supporters? \"Bra-zil, cha cha cha, Bra-zil, cha cha cha.\"\\n\\nIt was the 1962 World Cup in Chile when those chants were heard for the first time in Europe on TV and British fans were quick to copy. First club names were shouted out, followed by a burst of clapping. Soon the strains of \"ee-ay-addeo\" echoed round Football League grounds.\\n\\nThree decades on, the chants may be different. But it was the Brazil of Pele which gave them to the world.\\n\\nPele was born in the poor district of Tres Coracoes in 1940. His father, known as Dondhino, was a footballer too, but an undistinguished one.\\n\\nPele was in love with football from the time he learned to kick a ball. But his mother was not so keen. Dondhino earned little money from the game and she wanted something better for her son. Had she got her way, football would have been denied one of its greatest talents.\\n\\nPele's precocious skill came to the attention of de Brito, a former Brazilian international who began to coach him. In 1954, aged 14, he joined Bauru Athletic Club juniors in Sao Paulo. At 16, despite a knee injury which was to trouble him throughout his career, he moved to Santos where he remained until 1974.\\n\\nTogether, Pele and Santos were to become legends, touring Europe and playing friendly matches. One of the British sides to entertain them was Sheffield Wednesday. As late as 1972, Pele turned out in his club's famous all-white strip to play one half in a goodwill visit to Hillsborough.\\n\\nIt was the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden which was to create the stage for Pele's genius. He was 17 and had won his first cap the previous year. He arrived in Sweden with an injury and was held back until Brazil's third and final group match against the Soviet Union in Gothenburg.\\n\\nBrazil won 2-0, Pele hit the post, laid on the second goal for Vava and a star had been born. The quarter-final was against Wales. Brazil only won 1-0. The scorer was Pele, his shot deflecting off Stuart Williams. It was his first World Cup goal - and he was to score six in a sequence of three games by the time the final was over.\\n\\nA hat-trick against France in the semi-final was followed by two goals against Sweden in the final. One of them, a breathtaking effort, was described by the football authority Brian Glanville in his book, The Story of the World Cup.\\n\\n\"Catching a high ball in the thick of the pen",

The undeniable evidence is that anger, anxiety and depression, on one hand, and love and intimacy on the other, affect health and recovery from illness. This findings have been elaborated by Dean Ornish MD in Love and Survival. The Scientific Basis for the Healing Power of Intimacy. (1997)  He writes: \\n\\n“…love and intimacy are at the root of what makes us sick and what makes us well... I am not aware of any factor in medicine -- not diet, not smoking, not stress, not genetics, not drugs, not surgery—that has greater  impact on our quality of life, incidence of illness and premature death from all causes.” \\n\\nYet, caring (love to be blunt,) which is presumed to be based on a mammalian instinct, strongly allied with survival is fraught with difficulties and is becoming increasingly difficult to exercise in our culture. Hoping to counteract these trends, I endeavor to teach people the simple, basic transactions that constitute the loving experience. This practice is based on three concepts: Strokes, The Stroke Economy and Opening the Heart. \\n\\nPuzzled by the difficulties that people have when exchanging strokes I came upon Wilhelm Reich’s concept of the \"sex economy,\" which he defined as the intentional squelching of sexual exchanges among German youth for the purpose of promoting conformity. I saw a similar inhibiting trend in our culture, applied to simple affection and love, and called it the \"stroke economy.\"\\n\\nThe stroke economy creates a scarcity of love and affection by imposing a set of rules that govern the exchange of strokes. \\n\\nThe rules of the stroke economy are:\\n\\nDon’t give strokes you would like to give.\\n\\nDon’t ask for strokes you would like to get. \\n\\nDon’t accept strokes you would like to accept.\\n\\nDon’t reject strokes you don’t want.\\n\\nDon’t give yourself strokes.\\n\\nThese rules are enforced internally and externally. Internally, by what we, in transactional analysis, call the inner Critical Parent. The Critical Parent is an ego state and as such it represents a network of ideas, acquired in childhood which deeply affect love of ourselves and others. These ideas can be seen as ingrained neural networks; \"limbic attractors\" that shape every emotional experience according to an archaic blueprint.\\n\\nWhile loving patterns are set in childhood, later relationships in which the person establishes a limbic resonance with another are capable of restructuring  the original design. Lewis et al conclude that permanent beneficial restructuring of a persons deeply ingrained limbic brain patterns is possible through long-term individual psychotherapy with a therapist who, for all intents and purposes, needs to be a paragon of limbic virtue.",

I thought that dude was an old word, but I thought wrong. I guess it's because the word sounds vaguely like duke, and all those titles of royalty are fairly ancient. But dude first appeared in print in 1878. The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang cites an 1877 reference in a letter--not published, however, until 1988--from the painter and sculptor Frederick Remington: \"Don't send me any more [drawings of] women or any more dudes.\" By 1883, dude was in wider circulation. In June of that year, its popularity was noted by Massachusetts’ North Adams Transcript: \"The new coined word 'dude'...has travelled over the country with a great deal of rapidity since but two months ago it grew into general use in New York.\" By 1885, it had established a strong enough foothold to appear in Ulysses S. Grant's Personal Memoirs: \"Before the car I was in had started, a dapper little fellow--he would be called a dude at this day--stepped in.\"\\n\\nFairly soon, a dude came to mean an Easterner or a city slicker, and especially someone who vacations on a ranch--thus dude ranch.\\n\\nDude also spawned quite a few odd derivatives, such as dudedom, dudeness, dudery, dudism, dudish, dudess and dudine--the last two meaning 'female dudes'. None of these is in general use today. I thought dudess might have had a revival as part of the surfer culture; however, Malia Alani of Surfer Magazine said no. She e-mailed me that \"I don't think there is a feminine word for dude. A traditional Hawaiian word used commonly for women surfers is wahine.\" (Note: following the appearance of the column, several readers have informed me that dudette is the feminine form of dude. A quick search of Nexis confirms the word is, in fact, current. Thanks, everyone.)\\n\\nThe meaning of the word as 'a male person' has been in wide use since the 1960's. This is from a 1968 book called College Drug Scene: \"And I got into symbolic logic and semantics with a cat who had studied with Korzybski and electronics from a dude who had an Associate of Arts degree in anthropology from 1941.\" The use of dude in direct address to a male began much earlier. This is from a 1945 book called Silversides: \"Hey, dude, there's a ship out here!\"\\n\\nThe origin of dude is uncertain. There are a few speculations, the most interesting of which, to my mind, is from A Dictionary of Slang by Eric Partridge. He says that it may have come from the word dud--which, at the time, meant 'a delicate weakling'--\"influenced by attitude.\"",

The people who are blocking the content only can tell that you went the the proxy site but will not know where you went using that. I have listed some below. You can also configure your computer to automatically use a proxy server. The directions to do this are below.\\n\\n1.On the Tools menu in Internet Explorer, click Internet Options, click the Connections tab, and then click LAN Settings.\\n\\n2.Under Proxy server, click to select the Use a proxy server for your LAN check box.\\n\\n3.In the Address box, type the IP address of the proxy server.\\n\\n4.In the Port box, type the port number that is used by the proxy server for client connections (by default, 8080).\\n\\n5.You can click to select the Bypass proxy server for local addresses check box if you do not want the proxy server computer to be used when you connect to a computer on the local network (this may speed up performance).\\n\\n6.Click OK to close the LAN Settings dialog box.\\n7.Click OK again to close the Internet Options dialog box.\\n\\n\\nThere are both anonymous proxies and ones that are not anonymous. Both will get you buy the \"firewall\" that you seem to have.  Using an anonymous proxy prevents the website that you are browsing from knowing who you are, they think that you are the proxy server.\\n\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \\nA proxy server is a computer network service that allows clients to make indirect network connections to other network services. A client connects to the proxy server, then requests a connection, file, or other resource available on a different server. The proxy provides the resource either by connecting to the specified server or by serving it from a cache. In some cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for various purposes.",

Of course, many states regulate such for minors, but few for workers over the age of 18.\\n\\nI've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks.  It's a pretty short list: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia.\\n\\nFor rest breaks, the list shrinks to California, Colorad, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.\\n\\nPerhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable.  Perhaps few regulate because unions, often providing the strongest labor law components in states, don't really care if non-unionized labor is forced to receive breaks, but really works hard to ensure that its own members are protected through contract agreements and bargaining.  Regardless, I hope this information helps.",

These are all quite abstract on the upper division level but often times an individual will have a higher aptitude in one or two over the others. I, for instance, found a fairly advanced abstract algebra course much easier than an introduction to analysis class. Also keep in mind that people that are drawn to math pure mathematics can usually get through the undergraduate material without too much difficulty. Individuals who are taking advanced mathematics courses to satisfy the requirements of some related program (education, engineering, business, etc) may find some of the more abstract material quite challenging. If your question pertains mostly to the latter case, then I'd just say that a good rule of thumb is that the difficulty of the course is probably directly proportional to the number prerequites. Differential Equations would probably be a good example since it should require about 3 semesters of calculus and linerar algrebra at least.",

Current is like the flow of water in a pipe and voltage is like the pressure causing the water to flow.  If you use the water to drive a hydraulic piston (say to hoist an automobile for repair) you can use either a small piston and high pressure or a larger piston and lower pressure.  Which is more cost effective?\\n\\nIn the United States, electric power is delivered to neighborhoods using three wires (three phases) strung along telephone (power) poles.  Only two of the wires are led to a single residence but the neighborhood must use all three wires to balance load on the wires.  Within a house electricity passes from only one wire (phase) to ground or earth to light a lightbulb which uses 110 volts.  The clothes dryer that needs far more power is connected between two of the supply wires (two phase) and to ground to supply 220 volts.  A machine shop might connect a very large motor to all three supply wires to obtain even more power at 440 volts.\\n\\nSix volts or even 12 volts DC in an automobile circuit can be touched with little danger.  It is less dangerous to accidentally touch a 110 volt AC wire than a 220 volt source and 440 volts is most dangerous.\\n\\nTherefore, the selection of voltage depends in part on safety and then on the size of the job to be tackled and also economic factors.  The higher the required current, the larger the required wires using expensive copper.  Increasing the voltage reduces the needed current and reduces the needed copper to do a given job.  The higher the required voltage, the more expensive the required electrical insulation will be.  Engineers must determine the best trade off of many factors.",

And to me the All has come.\"\\n(2) \"Split a piece of wood – I am there.\\n(3) Lift the stone, and you will find me there.\"\\n\\nThomas is a \"sayings gospel.\"  Unlike the Gospels that are in the Bible, it has no narrative.  It is just one Jesus quote after another.  Many scholars assign a first century date to Thomas, so it is at least possible that it is very old.\\n\\nGnostics believe that the material world is evil, and therefore God would never take the form of a man.  Gnostics have what is called a docetic view of Christ.  That is that he only appeared to be human, and had none of the actual physical characteristics of a human.  The goal of Gnostics is to escape the limitations and evil of this physical world and return to the spiritual world they believe we came from.\\n\\nGnosis.org is a great resource for gnostic information and has several copies of the Gospel of Thomas",

It makes and sells software, such as Windows and Office, to make money.  You usually buy their software in a store or indirectly when you purchase a new computer.\\n\\nLinux is not a company.  Linux is the name of the operating system (comparable to Microsoft's Windows).  No one company makes Linux.  The core of the Linux operating system is called the \"kernel\" (Microsoft has one too) and it is developed and maintained by volunteers.  That's right, volunteers that aren't paid for their work spend time creating Linux.  The companies you may have heard in the context of Linux like RedHat and Suse make money by taking the kernel that is freely available and packaging it in a manner that makes it easy to use and install - while also offering support if you need help.  These companies are less software makers like Microsoft and more like software support and packaging companies.  However, this is a very basic example - most of the Linux companies also have their development on top of the base operating system that provides a lot of value to the distribution.\\n\\nLinux also has some distributions (what the different versions of Linux are called) that are maintained solely by volunteers and are not sold but given away.  Debian is a great Linux distribution that does this as are Ubuntu, Slackware, Gentoo etc...  So, these are not Linux companies, but Linux communties as they do not exist to make money.\\n\\nIn summary, Linux is a type of operating system developed by a volunteer community while Microsoft is its own company that makes and sells software including the Windows Operating system and the Office productivity suite.",

The area was originally a swamp and was the habitat of swarms of flying insects otherwise known as gnats. Wealthy local landowner Lord Parham had the area drained in 1803 and the village that sprung up in this area became known as Gnat's Cross.

Contrary to much popular belief, these are not the twelve days before Christmas, but in most of the Western Church are the twelve days from Christmas until the beginning of Epiphany  (January 6th; the 12 days count from December 25th until January 5th). In some traditions, the first day of Christmas begins on the evening of December 25th but the following day is considered the First Day of Christmas (December 26th).\\n\\nThe origin of the Twelve Days is complicated, and is related to differences in calendars, church traditions, and ways to observe this holy day in various cultures (see Christmas).  In the Western church, Epiphany is traditionally celebrated as the time the three Wise Men or Magi arrived to present gifts to the young Jesus (Matt. 2:1-12). In some cultures, especially Hispanic and Latin American culture, January 6th is observed as Three Kings Day, or simply the Day of the Kings (Span: la Fiesta de Reyes, el Dia de los Tres Reyes, or el Dia de los Reyes Magos; Dutch: Driekoningendag).  Even though December 25th is celebrated as Christmas in these cultures, January 6th is often the day for giving gifts. In some places it is traditional to give Christmas gifts for each of the Twelve Days of Christmas. Since Eastern Orthodox traditions use a different religious calendar, they celebrate Christmas on January 7th and observe Epiphany or Theophany on January 19th.\\n\\nBy the 16th century, some European and Scandinavian cultures had combined the Twelve Days of Christmas with (sometimes pagan) festivals celebrating the changing of the year. These were usually associated with driving away evil spirits for the start of the new year. \\n\\nThe Twelfth Night is January 5th, the last day of the Christmas Season before Epiphany (January 6th). In some church traditions, January 5th is considered the eleventh Day of Christmas, while the evening of January 5th is still counted as the Twelfth Night, the beginning of the Twelfth day of Christmas the following day.  Twelfth Night often included feasting along with the removal of Christmas decorations. French and English celebrations of Twelfth Night included a King's Cake, remembering the visit of the Three Magi, and ale or wine (a King's Cake is part of the observance of Mardi Gras in French Catholic culture of the Southern USA).  In some cultures, the King's Cake was part of the celebration of the day of Epiphany. \\n\\nThe popular song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is usually seen as simply a nonsense song for children. However, some have suggested that it is a song of Christian instruction dating to the 16th century religious wars in England, with hidden references to the basic teachings of the Faith.  They contend that it was a mnemonic device to teach the catechism to youngsters. The \"true love\" mentioned in the song is not an earthly suitor, but refers to God Himself. The \"me\" who receives the presents refers to every baptized person who is part of the Christian Faith. Each of the \"days\" represents some aspect of the Christian Faith that was important for children to learn.\\n\\nHowever, many have questioned the historical accuracy of this origin of the song The Twelve Days of Christmas.  It seems that some have made an issue out of trying to debunk this as an \"urban myth,\" some in the name of historical accuracy and some out of personal agendas.  There is little \"hard\" evidence available either way.  Some church historians affirm this account as basically accurate, while others point out apparent historical discrepancies. However, the \"evidence\" on both sides is mostly in logical deduction and probabilities.  One internet site devoted to debunking hoaxes and legends says that, \"there is no substantive evidence to demonstrate that the song 'Th",

The inflammation is usually caused by bacteria or viruses (viral meningitis is also called aseptic meningitis). Less common causes include fungi, protozoa, and other parasites. Sometimes certain medications, cancers, or other diseases can inflame the meninges, although such noninfectious cases of meningitis are much rarer.\\n\\nMany of the bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis are fairly common and are more often associated with other everyday illnesses. Sometimes, however, they spread to the meninges from an infection in another part of the body. The infection can start anywhere, including in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary system, but the most common source is the respiratory tract. From there the microorganisms can enter the bloodstream, travel through the body, and enter the central nervous system. In some cases of bacterial meningitis, the bacteria spread directly to the meninges from a severe nearby infection, such as a serious ear infection (otitis media) or nasal sinus infection (sinusitis). Bacteria may also enter the central nervous system after severe head trauma or head surgery. \\n\\nBacterial meningitis is less common than viral meningitis but is usually much more serious and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Many different types of bacteria can cause meningitis: Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes are the most common causes of meningitis in newborns. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) are more frequent in children older than 2 months of age. Before the 1990s, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading cause of meningitis in children in the United States. But the widespread use of the Hib vaccine as a routine childhood immunization has dramatically decreased the frequency of meningitis caused by Hib.\\n\\nViral meningitis is relatively common and far less serious than bacterial meningitis. It often remains undiagnosed because its symptoms are similar to those of the common flu. The frequency of viral meningitis increases slightly in the summer and fall months because people are more often exposed to common viral agents during those seasons. Most cases of viral meningitis are associated with enteroviruses - viruses that typically cause stomach \"flu.\" However, many other types of viruses, such as the herpes virus, can also cause meningitis. The mumps virus was once a common cause of viral meningitis, but it is now rare due to the routine use of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\\n\\nBacterial meningitis occurs in people of all ages but is more common in the very young (infants and young children) and the elderly (people above age 60). Teenagers and college students are also slightly more at risk for the disease because of time spent in close contact with many of their peers. Viral meningitis occurs in people of all ages, although it is more common in children.\\n\\nPeople with less competent immune systems, such as the very young or those whose immune systems have been compromised by disease, are more at risk for all types of meningitis. Some types are more common in child-care centers, boarding schools, dormitories, and military bases, mainly because infectious diseases tend to spread quickly among large groups of people. Not receiving routine vaccines for certain infectious agents that can cause meningitis - including those for mumps, Hib, and pneumococcus - also increases a person's risk for the disease.\\n\\nThe long-term outlook for children who develop meningitis varies greatly and depends on a child's age, the microorganism causing the infection, any other complications, and the treatment the child receives. The complications of bacterial meningitis can be severe and include neurological problems such as hearing loss, visual impairment, seizures, and learning disabiliti",

Psychiatry defines these traits as a \"mental illness\", and promotes it as a \"disease\" that requires \"treatment\".\\n\\nIt is not a \"disease\", despite claims or implications made by certain psychiatric or pharmaceutical organisations. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes \"bipolar\" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or \"chemical imbalance\".\\n\\n\"For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign.\" Fred Baughman, MD., Neurologist & Pediatric Neurologist.\\n\\n\"Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea.\" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\\n\\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as \"bipolar\" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people, for example, have overcome \"bipolar\" through megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including symptoms labelled as \"schizophrenia\" [See source refs]\\n\\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a \"faith\", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called \"research\" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that \"schizophrenia\" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\\n\\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit:\\n\\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\\n\\nFor information on non-drug / alternative approaches:\\n- http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#B\\n- http://www.pendulum.org/articles/articles_misc_lisaalt.html\\n- http://www.truehope.com/_empowerplus/empowerplus.asp\\n- http://www.mentalhealthproject.com/content.asp?id_Content=1575",

In this method each letter has an arithmetic value assigned to it from one to one thousand. The letters are arranged in the following order: Abjad, Hawwaz, Hutti, Kalaman, Sa'fas, Qarshat, Sakhaz, Zazagh. This arrangement was done, most probably in the 3rd century of Hijrah during the 'Abbasid period, following other Semitic languages such as Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldean etc.\\n\\nIf you take the numeric values of all the letters of the Basmalah, according to the Abjad order, the total will be 786. In the Indian subcontinent the Abjad numerals became quite popular. Some people, mostly in India and Pakistan, use 786 as a substitute for Bismillah. They write this number to avoid writing the name of Allah or the Qur'anic ayah on ordinary papers. This tradition is not from the time of the Prophet -peace be upon him- or his Sahabah.

Operating system manufacturers often recommend periodic defragmentation in order to keep hard drive access as fast as possible.\\n\\nFragmented data also spreads over more disk than it needs.

There is no certification out there that can replace experience.  \\n\\nMicrosoft has a few levels of certification.  The more prestigious is the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE).

I have an MCSE in Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows 2003.  I also have my Cisco CCNP.  While these certifications certainly help my consulting firm w/ their Cisco and Microsoft partnerships, it doesn't do much for one's salary if you don't have the experience to match.  Certifications aren't difficult to come by and you get a lot of people coming into the market w/ Certs out the wazoo w/ no real experience.  \\n\\nSorry to rant, but I just want you to know the truth.  Don't go paying $4000, or however much, to attend a course to get an MCSE at a school because they tell you that you can land a sweet job w/ the cert.  These certification \"mills\" will fill your head full of dreams that will end up getting you burned while padding their pockets.  \\n\\nWith that said, if you are willing to put the money and effort into getting a certification w/ the realization that you'll have to take a few modest jobs to start out then that's a different story.  \\n\\nIf you're not already in the IT business then think long and hard about it before you go in.  A lot of people think that just because they like computers that they'll automatically like a job in computers.  The IT industry is very tough and fast paced.

The government has been an earlier witness to the innovator's model and is responsile for its protection.\\n\\nAnother thing, you can sign a non disclosure aggrement with any party with whom you show the invention.\\n\\nIn case you are giving it in the public domain, I suggest you go to the appropriate officials in your country and do ask for some monetary benifits as you wish, looking at the benefit it will give to the common masses.",

It was known to the original natives as \"Mitzi-a-dazi,\" the \"River of Yellow Rocks,\" because of the hydrothermally altered iron-containing yellow rocks in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (many people incorrectly believe that the yellow color is from sulfur).\\n\\nThe Native Americans that hunted and fished in the Yellowstone region also utilized the significant amounts of obsidian found in the park to make cutting tools and weapons. In fact, arrowheads made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the Mississippi Valley, which strongly indicate that a regular obsidian trade existed between Yellowstone Native Americans and tribes further east.\\n\\n Lower Yellowstone FallIn 1806 a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition named John Colter left the Expedition to join a group of fur trappers and was probably the first non-Native American to visit the region and make contact with the Native Americans there. After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with Crow and Blackfoot tribes, he gave a description of a place of \"fire and brimstone\" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed \"Colter's Hell.\"\\n\\nMountain man Jim Bridger later returned from an 1857 expedition to the park's area and told tales of boiling springs, spouting water, a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored, however, because Bridger was known for being a \"spinner of yarns.\" Nonetheless his stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist F.V. Hayden who in 1859 started a two-year survey of the upper Missouri River region with Bridger as a guide and with United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds. The party was able to reach the approaches to the Yellowstone region but was not able to go any further due to heavy snows. The intervening American Civil War stopped all attempts to explore the region, and Hayden would not be able to fulfill his mission to explore the area for another 11 years.\\n\\n North Gate to Yellowstone Park at Gardiner, Montana, which says \"For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.\"A party of Montanans then organized the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition, headed by the surveyor-general of Montana Henry Washburn. Amongst the group was Nathaniel P. Langford, who would later become known as \"National Park\" Langford, and an Army detachment commanded by Lt. Gustavus Doane. The expedition spent about a month in 1870 exploring the region, collecting specimens and naming sites of interest.\\n\\nIn 1871 Hayden led a second, larger expedition, which was now government sponsored, to the Yellowstone region. He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone which included large-format photographs by William Henry Jackson and paintings by Thomas Moran. This report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction. Then on March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill into law that created Yellowstone National Park.\\n\\nLangford then served for five years without pay as the first superintendent of the park and was followed by several other superintendents (who worked with some minimal funding). The second superintendent was Philetus Norris who essentially volunteered for the position, after traveling through Yellowstone and witnessing its problems first hand. During his tenure Congress finally began to give the superintendent a salary and minimal funds to operate the park. He used these monies to expand access to and further explore Yellowstone. Norris also hired Harry Yount (nicknamed \"Rocky Mountain Harry\") to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the very first national park ranger.\\n\\n Mammoth Hot SpringsThree additional superintendents followed, but none proved effective in stopping the destruction of Yellowstone's natural resources.\\n",

For instance, the Babylonian exorcism consisted of the formation and eventual destruction of a clay doll fashioned in the shape of the demon.  Supposedly, with the destruction of the doll the Devil or demon would be forced from the mortal body.  Many cultures and religions practice the act of exorcism to this day.

I think this is mainly caused by the change to carver skis which cut the snow differently to the old straight skis.  Also boarders have to take some of the blame as they really cut the surface up and seem to scrape the snow around and they tend to cut the top off of the hump as they go over them.\\n\\nPersonally i hate these low long humps as they are not as much fun to ski.",

The venue, speed and technical difficulty associated with the sport can lead to collisions, accidents, hypothermia and other serious injury or illness, including death. Regional Ski Patrol organizations, such as the National Ski Patrol in the U.S., exist as a voluntary organization to provide guidance, help, medical assistance and emergency rescue to those in need of it.\\n\\nMany non-skiers wonder why skiers are willing to risk such injury. Skiers have a variety of answers to this question, but a common explanation is that it simply feels good, rather like flying, and that, when done carefully, poses no greater risk of injury compared to other sports. Of course, there is some aspect of danger, but that is part of the appeal. Skiing is the fastest means of land transport possible without mechanical assistance. Many skiers have had experiences where they have achieved a union of the mind and the body by practicing this sport; where the mind trusts the body to perform in an exceptional manner and the body trusts the mind not to lead it off an un-navigable cliff. A sense of harmony and of peak experience can result in a feeling of wholeness of self.\\n\\nIn addition to their role in recreation and sport, skiing is also used as a means of transport by the military, and many armies train troops for ski warfare. Ski troops played a key role in retaining Finnish independence from Russia during the Winter War, and from Germany during the Lapland War, although the use of ski troops was recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The sport of Biathlon was developed from military skiing patrols.",

Today, scientific education and experience are equally important prerequisites in selecting both pilots and mission specialists.\\n\\nPilot astronauts play a key role in Shuttle flights, serving as either commanders or pilots. During flights, commanders are responsible for the vehicle, the crew, mission success and safety -- duties analogous to those of the captain of a ship. Shuttle commanders are assisted by pilot astronauts who are second in command and whose primary responsibilities involve controlling and operating the Shuttle. During flights, commanders and pilots usually assist in spacecraft deployment and retrieval operations using the RMS arm or other payload-unique equipment on board the Shuttle. \\n\\nMission Specialist Astronauts\\n\\nMission specialist astronauts, working closely with the commander and pilot, are responsible for coordinating on board operations involving crew activity planning, use and monitoring of the Shuttle's consumables (fuel, water, food, etc.), and conducting experiment and payload activities. They are required to have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems and the \"operational characteristics, mission requirements and objectives and supporting systems for each of the experiments to be conducted on the assigned missions.\" Mission specialists perform on-board experiments, spacewalks (called extravehicular activity (EVA) and payload handling functions involving the RMS arm. \\n\\nPayload Specialists\\n\\nThis newest category of Shuttle crew member, the payload specialist, is a professional in the physical or life sciences or a technician skilled in operating Shuttle-unique equipment. Selection of a payload specialist for a particular mission is made by the payload sponsor or customer. For NASA-sponsored spacecraft or experiments requiring a payload specialist, the specialist is nominated by an investigator working group and approved by NASA.",

The center of gravity for a sphere (like the Earth) is the geometric center of the shpere and at any point on the sphere, a straight line could pass from the center of the sphere, through your feet and through your head when you are standing erect.  Because the curvature of the Earth is hard to detect where you stand, you sense that you are standing perpendicular to the ground.\\n\\nThe center of gravity of an Earth-sized cube would also be the geometric center of the cube.  However a cube has six sides and the very center of each side would be the only six places on the cube where you could stand erect perpendicular to the surface.  At any other point, especially as you approach an edge or corner, a straight line should pass through the center of the cube, your feet and your head, but you would be standing erect at an angle to the surface.  Right on the edge, a straight line could pass throught the center of the cube, the edge, your feet and your head as you stand erect relative to gravity.  As you step over an edge, the slope of the angle would begin to tilt the opposite way as you leave the edge toward the center of the next side.\\n\\nThere is an interesting point that when the British performed the original land surveys of India near Mt. Everest, the results were in error because they neglected to account for the gravitational pull of the mountain that affected perpendicularity of their plumb bob.  This effect might also create an abberation near the edges and corners of your cube.  At any rate, you would stand erect parallel to any plumb bob that you held.",

I would suggest looking in your community for a community program that would involve your son in some activities that might be a precursor to job/studies.

Call your local mental health association, ask your psychiatrist, or call the local mental health center for a referral to a rehabilitation program. \\n\\nHang in there as this is a long-term problem with which you must deal.

In a BBC interview he stated that the song chronicled his experiences in mental institutions and the suicide of a friend. More recently, on the VH1 series Story Tellers, Taylor said that the song was, indeed, about Suzanne MacKenzie, a friend of his who died suddenly while he was away from home. According to that account, he had been in a deep depression after the failure of his new band \"Flying Machine\" to coalesce (the lyric includes a reference to \"sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground\"; the reference is to the name of the band rather than a fatal plane crash, as was long rumored). As he was wondering what to do with himself, he received word of MacKenzie's death, and the song explains that her death was a check for his own worries, a way of realizing the transience of life and his need to get back to his old friends. In other interviews Taylor has also indicated that a battle with drug addiction figured into the song.\\n\\nThe song was originally written several years before its release and was refined over time; it appears probable that all the elements referenced by Taylor over time went into the final version.",

A spoof is when someone changes thier computers MAC address to your address and attempts to gain access to your netwrok via this mac address. Yes public and private keys can help. Authentication is the only hope you have against mac address spoofing. EXAMPLE: A wireless router that is set up for access control looks at 3 things, the mac address, the computer name and a key (128 bit or cyphered) for authentication. If someone gets a mac and computer name of a system already authenticated to join the routers network the only thing keeping this computer from accessing your router is the keys. Preferably encryted keys. If you are talking crytography that would partain to, um, what, emails and that type of thing? Unless you are trying to trace a mac addy in en email address that is. Regardless of why u are tracking the mac addy, the use of keys for authentication of whatever the source is can possibly be the last line of defence to ensure the communication is from who it says it is supposed to be. but keep in mind that if someone, other than the person or computer who is legitimently supposed to have the keys, has the computer name and mac address you can probably bet that this person has the keys as well. If you think you are beeing mac spoofed and using keys, change the keys immeditely after the threat has been detected. This is only my opinion and not gospel, but i think it to be correct. Sometimes real world assesments look very different from text book assesments and the work around is totally different as well.

When a ball leaves the playing area, it effectively becomes abandoned property of Major League Baseball, which is why fans who catch a ball that leaves the playing area may keep it. In a similar sense, then, I think that Major League Baseball has abandoned its property when the ball ends the World Series. That ball is scuffed and cannot be used later, and it has a particular insignia that cannot be used in any other game. I think the rule of abandonment is not limited exclusively to leaving the arena, but that's debatable, and perhaps the kicker.\\n\\nOnce Mientkiewicz takes the ball, he possess abandoned proprety and may do as he wishes with it.

User le_penseur\\n\\nOk. There are a couple obvious answers that everyone gives--number 1: how can a good God exist with bad stuff happening? [I think it's interesting that people always assume that if God exists, he's good. I tend to agree with them--if God isn't good, he's just a really big version of us, right?)\\nnumber 2: How can life exist without God? [that's a pro-God argument, just to clarify.] So, to deal with both answers...number one is pretty interesting. I think the answer (if one can honestly be written!) has a few parts to it. First, bad stuff happens because bad people do it. Murders require murderers. So...why does God [if he exists] allow people to do bad stuff? Or, why are bad people allowed to exist under an all-powerful God? If we assume there is a God, than the answer is a very interesting answer indeed--FREE CHOICE, under an all-powerful God. We have the right to make our lives better, or worse. With the assumption of a good God, and the evidence of a bad world, the conclusion is that we've chosen to go for the worse, and everyone suffers [but then, nobody's perfect, so everyone contributes to everyone else's suffering, too. Not a very pretty picture, but there's at least some truth in it. I'll let you decide how much.]\\nAnswer number two is pretty controversial these days [most things are.] So. Can life exist without God? I've heard evolution and intelligent design theories. Many people find intelligent design insulting to their intelligence. I like an awful lot of evolution, but it just doesn't answer all of my questions. How did the eyeball manage to evolve from a series of small, random steps? Each part is dependent on the other, they don't just blossom out in complexity from a simple, functioning core structure. I'm not saying I don't believe in evolution--there's evidence it works. I just don't think it works universally. So--does that mean intelligent design is the answer? Hm...not necessarily. A lack of knowledge is not proof of impossibility. But I wouldn't rule it out. Does intelligent design, or--dare I say it--guided evolution, prove the existence of God? I wouldn't say it proves the existence of God. I would say it presents some very interesting questions. Ultimately, everyone really does have to decide for themselves. Scientifically, the Universe is a big place with a lot of unanswered, and possibly unanswerable, questions. God is an awfully big explanation. Spiritually, from the point of assuming God exists, what God asks for is Faith. He says so in the Bible (yes, I'm operating from an incriminatingly Western view point. Cut me some slack.) So, you've got to decide for yourself. You probably guessed this already, but yes, I believe in God. A friend of mine suggested that what improved my life and what I prayed to was really the better side of me that I didn't believe existed and therefore projected as God. I found the idea rather interesting and talked it over with God a few times before deciding He really was God, but like I said--a lot of these things really tie into faith. Thank you for a VERY interesting question, and I'm sorry for a VERY long answer. Tell me what you think. \\n\\n2.User Soham\\n\\nIt's seem to be a interesting question. Personaly, I think GOD exist. When Newton gave the law of gravational force or other astrnomy laws. Neither he nor we saw the graviational force but we feel the effect of gravitational force. If the certain things does not see it doesn't mean that this things doesn't exit. As we know that in our environment water molecules are exist but we cannot see. If we want to see we have to apply some procedure. \\n\\nIf you want to see the GOD you c",

However, offlate, I have started losing faith in Google, especially because their objectives and goals as a company seem very unclear. A chunk of their revenue still comes through ads, and their search engine is really the only intellectual property they have developed from the ground-up, otherwise everything else is either just an acquisition or a bad idea. Google earth was previously keynote, Google Talk has been built upon Jabber which is an open source technology for messaging and these were the \"other\" great ideas besides the search engine, but things like web accelerators and secure connection through VPN are just lame excuses to drive internet traffic through their servers.\\n\\nAnother great idea from Google was desktop search, but somehow they never capitalized on the idea, and today MSN has come out tops in this department.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Google isnt running out of ideas, I think they are running out of focus, something that companies like Yahoo have and very well defined ones at that.",

They are more concerned with dividing classes in this counrty. Look at the issues that effect you everyday and tell me what a democrat has done for you lately. They are more concerned with promising the world to the poor and to minorities. They like to bring race and ethniticity into their issues, when in reality they don't want to bring people together and have everyone be equal, it takes away their base. It's a proven fact that young people, minorities and the poor are the base voters for democrats. The democrats promise to bring new hope to these people, but they don't do anything for them. They try to bring race and class warfare into everything. Once most young people get older they switch their beliefs and begin to become conservative. When minorities and immigrants get good jobs and start businesses they become conservative. The democrats have nothing to offer working class people. I live in a very liberal state and we have elected republican governors for the last 5 years. We went from a 4.5 billion dollar defecit to having a 500 million dollar surplus without doing the old democratic action of raising taxes. I am middle class. My family household income is only $40,000 ( to some democrats I'm in the top 10%) The democrats have done nothing for me. I have the heaviest tax burden, my kids won't get any aid for college, I don't have any laws that place me at the head of the line for a job. Please let me know what a democrat has done for you lately. There aren't many working class democrats out there anymore. Last one I can think of that really cares about the common man is Sen Joe Liberman. The democratic party doesn't care about defending our country. If they had thier way we would sit back let people attack us and fire a missile into an abandoned camp in the Sudan and say \"we're even\". They are more concerned about the rights of our enemies than the people of this nation. Listening to people like Howard Dean and John Kerry would make me embarressed to be a democrat. The democrats are the most negative party I have seen, they feast on dividing this nation. Ever since the 2000 election they have been out to ruin Bush. Is Bush a great president? He's not the greatest, but far, far from the worst. The democrats will sit back and say that Bush lied about WMD's in Iraq, but fail to remember that for 8 years, Clinton, Gore, Albright, Cohen all made the same claims and talked about how Iraq possesing WMD's was the most dangerous situation in the world. How soon we forget, because we have to attack the president for political gains. So far it isn't working so good. Please tell me what president has gone through what Bush has gone through. In his first 5 years in office. Our country was attacked. The worse attack by a foreign entity in our history. We found that there are thousand of Islamic extremist living in this country and they want to kill us. The threat of the next attack could be tem times worse then what 9/11 brought. We have gone to war in Afghanastan, Iraq, and countless other places we don;t even know about to fight terroism. We have an extremist movement in this world that is very strong that wants to destroy the way of life of the western world. Not just America, the Western World!!. They will stop at nothing to do so. Bush has had to deal with countless natural disasters that we have never experienced before in such great frequency. He has had to deal with the greatest divide this country has seen since the Civil War. He was handed a downward spiral economy that we found was over inflated in the 90's by greedy companies that were cooking the books, and the economy was only made worse by the 9/11 attacks.",

This is just like other ports, like LPT1, LPT2, COM1, COM2, etc. If you managed to created such a file/folder on your machine, all normal input and output that normally come from the keyboard and display on the screen would have to come from and go to the file/folder you created.\\n\\nDOS device names are reserved words, and cannot be\\nused as folder or file names. When parsing a reference to a file or folder, Windows correctly checks for the case in which a single DOS device name is used in the path, and treats it as invalid.\\n\\nfollowing are reserved device names\\n\\nCON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4,\\nCOM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4,LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.\\n\\nu cannot create a folder or file of the above names.\\n\\nThis actually is a unix-like feature. DOS device drivers are accessible like normal files, i.e. the everything-is-a-file philosophy. CON is the equivalent of /dev/tty, NUL of /dev/null, COM# of /dev/ttyS#, LPT# of /dev/lp# and CLOCK$ corresponds to /dev/rtc (PRN is an alias to LPT1, AUX is COM1). Every character device can be opened this way, block devices (which are assumed to be FAT formatted...) are named A: to Z:, as you will know. Many pseudo character devices (drivers which had to be loaded as drivers but were no character devices, like EMM386, HIMEM.SYS, ..) had forbidden characters like '*' in their device names to be hidden from the user.\\n\\nThe only problem is: DOS 1, which introduced CON, NUL, PRN and AUX had no directories, i.e. no /dev/, so for compatibility with old DOS1-executables (which don't know that they live in a directory) the character devices have to exist in every directory. Don't know why this feature was not limited to FCB (CP/M like) file access, unix like file numbers were introduced together with directories in DOS 2 (actually the MS programmers had Xenix machines on their desks, I heard)..\\n\\nsecondly i would say that some extra smart people try to create the Folder \"con\" by using special characters in front of the folder name such as now take for example one of my friend told me that he had created the folder \"con\". he showed me the syntax. the correct syntax for creating a folder in DOS is...\\n\\nmkdir con \\n\\nbut since the folder \"con\" cannot be created this command doesnt execute.\\nnow see the syntax what my friend showed me\\n\\nmkdir &#92;.&#92;&#92;d:&#92;con  (warning : dont try on ur pc)\\nand to delete the folder is\\nrd &#92;.&#92;&#92;d:&#92;con\\nu know wat will happen\\nin windows xp u will c only a folder of name \"con\" but  the actual name is &#92;.&#92;&#92;con\\nwe should not use special character in front of folder names.\\n\\nThere is one more technique to create \"con\" but it is not known to most of the people.\\nThis is the alt+255 technique.\\nIn this the user holds the \"alt\" key and then presses 255 from the numpad before or after the folder name.\\nBut alt + 255 is the keyboard combination of underscore(_) or space which is a special character and hence can't be used for folder name.\\nWhile displaying the name it wont show the special character, it will show only the name \"con\"\\n\\nNow regarding the file \"con\"\\nyou may not have noticed but it is not only the folder \"con\" cannot be created but also u cannot create a file of name \"con\" (such as u can't create \"con.txt\",\\n\"con.doc\",\"con.ppt\" etc...)\\nThe reason for this is as follows\\n\\nIn Dos there are two commands \\nfor creating a file we use a command \"copy con\"\\nthe syntax for creating a file in DOS is..\\n\\ncopy con <filename>\\n\\nusing the above command u can create a file in DOS.\\nnow for copyng a file the command is \"copy\" in Dos\\nthe synatx is ..\\n\\ncopy <filename1> <filename2&gt",

            "input": "The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859. He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red. This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in. From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank. The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\\n\\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later. He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles. It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.\\n\\nDust or Molecules?\\nTyndall and Rayleigh thought that the blue colour of the sky must be due to small particles of dust and droplets of water vapour in the atmosphere. Even today, people sometimes incorrectly say that this is the case. Later scientists realised that if this were true, there would be more variation of sky colour with humidity or haze conditions than was actually observed, so they supposed correctly that the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the air are sufficient to account for the scattering. The case was finally settled by Einstein in 1911, who calculated the detailed formula for the scattering of light from molecules; and this was found to be in agreement with experiment. He was even able to use the calculation as a further verification of Avogadro's number when compared with observation. The molecules are able to scatter light because the electromagnetic field of the light waves induces electric dipole moments in the molecules.\\n\\nWhy not violet?\\nIf shorter wavelengths are scattered most strongly, then there is a puzzle as to why the sky does not appear violet, the colour with the shortest visible wavelength. The spectrum of light emission from the sun is not constant at all wavelengths, and additionally is absorbed by the high atmosphere, so there is less violet in the light. Our eyes are also less sensitive to violet. That's part of the answer; yet a rainbow shows that there remains a significant amount of visible light coloured indigo and violet beyond the blue. The rest of the answer to this puzzle lies in the way our vision works. We have three types of colour receptors, or cones, in our retina. They are called red, blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths. As they are stimulated in different proportions, our visual system constructs the colours we see.\\n\\n\\nResponse curves for the three types of cone in the human eye\\n\\nWhen we look up at the sky, the red cones respond to the small amount of scattered red light, but also less strongly to orange and yellow wavelengths. The green cones respond to yellow and the more strongly-scattered green and green-blue wavelengths. The blue cones are stimulated by colours near blue wavelengths which are very strongly scattered. If there were no indigo and violet in the spectrum, the sky would appear blue with a slight green tinge. However, the most strongly scattered indigo and violet wavelengths stimulate the red cones slightly as well as the blue, which is why these colours appear blue with an added red tinge. The net effect is that the red and green cones are stimulated about equally by the light from the sky, while the blue is stimulated more strongly. This combination accounts for the pale sky blue colour. It may not be a coincidence that our vision is adjusted to see the sky as a pure hue. We have evol",

However, only user settings appear in the Internet Options. For example, when this DWORD value does not exist or is set to 0, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE settings are read along with HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings, but only HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings appear in the Internet Options.\\nNote With the Security_HKLM_only policy enabled, HKLM values will be used by Internet Explorer, but the HKCU values will still be displayed in the zone setting tab within the Internet Explorer Interface. This is by design, and there are no plans to change this functionality at this time. \\nTemplatePolicies\\nThe TemplatePolicies key determines the settings of the default security zone levels (Low, Medium Low, Medium, and High). You can change the security level settings from the default settings. However, you cannot add additional security levels. The keys contain values that determine the setting for the security zone. Each key contains a Description string value and a Display Name string value that determine the text that appears on the Security tab for each security level. \\nZoneMap\\nThe ZoneMap key contains the following keys: • Domains \\n• ProtocolDefaults \\n• Ranges \\nThe Domains key contains domains and protocols that have been added to change their behavior from the default behavior. When a domain is added, a key is added to the Domains key. Subdomains appear as keys under the domain where they belong. Each key that lists a domain contains a DWORD with a value name of the affected protocol. The value of the DWORD is the same as the numeric value of the security zone where the domain is added.\\n\\nThe ProtocolDefaults key specifies the default security zone that is used for a particular protocol (ftp, http, https). To change the default setting, you can either add a protocol to a security zone by clicking Add Sites on the Security tab, or you can add a DWORD value under the Domains key. The name of the DWORD value must match the protocol name, and it must not contain any colons (:) or slashes (/). \\n\\nThe ProtocolDefaults key also contains DWORD values that specify the default security zones where a protocol is used. You cannot use the controls on the Security tab to change these values. This setting is used when a particular Web site does not fall in a security zone. \\n\\nThe Ranges key contains ranges of TCP/IP addresses. Each TCP/IP range that you specify appears in an arbitrarily named key. This key contains a string value (:Range) that contains the specified TCP/IP range.

Poor control causes many issues (and you know that!) and can even be life threatening.\\n\\nHow is it managed?  The first step is to try and figure out what causes your asthma.  This can often be an allergy (although asthma can also be triggered by other things such as cold air and exercise).  Regardless of the trigger, a doctor will work with you to reduce that trigger.  (In the case of allergies, this can involve everything from covering the mattress if the allergy is to dust to nasal sprays to allergy shots to limiting your exposure to certain things).\\n\\nThe doctor may also prescribe a slower acting medicine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.  This most often an inhaler but could also be a pill.  And this is important:  asthma seems to sort of feed on itself and treatment can help reduce the inflamation.  Also important is to understand that this will not stop an astma attack that you justt started having -- it takes days to have an impact.\\n\\nIn addition, a doctor may presecribe a fast acting inhaler (often called a rescue inhaler).  This is designed to be used to treat a current astma attack.\\n\\nSo the plan:  a) reduce the triggers that cause the asthma; b) longer term medication to help soothe the inflamation and reduce the severity/frequemcy; and c) a rescue inhaler when a and b fail.  If you find yourself using the rescue inhaler often, contact your doctor as the first two steps probably need refined.\\n\\nMake sense? Good luck!",

Some fields (counseling, for example) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level (60 semester hours) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed. Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate (i.e. Infant Mental Health Nursing) in which case the certificate is very useful. On the other hand, some fields really require a doctorate (most college teaching, for example) in which case the post-masters certificate, while good to have, won't fulfil the occupational requirement.\\n\\nI think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest, and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.\\n\\nHope this helps.",

Many cultures do not take them kindly. Darkened sunglasses of particular shapes may be in vogue as a fashion accessory. Note that normal glasses are very rarely worn without a practical purpose. Curiously, they can project an image of uncool nerdiness that sunglasses do not have. The impact on nonverbal communication and the cool image can be the reasons for wearing sunglasses by night or indoors. People also wear sunglasses when they don't want others to see that they're high by looking at their bloodshot eyes.\\nEyeglasses improve visual comfort. Various types of disposable sunglasses are dispensed to patients after receiving mydriatic eye drops during eye examinations\\nIt is important that the makers of one's sunglasses ensure that the glasses protect against UV (ultraviolet) rays.

Conversely, if the water levels are very high, the majority of the wave energy will be dissipated on the structure face or will overtop the structure. Therefore, the amount of downcutting is very sensitive to lake levels. The picture at right, taken in the County of Prince Edward, Ontario, visually demonstrates the downcutting process.

Thus the essence of sympathy is that a person's feelings reflect or are like those of another.\\n\\nSympathy exists when the feelings or emotions of one person give rise to similar feelings in another person, creating a state of shared feeling. In common usage, sympathy is usually the sharing of unhappiness or suffering, but it can also refer to sharing other (positive) emotions as well. In a broader sense, it can refer to the sharing of political or ideological sentiments, such as in the phrase \"a communist sympathiser\" .\\n\\nThe PSYCHOLOGICAL state of primitive sympathy is closely linked with that of empathy, but is not identical to it. Empathy refers to the ability to perceive and directly experientially feel another person's emotions as they feel them, but makes no statement as to how they are viewed. Sympathy, by contrast, implies a degree of equal feeling, that is, the sympathiser views the matter similarly to how the person themselves does. It thus implies concern, or care or a wish to alleviate negative feelings others are experiencing.\\n\\nThus it is possible to be:\\n\\n    * Empathetic but not sympathetic, by internally experiencing their feeling but not being motivated to alleviating action as a result (eg, a lust killer who is aroused by his victim's fear, or a con artist who knows how his \"mark\" feels but uses it to manipulate not support),\\n      and it is also possible to be:\\n    * Sympathetic but not empathetic by realising (perhaps cognitively) someone is upset and wanting to alleviate that, but not experiencing their sense of upset directly and internally as an emotional state within themselves (eg, a person at a help desk who sees another in distress, does not feel distress themselves, but tries to find what is wrong and help them anyway). \\nhttp://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/sympathy",

Doctors say it can be a sign of a serious medical condition.\\n\\nSurgery or the use of a bulky face mask was the only proven way to quiet nighttime noise. But now there's new hope thanks to a new treatment called the pillar procedure. \\n\\nHow the Pillar Procedure works\\nThe Pillar Procedure addresses one of the anatomical components of sleep apnea and snoring: the soft palate. During the Pillar Procedure, three tiny woven inserts are placed in the soft palate to help reduce the vibration that causes snoring and the ability of the soft palate to obstruct the airway. Once in place, the inserts add structural support to the soft palate. Over time, the body's natural tissue response to the inserts increases the structural integrity of the soft palate.\\nhttp://www.restoremedical.com/pillar.asp",

The program supports playback of OGG, MP2, MP3, MP4, DivX, DVD, and a whole slew of other file types. In addition, it also can function as a streaming media server. Because of its open-source foundation, VLC Media Player evolves quickly, with new features and fixes released frequently. Though the interface varies from platform to platform, the sparseness of the Windows version leaves plenty to be desired. \\n\\nThe best part is that it can even play parts of corrupted files, which other player cannot do. Even if you don't have codecs of a particular file format, it will play it.\\n\\nIts also very light on memory and the processor.\\n\\nThe only con of this player is that its interface is too plain, no sophistication, not that good a GUI. But if you are looking for some serious Mutimedia playing, this is right for the job.\\n\\nYou can download it from:\\nhttp://www.download.com/VLC-Media-Player/3003-2194_4-10410655.html?tag=tab_rev\\n\\nFor a good list of comparisons, check out :\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_media_players",

In modern-day Japan, the hachimaki is likely to be worn by proud employees at an office party, or by a new mother giving birth. It is popular  to customize Hachimakis with a phrase that best describes the reason for wearing it. Coworkers might present an employee with a Hachimaki gift to commemorate his or her promotion.\\nThough uncertain, the origin of the Hachimaki may be related to its being worn by religious practitioners of harsh self-denial who believed that this lifestyle, at death, would result in the relinquishing of the enthralled soul and lead to its ultimate unity with the divine.",

Earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating.\\n\\nThe term tsunami comes from the Japanese language meaning harbour (\"tsu\", 津) and wave (\"nami\", 波 or 浪). Although in Japanese tsunami is used for both the singular and plural, in English tsunamis is well-established as the plural. The term was created by fishermen who returned to port to find the area surrounding the harbour devastated, although they had not been aware of any wave in the open water. A tsunami is not a sub-surface event in the deep ocean; it simply has a much smaller amplitude (wave heights) offshore, and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometres long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a passing \"hump\" in the ocean.\\n\\nTsunamis have been historically referred to as tidal waves because as they approach land they take on the characteristics of a violent onrushing tide rather than the sort of cresting waves that are formed by wind action upon the ocean (with which people are more familiar). However, since they are not actually related to tides the term is considered misleading and its usage is discouraged by oceanographers.\\n\\nFor more information on a tsunami, visit:\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami",

However, it is important that tenants check their own rental agreements to determine what kind of notice must be given before they move out.\\n\\nLeases. If the tenant moves out at the expiration of a lease, in most cases it is not necessary to give the landlord a written notice. However, the lease should be consulted to be sure a formal notice is not required.\\n\\nIf a tenant stays beyond the expiration of the lease, and the landlord accepts the next month's rent, the tenant then is assumed to be renting under a month-to-month agreement.\\n\\nA tenant who leaves before a lease expires is responsible for paying the rent for the rest of the lease. However, the landlord must make an effort to re-rent the unit at a reasonable price. If this is not done, the tenant may not be liable for rent beyond a reasonable period of time.\\n\\nMonth-to-Month Rental Agreements. When a tenant wants to end a month-to-month rental agreement, written notice must be given to the landlord. The notice must be received at least 20 days before the end of the rental period (the day before rent is due). The day on which the notice is delivered does not count. A landlord cannot require a tenant to give more than 20 days notice when moving out.\\n\\nWhat if a tenant moves out without giving proper notice? The law says the tenant is liable for rent for the lesser of: 30 days from the day the next rent is due, or 30 days from the day the landlord learns the tenant has moved out. However, the landlord has a duty to try and find a new renter. If the dwelling is rented before the end of the 30 days, the former tenant must pay only until the new tenant begins paying rent.\\n\\nWhen a landlord wants a month-to-month renter to move out, a 20-day notice is required.",

Each with his own perception and understanding and most times with a very complicated explanation.\\n\\n   It was not until I took up hiking in the mountains of Tennessee that I had plenty of time to ponder the complexities of this age old question.  Being a Christian I was raised to believe certain things and to look at life in certain ways.  But as I got older and began studying and searching for myself I began to realize that what I was taught as a child was not as complicated as some would have had me believe.\\n\\n   I always wondered why God would have put us here simply to suffer through this life.  After all he does love us and of that I have no doubt.  So why then?  I studied and pondered and reflected in deep thought just like many have before me, and like them, to no avail.\\n\\n  Then one day while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee I came to a clearing overlooking a valley.  It was a clear day with the sun shining bright.  As I looked out across the valley I saw an eagle soaring on the wind.  And as usual the thought crossed my mind that it would be really nice to be able to soar like that.  Then I thought, do eagles look at us and wish they were like us?\\n\\n   That is when something inside me clicked.  It was more like an explosion or an awakening of sorts.  The meaning of life was so simple that I had looked right past it thinking that it would be some big discovery of some sort.  Some words of wisdom that would make me look like a genius.  Instead three words kept going through my brain.  Thundering as if God himself was speaking them directly into my thoughts.\\n\\n   We spend our entire lives from the moment we take our first breath til our last one is used up trying to be something we aren't.  Whether we are trying to get a job by seeming more experienced or trying to win someones heart by becoming the person they are looking for.  We act differently in different situations.  Why? \\n\\n    It is in our nature I suppose or at least the nature of the flesh.  But God's nature is to be the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.  And since we are to strive to be more \"God-like\", which I used to think meant to try to be perfect, then the meaning of life is nothing more than to \"JUST BE YOU!\"\\n\\n   Yep, it is just that simple.  Be you no matter what happens or where you are or who you are with or what you are trying to achieve.  If you can do this you will be something that the majority of people will never be.

The two biggest are the Sunnis and the Shi'ites, with the Sunnis being the largest of all and representing the vast majority of Muslims. Shi'ites are a minority everywhere except Iran. \\n\\nAfter them, the two most influential sects are the Sufis and the Wahhabis. The Sufis represent a mystical tradition in Islam, whereas the Wahhabis are a strict traditionalist tradition which is dominant on the Arabian peninsula, but has little support elsewhere. \\n\\nUnlike churches, mosques are not denominational. Despite the differences among Muslims, traditional Friday prayer services are largely similar and Muslims of any background are welcome to attend services at any mosque. \\n\\nWho are the Sunnis?\\nSunnis are Muslims who are considered the more \"orthodox\" believers. Sunnis follow all of the most traditional beliefs and actions. \\n\\nWho are the Shi'ites?\\nThe term Shi'a is a shortened form of Shi'at Ali, which means \"the party of Ali\" - and at the time of Ali's death in 661, that is probably all it was: a party or tendency of people who supported Ali's claims to the caliphate. Over time, they became the largest non-Sunni sect in Islam. \\n\\nWho are the Sufis?\\nSufism is important to the development of Islam because it is in this tradition that the more spiritual and mystical aspects were preserved. This stands in contrast to the mainstream of Islam which, through its first centuries, was more concerned with the expansion and organization of the general community. \\n\\nWho are the Kahrijites?\\nIn Arabic, their label means \"to go out\" - they were, in effect, the first Mulism dissidents and rebels, being present almost from the dawn of Islam. Like later dissidents, they chose to separate themselves from the main body of believers, feeling that the majority of Muslims had lost the \"true path.\" \\n\\nWho are the Wahhabis?\\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab could be considered the first modern Islamic fundamentalist. He made the central point of his reform movement the idea that absolutely every idea added to Islam after the third century of the Mulsim era was false and should be eliminated. \\n\\nWho are the Ismailis?\\nAn early Shi'a sect which split from the main group because of a dispute over who should be considered the next Imam. \\n\\nWho are the Zaidis?\\nFormed by Zaid, a grandson of Husain, the Zaidis have believed that the true Imam must publicly assert his claim to the title and seek to overthrow the corrupt regime run by unacceptable rulers. \\n\\nWho are the Fatimids?\\nThe Fatimids are a successor movement to the Isma'ilis and are descendants of Fatima and Ali through the line of Isma'il. In the tenth century, those descendants asserted themselves as caliphs in North Africa, and ruled Egypt from 969 to 1171. \\n\\nWho are the Nizari?\\nThis sect is actually very well known around the world, but under a different name: the Assassins. \\n\\nWho are the Alawis?\\nAlso known as Nusayris, the Alawis are a branch of Isma'ilism which has gone so far along its own path that many Muslims no longer even regard it as a form of Islam. The term Alawis actually just means \"followers of Ali,\" which is used in some countries to refer to all Shi'a in general. Some think that they worship Ali as God, but that isn't entirely accurate. \\n\\nWho are the Druze?\\nThe Druze comprise another sect which is not widely regarded as being \"truly\" Muslim. This group diverged from mainstream Islam in the eleventh century when some Isma'ilis started to believe that God became manifest in the personality of a prophet or imam. \\n\\nWho are the Baha'i?\\nBaha'i is another movement which is descended from Islam, but which most Muslims today no longer regard as authentically Islamic. \\n\\nMost of these are Arab Muslims..

These verses refer to prophets, but it applies to spirits, also. Test them to see if they seem to be from God, and pray that God will reveal to you whether it is from Him or not. He will provide you with answers!\\nIn Acts 16:16-19, we see that spirits can come from the      , but they may seem to be from God (the message may seem to be true and good). This is another case where you just have to pray and then trust that God will show you whether it is Him speaking to you or not. \\nAll in all, it just involves a lot of prayer. Pray that God will reveal to you whether it is His voice or not. He will show you. Sometimes you'll just get a feeling that will tell you it is Him, and sometimes there will be signs everywhere you turn that tell you what the right thing is to do. \\nCheck out Isaiah 30:21.

            "input": "Long answer short : Follow three steps :\\n\\n(1) Put good content on your site\\n(2) Register it to search engines\\n(3) Convince other sites to link more.\\n\\nExplaination :\\n\\nI could have gone on lenght on answering your query.  At the first part, one need's to understand the meaning of page rank. You can study a detailed article on it at http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html\\n\\nIn short, here's an example. There's an election and several candidates have stood up. Its natural that the guy with the most votes wins. Analogously, whenever a external page links to your website, it casts a vote for your website. So, when you search for a relevant keyword for your pages, the results come as per the no of links that you have collected.\\n\\nTo get more links, you can ask some of your friends who have website to put link to your website. The more the links, the higher is your rank in google results. An alternative is to start your own blog on 3-4 websites, and in each blog, put a link to your website. Indeed, if your site has quality content, mpressed visitors start linking you, specially the blogging community.\\n\\nAnother important part is that who links you. For example, if you get a link from a website which already has a high page rank, you automatically get a better rank. For example, if you get a link from microsoft.com or cnet.com, which have a highest page ranks, your rank shoots up automatically.\\n\\nGoogle rank is composed of many other factors, but the only factor it misses out is the popularity by visitors who go to the links directly. Yahoo does a good job by keeping that into account. If you carefully see the link that are seen in the Yahoo search results, a similar vote is also casted by clicking on the link in the search results. It could be possible that your website has huge no. of visitors who come through searches, but small number of links. Then its Yahoo rank would be high (more accurate), but google rank would be low. There have been many such interesting cases, so don't just consider google as your only target. Why google does not keep this 'click popularity' feature is because it takes a certain delay of time( for registering of vote on Yahoo and forwarding to the actual link), which Google does not want to take.\\n\\nThings You Should Never Do In Life:\\nNever try to promote your site commercially from spamsters. Some of their sites are banned from google database. And if they give a link to your website, your page rank drops down drastically, and even might get removed from the search results. Also, do not link to their websites.\\n\\nThis is the solution to crux of your problem. You can read further on such search engine optimizations at the following sites :\\nhttp://wolfram.org/writing/howto/3.html\\nhttp://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterGoogleRankings.aspx\\nhttp://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/promo_no16.htm\\nhttp://us.ecademy.com/node.php?id=58077\\nhttp://www.paramountwebmasters.com/improve_my_rankings_on_google.php\\nhttp://www.graphic-design.com/Web/increase_rank.html",

The appellation of \"Doctor\" (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, to knowledge, and to the spread of knowledge.\\n\\nThe degree was popularized in the 19th century at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. From here it spread to the U.S., arriving at Yale University in 1861, and then to the UK in 1921. This displaced the existing Doctor of Philosophy degree in some Universities; for instance, the D.Phil. (higher doctorate in the faculty of philosophy) at the University of St Andrews was discontinued and replaced with the Ph.D. (research doctorate). However, some UK universities such as Oxford, York and Sussex retain the D.Phil. appellation for their research degrees, as does the University of Waikato in New Zealand.\\n\\nSome ability to carry out original research must be documented by producing a dissertation or thesis of book length. The degree is often a prerequisite for permanent employment as a university lecturer or as a researcher in some sciences, though this varies on a regional basis. In others such as engineering or geology, a doctoral degree is considered desirable but not essential for employment. In a small but growing number of fields, the doctorate is felt to injure employment prospects by causing 'overqualification' for the job.\\n\\nIn layman's terms, it's someone who has spent a large amount of time doing research in a particular field, usually on a very specific subject, and been able to demonstrate that they have an advanced understanding of that subject -- particularly their specific research area.",

The amount of 'space junk' has doubled since 1990 and now poses 'a navigational hazard,' says Norwegian space specialist Erik Tandberg.

The 'rapid accumulation of debris' could 'complicate the further development of astronautics since there would be a direct threat of collision with debris fragments which travel at very high altitudes,' says Dr. Yablokov.\\n\\nAmong the junk now overhead are 37 nuclear-powered satellites put in space by the US and former Soviet Union.

Therefore, you cannot apply Marx's theory 'directly' to a country today. The capitalist system has developed internal restraints and \"decompressing\" mechanisms that ensure that, even when the inequality and the poverty or the income distribution are ignominious, the system is not under danger of disruption.\\n\\nCapitalism, as Marx said, might have the seed of self destruction, but it also has selfpreservation mechanisms (corporations, NGOs, formal democracy --even in non-democratic countries--). Also, it offers what some people might call a 'messianic' or 'religious' promise: the best of the worlds is here, on earth and while you are alive, and you need money and success to attain it (I am talking about the protestant capitalism, not the catholic one, which came later): therefore, the success of capitalism is guaranteed by the fact that the lower classes want to become middle class, and middle class wants to become high class. This ensures all of them, especially the middle class, is ultra-conservative, fighting to keep the status-quo, so they can (someday) be high-class and enjoy what the system promises (of course, the status-quo needs to be based on inequality, so you have classes and people fight to escalate in the social chain).\\n\\nwhat do I know?...",

The band was formed in 1990 and proved to be highly successful, with 8 UK Number 1 singles to their credit. \\n\\nOut of all the members of Take That, Robbie Williams never really seemed to fit in. Roguishly handsome where his bandmates were merely cute, Williams was tougher and sexier than the rest, which made him more distinctive. He also fought regularly with the other members and their management, primarily because he was occasionally adverse to being so heavily packaged. So it didn't come as a surprise that he was the first to leave the band, departing early in the summer of 1995 to pursue a solo career; by some accounts, he was fired from the group. Although he was the first out of the gate, it took Williams awhile to get started.\\n\\n Williams released his first solo album, Life Thru a Lens, in 1997. The album became a big hit in Britain, prompting his second, I've Been Expecting You, in 1998. The Ego Has Landed, a U.S.-only compilation designed for breaking Williams to American audiences, was released stateside in the spring of 1999. Sing When You're Winning followed in late 2000, gaining success with the video hit \"Rock DJ,\" while a big-band album of standards (Swing When You're Winning) appeared a year later. During 2002, Williams celebrated an enormous new contract with EMI (rumored to be upward of 80 million dollars), but suffered the loss of his longtime production partner, Guy Chambers. Escapology, the fifth Robbie Williams album (and the last including Chambers' input), sold millions of copies in Europe, though it failed to persuade American audiences. As a result, the 2003 concert record Live at Knebworth wasn't released in the States.\\n\\nIn 2002, the UK public voted Williams to be on the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons (at number 77). He was also voted 17th in Channel 4's 100 Worst Britons poll.\\n\\n\\nFor more information on him, please refer to the following links :\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams\\nhttp://www.google.com/musica?aid=KIL_YZIrTEP&oi=musicr\\n\\nList of all 182 songs and lyrics :\\nhttp://robbie-williams.lyrics-songs.com/ \\n\\nTo Watch his videos:\\nhttp://www.mtv.com/music/artist/williams_robbie/artist.jhtml",

Some poles are pinky-short and some tetherball-tall. Erected on a lawn, balanced in a coffee can near a photocopier, stuck in a pail of rocks in the living room or suspended from fishing line on the front porch. the pole symbolizes nothing.\\n\\nThe Airing of Grievances\\n\\nLike everything else Festivus, the AOG has evolved some wild variations, but the core of it remains lashing into others and the world about how they have been disappointments. This usually brings participants into a circle of sorts in which each takes turns excoriating friends, enemies, relatives, acquaintances and strangers. When all who care to have taken a turn griping, there is no required hugging or making up.\\n\\nFeats of Strength\\n\\nThe FOS generally follows the AOG. Under the Seinfeld orthodoxy, Festivus is not over until the head of the household is wrestled to the floor and pinned. While there is an undeniable classic elegance to this, real world Festivus practitioners have developed other cathartic methods of discharging pent-up energy against one's fellows, including thumb wrestling and washer tossing.",

In relativity theory intervals of time are defined as a kind of generalised distance between two points in a 4-dimensional geometry.  This 4-dimensional geometry (aka space-time) is defined using real numbers, resulting in distances always being real numbers, and so there ends up being no smallest distance.\\n\\nQuantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics have the same continuum underlying space and time, but the complication is that whilst time is continuous it is not possible to _measure_ time scales less than a certain amount.  But still, the equations of the theory are still written in terms of differentIAL (c.f. difference) equations and are thus fundamentally continuous.\\n\\nThe impossibility of measuring suficiently small time scales has led _some_ theorists to consider the possibility that spacetime is actually a lattice of discrete points, thus making space and time fundamentally quantised.  It has the advantage that if you make the additional assumption that the overall size of the universe is finite then integrals over the whole of space (which might not converge) end up being just finite sums, which always converge.  Still, the theory has a long way to go simply to catch up with present-day theories, and is certainly not mainstream theoretical physics.",

Asteroid collision\\n\\nBasically a huge rock hit our planet causing a plum of sediment to float into our atmosphere reducing light from the sun.  This reduction killed off a huge portion of the existing plant life, thus wiping out the food supply for many animals.  As one thing leads to another, massive extinctions followed.\\n\\n2. The Oort cloud\\n\\nSimilar to the asteroid theory, an Oort cloud is a literal storm of comets.  The results follow pretty closely with the single asteroid theory.\\n\\n3. Environment changes\\n\\nThis is a little more vague, but also a little simpler to prove to a degree (pun intended).  The theory follows the notion of the magnetic poles flipping (causing tremendous weather changes), or some other massive event (such as the melting of the caps, or an ice age) that would in turn kill off most of the larger species on the planet.\\n\\nFor further information, please read the wikipedia article.",

Target the right demographic. What people purchase your products or services? Make sure you reach those people and not someone else. For example, advertising to business professionals during daytime soap operas while professionals are at the office probably won't be effective.\\n\\n2. Make sure your viewers (listeners, etc.) get enough repetitions to remember your ads. If someone sees your TV ad just once, odds are they won't even remember it. It takes a few viewings before people start remembering your ads. Try to make sure that when you purchase an air plan, your average viewer will receive at least 3 impressions (more are better), otherwise, you will likely be throwing your money away.\\n\\nAmongst various advertising media, outdoor (billboards) and radio traditionally have a lower cost per impression than TV, so they may be better deals for you.\\n\\nIf you do think you might be interested in TV advertising, talk to sales reps from your local TV stations and cable system(s). They should be able to develop air plans for you that target the demographics you are looking for.\\n\\nTV sales reps can also generally suggest commercial production companies that do affordable work. And they may even have special programs for new advertisers to make producing your first ad more affordable.\\n\\nIf you talk to several sales reps, you should be able to get a good deal simply by comparing prices. Just make sure that you're comparing apples to apples. You should be comparing the CPM (cost per thousand impressions) not the overall cost of running ads, or the number of ads being run. And you should make sure that the CPMs you compare are for the same demographic, for example, women 18-34, or people 25-49, income above $50,000.\\n\\nWhatever you decide your target demographic is, make sure all your CPM estimates from sales reps reflect those demographics and not some other numbers that the station thinks is more favorable to them. Some demographics are much cheaper to reach than others, and you will not be comparing equivalent pricing if you don't look at an identical demo.\\n\\nHope this helps. :-)",

As this theory goes, our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed. Therefore, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood. \\n\\nYawning, then, would be an involuntary reflex (something we can't really control) to help us control our oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Sounds good, but other studies have shown that breathing more oxygen does not decrease yawning. Likewise, breathing more carbon dioxide does not increase yawning. Hmmm. Now what?\\n\\nAnother theory is that yawning stretches the lungs and lung tissue. Stretching and yawning may be a way to flex muscles and joints, increase heart rate, and feel more awake. \\n\\nOther people believe that yawning is a protective reflex to redistribute the oil-like substance called surfactant (say: sur-fak-tunt) that helps keep lungs lubricated inside and keeps them from collapsing. So, if we didn't yawn, according to this theory, taking a deep breath would become harder and harder - and that would not be good!\\n\\nBut there is one idea about yawning that everyone knows to be true. It seems contagious. If you yawn in class, you'll probably notice a few other people will start yawning, too. Even thinking about yawning can get you yawning.

Disadvantage with the simple method shown above is that it does not always compensate for the noise produced in the image. This is were Wiener filter provides better results.

This error becomes\\n\\ne^2 = E[(I - est_I)^2]\\n\\nwhere E[] is the expected value of the argument.\\n\\nIf you search for practical implementation of wiener filter then I am sure you will find answer to how to actually implement it.\\n\\nI hope this was the answer you were looking for.",

The faster you go, the slower time goes for you. This effect is negligable unless you are going very close to the speed of light.) if v(velocity) were equal to c(the speed of light) you would have a zero in the denomonator.\\nthe formula is:\\nt'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)\\n\\nwhere t' is the time that has passed from a stationary observer, t is the time that has passed for you, sqrt means square root and ^2 means squared. As you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as 1.0000000000001 or something, and so time is not really affected. As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time actuall slows down for the object moving at such velocities. This formula is correct, it is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and I have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas. \\n\\nAlong with time, length contracts and mass expands by the same factor.  If you were to go close to the speed of light, your mass would increase and length would decrease. This means that the density of your body would increase more and more as you went faster and faster, and your blood eventually wouldn't be able to flow anymore and your cells would die of oxygen starvation.  Not that it really matters, because to even begin witnessing this effect, you would have to be going at least 90 or 95% or so the speed of light.  \\n\\nNow to answer your question in that is it actually physically possible to get close... considering they have particle accelerators stories high and miles long requiring tremendous amounts of energy in order to even get tiny protons and neutrons to move at such speeds, it doesn't seem like they're anywhere near accelerating something big anytime soon.  F=ma, meaning in order to get something that weighs one gram, like a paperclip to accelerate to the same degree as they do the protons, you would need about 2x10^24 times the force.  That notation just means a 2 with 24 zeros after it.  The reason for this is that that is how much more mass a paperclip has then a proton.

Chilean historicians say that the war started for other reasons, but peruvian an bolivean say that the reason was the saltpeter.\\n\\nPeru and Bolivia had a treaty: In case of being attacked any of those, the other would militarly help the other country. It was a terrible war. Bolivia was defeated and abandoned the war and lost all it's coast (that's why Bolivia does not have a sea). But the war still went on and Peru stood alone fighting. Peru was inferior militarly speaking and lost the war and land too. Chilean soldiers conquered Lima and started to destroy the cities they conquered. It was painful for peruvian people, for both losing land and having the cities raped.",

As CSS was fast becoming the most popular topic in the web design area over at Sitepoint's forum (were I was a moderator at the time), we decided to run our own 'garden-like' competition. I was involved in the contest's organisation, and developed two example designs: the default Sitepoint style, and the slightly more elaborate 'Gothic'. \\n\\nImagine my surprise when, out of the blue, Dave Shea emailed me to ask if I'd like to rework 'Gothic' as an entry to the Zen Garden. It was this initial vote of confidence that pretty much took the 'fear' of the Garden from me and spurred me on to explore a variety of new techniques and styles, pushing my knowledge of CSS further than the constraints and boundaries of my large Salford redesign would have allowed. \\n\\nCertainly working on 'door to my garden' (which seems to be my most successful entry, even managing an appearance in Dave and Molly's book 'The Zen of CSS Design' - see the sample chapter at creativepro.com) has provided me with a very strong grounding on the various issues involving the use of background images and cross browser alternatives, and probably represents my most 'finished' piece of work in terms of striking a good balance between visual design and clean, simple stylesheet usage. \\n\\nFor completeness' sake, it may also be worth mentioning that I have two more entries which unfortunately did not quite make it into the 'official' list: phonephreak in the 'conceptual designs' category, an admittedly unreadable design that mimics a double page spread magazine layout, and an advanced version of 'door to my garden' under 'special effects', which uses some :hover trickery in browsers that support it, yet degrades gracefully in those that don't.",

Paper also doesn't require an external power supply. Yet it does have some limitations: Once you've printed words on paper, those words cannot be changed without at least leaving some marks, and it is also difficult to carry around a large number of books.\\n\\nTwo companies are simultaneously developing similar electronic inks -- E Ink of Cambridge, MA, and Xerox in Palo Alto, CA. At first glance, a bottle of electronic ink looks just like regular ink, but a closer examination shows something much different. Although the two companies' products vary slightly, here are the three components of both electronic inks that give them the ability to rearrange upon command:\\n\\n    * Millions of tiny microcapsules or cavities\\n    * An ink or oily substance filling the microcapsules or cavities\\n    * Pigmented chips or balls with a negative charge floating inside the microcapsule \\n\\nElectronic ink can be applied to the same materials that regular ink can be printed on. In the case of a digital book, the pages would be made out of some kind of ultra-thin plastic. The ink would cover the entire page, separated by cells that resemble the cells on graph paper. Think of these cells as pixels on your computer screen, with each cell wired to microelectronics embedded in this plastic sheet. These microelectronics would then be used to apply a positive or negative charge to the microcapsules to create the desired text or images.",

The atomic weight is the number of protons plus the average number of neutrons found in magnesium nuclei in nature (with a small correction mostly due to the fact that the binding energy of the nucleus is included in its mass via E=mc^2). Most naturally occurring Magnesium atoms (about 80% of them) have 12 neutrons, while 10% have 13 neutrons and 10% have 14 neutrons. The different numbers of neutrons indicate the different isotopes of Magnesium. The chemical properties of Magnesium depend (nearly) entirely on the electrons, and therefore depend on how many protons there are, and not how many neutrons; add extra neutrons and it's still \"Magnesium\", but it may weigh more. A handbook of chemistry and physics lists all isotopes with between 8 and 16 neutrons. All except the three naturally occurring isotopes are radioactive and decay to other nuclei. \\nhttp://van.hep.uiuc.edu/van/qa/section/Everything_Else/The_Elements/20021026080623.htm \\nThese links will help you understand the concepts more nicely.\\nhttp://www.crocodile-clips.com/absorb/AC4/sample/LR303.html\\nhttp://van.hep.uiuc.edu/van/qa/section/New_and_Exciting_Physics/Inside_the_Atom/982893827.htm",

In May Bush requested a transfer to an Alabama Air National Guard unit with no planes and minimal duties. Bush's immediate superiors approved the transfer, but higher-ups said no. The matter was delayed for months. In August Bush missed his annual flight physical and was grounded. (Some have speculated that he was worried about failing a drug test--the Pentagon had instituted random screening in April.) In September he was ordered to report to a different unit of the Alabama guard, the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in Montgomery. Bush says he did so, but his nominal superiors say they never saw the guy, there's no documentation he ever showed up, and not one of the six or seven hundred soldiers then in the unit has stepped forward to corroborate Bush's story.\\n\\nAfter the November election Bush returned to Texas, but apparently didn't notify his old Texas guard unit for quite a while, if ever. The Boston Globe initially reported that he started putting in some serious duty time in May, June, and July of 1973 to make up for what he'd missed. But according to a piece in the New Republic, there's no evidence Bush did even that. Whatever the case, even though his superiors knew he'd blown off his duties, they never disciplined him. (No one's ever been shot at dawn for missing a weekend guard drill, but policy at the time was to put shirkers on active duty.) Indeed, when Bush decided to go to business school at Harvard in the fall of 1973, he requested and got an honorable discharge--eight months before his service was scheduled to end.\\n\\nBush's enemies say all this proves he was a cowardly deserter.

If you did enough to make her leave you, it must have been pretty bad.

In both cases, I don't know if there is anything you could do. If she left because of pure emotional reaction, you might have a chance, but if it was an intellectual decision, it is not likely to work. Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with, but logic is usually rock solid.  You could offer therapy for you both, however if you are already 'divorced', it seems a little too final to try that. Apologies alone won't really get you anywhere. Not much of an answer, but without any details, it's the best I've got. My main advice though is to know when to give up. Some battles can't be won.

However, the general rule still applies:  snow fall equels an increase in temprature untill a stabilization point has been reached.\\n\\nSnow that falls within the normal range is usualy wet snow, ie it is snow that is mixed with a bit of melted snow (water vapor), thus causing it to be heavy snow.\\n\\nSnow that falls below the temprature range tends to be dry snow, ie, snow that has completely frozen over.\\n\\nDry snow can be a major problem as it doesn't allow for the stabilization to occure at a quick rate, instead, blizzards, huge snow storms, ect, can take effect before the storm system actually stabilizes.\\n\\nHope that made sens&#92;e",

He will often monitor calls himself or even take calls. \\n\\nMost large companies, espically those that outsource, have a difficult time controlling ALL of their employees and making sure they are representing the company as a concerned and understanding individual. To handle the flow of calls, so you are not waiting hours to speak to someone, requires a great deal of man-power; the more people you have between the top and the front line, the more difficult it is to ensure everyone is upholding your principles. How far did you go with your experience? Maybe you should try writing to Michael Dell to let him know your concerns. \\n\\nI find, at least as far as technical support, that some customers have expectations that are unrealistic. Many people think that because you bought -insert the name of any software product made by another company here- with their computer, that Dell should provide support for it. Think about it, if you buy Norton Antivirus from BestBuy, do you complain to them about Norton not working and expect them to fix it? Not likely. you contact the manufacture who is specialised in it. Many people have problems with their systems due to spyware and adware programs, but dont know they need to install anti-spyware software and do not recognise the symptoms. My question is, where you looking for free assistance with a DELL MANUFACTURED PRODUCT? \\n\\nI am not speaking on behalf of Dell here, but meerly my own experiences and how I look at our service. I would, at least, suggest contacting Michael Dell prior to giving up on Dell completely. I know that we DO hear feed back from him regarding both positive and negative customer experiences.\\n\\nPS: I have worked for other major comuter manufacturers and I must say Dell is NOT the worst in the industry, by far.

Comprehensive knowledge of all systems of the body and diagnostic procedures enable the DC to thoroughly evaluate a patient, address disorders relating to the spine and determine the need for referral to another health care provider.\\n\\nDoctors of Chiropractic are primary health care providers.\\nAccording to the Center for Studies in Health Policy, \"The DC can provide all three levels of primary care interventions and therefore is a primary care provider, as are MDs and DOs. The doctor of chiropractic is a gatekeeper to the health care system and an independent practitioner who provides primary care services. The DC's office is a direct access portal of entry to the full scope of service.\"\\n\\nDoctors of Chiropractic are licensed in all 50 states.\\nDCs have been licensed and recognized for many decades in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nChiropractic is recognized by governmental health care programs.\\nChiropractic is included in Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Care Benefits Programs, Federal Workers' Compensation and all state workers' compensation programs. Chiropractic students are qualified to receive federal student loan assistance and DCs are authorized to be commissioned as health care officers in the U.S. Armed Forces.\\n\\nThe practice of chiropractic is based on sound scientific principles.\\nThe existence of the nervous system as the primary control mechanism of the body is an undisputed scientific fact. Its relationship with the spine is the focus of the practice of chiropractic. The spine develops in utero to provide two primary functions: (1) allow for freedom of movement and (2) house and protect the spinal cord. When the vertebrae of the spine become misaligned through trauma or repetitive injury, two major consequences will result: (1) the range of motion becomes limited and (2) spinal nerves emerging from the spinal cord are compromised. DCs use the term \"subluxation\" to describe such disruptions. Interruption of nerve flow can eventually lead to pain, disability, and an overall decrease in the quality of life. Conversely, the removal of that interference has been shown to have significant, lasting health benefits. Through the adjustment of the subluxation, the doctor of chiropractic endeavors to restore normal nerve expression. The body is then able to respond appropriately to any imbalance in the system, thus relieving symptoms and restoring health.\\n\\nDoctors of chiropractic provide effective, low-cost health care for a wide range of conditions.\\nStudies conducted according to the highest scientific standards and published by organizations not affiliated in any way with chiropractic institutions or associations continue to show the clinical appropriateness and effectiveness of chiropractic care. One of the most recent, funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health, stated emphatically that:\\n\\n\"On the evidence, particularly the most scientifically valid clinical studies, spinal manipulation applied by chiropractors is shown to be more effective than alternative treatments for low back pain...There would be highly significant cost savings if more management of low back pain was transferred from physician to chiropractors.\"\\n\\nThe doctor of chiropractic is an effective source of preventative and wellness care.\\nThe anatomical focus of the DC on the human spine has created the perception of the DC as just a \"back doctor.\" Although this perception is not entirely incorrect, it is very much incomplete. Doctors of chiropractic are a highly appropriate resource in matters of work-place safety, st",

But I venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.\\n\\nAccording to a report by researchers Norman Hearst and Stephen Hulley in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with AIDS after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million. With a condom it's even safer--one in 50 million. Just to put this in perspective, the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million (source: The Odds on Virtually Everything, Heron House, 1980). You're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning (1 in 600,000), having your house bombed (1 in 290,000), or being murdered (1 in 11,000).\\n\\nThe numbers get a lot worse if you engage in \"high-risk behavior\"--having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group, e.g., a gay or bisexual male or IV drug user from a major metro area, or a hemophiliac. The chances of getting AIDS from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected. Even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high--1 in 50,000 without a condom. That's because there's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative. (A few people go as long as 180 days.)\\n\\nFrom there on out, statistically speaking, things deteriorate pretty fast. If your partner is HIV-positive, your chances of getting AIDS after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom, 1 in 500 without. Have sex with an HIV-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11. Skip the gift wrap and they're 2 in 3.\\n\\nA couple points: These odds apply equally to men and women. Although there's reason to believe male-to-female AIDS transmission happens more often than female-to-male, the amount of difference is unknown. Also, I have to emphasize again, the numbers involve a lot of guesswork. The authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction. Still, one message comes through loud and clear: by far the best thing you can do to avoid AIDS is to be picky about your partners. Use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10, sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50, but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000. (You'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior, such as unprotected receptive anal sex.) Asking for a resume may not be romantic, but it beats Kaposi's sarcoma.",

There is such a homeless problem in California and not enough shelters to help all of the homeless. There are a few different people/groups of people I have witnessed that have made it their business to make hundreds of sandwiches a day and pass them out to the homeless. There was a lady in Los Angeles who would cook great healthy homemade soups and drive around to the different spots where she knew the homeless people would gather and she made sure they had something good to eat as regularly as possible. But sometimes people can't do that on such a grand scale and it still makes a big difference on a smaller scale sometimes. Just giving something to a homeless person - a warmed plate of your leftovers from dinner perhaps - is a great thing.\\n\\nWalk up to a homeless woman who is minding her own business, not begging off of anybody, and give her 10% of your weekly income. I met a man one time who did that because he no longer attended church and it was his form of paying tithes. See how big that woman's smile gets. Depending on what you make, you might be able to divide that among 10 homeless women and still get great, surprised, thankful, almost wondrous expressions of happiness.\\n\\nVolunteer to mentor or assist a homeless person who is not totally beyond help. There are plenty of homeless people out there who look beyond help. Homelessness is a battle of hopelessness. The longer a time a person remains homeless, the more hopeless they feel about everything. People who have been homeless for more than a year become \"The Chronic Homeless\" and their chances for being able to escape the confines of homelessnes are statistically decreased. Sometimes people just need an address for employment opportunities, a contact phone number for messages, encouragement, food, a safe place to store clothing and personal belongings. When homeless people don't have at least these meager advantages, it can be intensely difficult to make it back into a more normal type of living environment.\\n\\nBecome a mentor or a Big Brother.\\n\\nVolunteer to tutor children or speak to children to motivate them to study well so they can become a graphic designer or whatever they want to achieve.\\n\\nDonate some of your graphic design services or discount as a donation to help non-profit charities advertise events that can help them achieve their goals.\\n\\nCounty hospitals often welcome volunteer administrative help.\\n\\n(Just a few ideas - I could go on forever with this.

W. 2d 111, 112, reversed and remanded.\\n\\nSUMMARY: A Texas justice of the peace issued a warrant to search for narcotics in defendant's home; the warrant was based on an affidavit filed by two municipal police officers and reciting that affiants received reliable information from a credible person, and that affiants believed, that narcotics were being kept at defendant's premises for illegal sale and use. Over defendant's objection, heroin seized under the warrant was introduced in evidence at his trial in a Texas state court. Defendant was convicted of illegal possession of heroin, and his conviction was affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. (172 Tex Crim 629, 362 SW2d 111, affirmance upheld on rehearing, 172 Tex Crim 631, 362 SW2d 112.)\\n\\nOn certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed. In an opinion by Goldberg, J., expressing the views of six members of the Court, it was held that under the Fourteenth Amendment the heroin was not admissible in evidence because the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause, the standard for obtaining a search warrant being the same under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\\n\\nHarlan, J., concurred in the Court's opinion, stating that but for Ker v California, 374 US 23, 10 L ed 2d 726, 83 S Ct 1623, in which case he dissented, he would have affirmed the judgment of the Texas court.\\n\\nClark, J., joined by Black and Stewart, JJ., dissented, expressing the view that the majority substituted a rigid, academic formula for the unrigid standards of reasonableness and probable cause laid down by the Fourth Amendment.\\n\\nLAWYERS' EDITION HEADNOTES: \\n \\n [***HN1] \\nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §27\\nwarrants -- showing of probable cause -- judicial review --\\n \\nHeadnote: [1]\\nIn passing on the validity of a search warrant, the reviewing court may consider only information brought to the magistrate's attention; hence, the fact that the police may have kept a suspect's house under surveillance is irrelevant where, in applying for the warrant, the police did not mention any surveillance.\\n \\n [***HN2] \\nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §5\\nrestrictions on states -- warrant -- standards --\\n \\nHeadnote: [2]\\nThe standard for obtaining a search warrant is the same under the Fourth and under the Fourteenth Amendment, through which the Fourth Amendment's proscriptions of unreasonable searches and seizures are enforced against the states.\\n \\n [***HN3] \\nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §26\\nconstitutionality of search warrant --\\n \\nHeadnote: [3]\\nIn evaluating the constitutionality of a search warrant, the rule is that the informed and deliberate determinations of magistrates empowered to issue warrants are to be preferred over the hurried action of police officers who may happen to make arrests.\\n \\n [***HN4] \\nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §25\\nwithout warrant -- justification --\\n \\nHeadnote: [4]\\nThat facts known to police officers would constitute sufficient evidence to justify the issuance of a search warrant will not justify the officers in making a search without a warrant.\\n \\n [***HN5] \\nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §27\\nshowing probable cause -- judicial review --\\n \\nHeadnote: [5]\\nWhere a search is based upon a magistrate's, rather than a police officer's, determination of probable cause, the reviewing court will accept evidence of a less judicially competent or persuasive character than would have justified an officer in acting on his own without a warrant, and will sustain the judicial determination of probable cause so long as there was substa",

The reason for this is that people like to read, they like to learn.  And the more they read, and the more they come in to buy/return books, the more face you recieve per day.\\n\\nWe started a library program for our store, and did wonderfully!\\n\\nCheck out places such as azuregreen.com and look at their wholesell program, they are great.\\n\\nCheck out stores and suppliers in canada, as well, as they provide great products for cheap.\\n\\nConsider hosting local merchants, ect, within your shop.\\n\\nMain steps:  Get your state business licence from your secretary of state.  Get your city license if needed.  \\n\\nFind a good location, open your store.  Get some form of security.  Make sure you don't need a security permit from your local police department to operate a security system.\\n\\nGet some form of security camera system in y our store, this helps cut down on losses due to theft.  Trust me it will happen.\\n\\nFind an open minded land lord.  Don't go with one who is 'unsure' but go with one who likes the idea of a pagan store in the area.\\n\\nDO NOT CALL YOURSELF A WITCHCRAFT STORE.  Absoutly not, you are a Pagan Resource Center, or a Pagan Store.  The reason for this is that 'witchcraft' no matter what spin you put on it, will have a negative connotation to those around you in your community.  However if you are a Pagan store, or Pagan Resource Center, you have much more credibility.\\n\\nJoin local stores in intitiaves, and such to get your name out there.  Help with local planning of events for your community.\\n\\nLastly, advertise as best you can.\\n\\nIf you need more help, please email me, i'd be more than willing to help you setup :)",

They were united in 1861 and became independent in 1878. The rise of fascism in the 1930s led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a dictatorship in 1940.

            "input": "During the 1950s, several communications researchers realized that there was a need to allow general communication between users of various computers and communications networks. This led to research into decentralized networks, queuing theory, and packet switching. The subsequent creation of ARPANET in the United States in turn catalyzed a wave of technical developments that made it the basis for the development of the Internet. Contrary to popular myth, the DoD did not create the ARPANET so that they could communicate to the US Government after a nuclear war.\\n\\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational in 1984 when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\\n\\nThe collective network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN in Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN in Switzerland. In 1993 the Mosaic web browser version 1.0 was released, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word \"Internet\" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\\n\\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.",

            "input": "classic example\\nSuppose you want to write a function to exchange the values of two integer variables. It seems like that would be fairly trivial. For example, to swap x and y, you could just create an extra int variable, t, and write code that looks like this: \\nt = x;\\nx = y;\\ny = t;\\nThat would certainly work. (Try giving x and y initial values & trace through the code if you don't see why the code works. Note that this approach is similar to what you did for the mandel() function in that programming assignment.)\\n\\nSo, you would probably suppose that you could write a function like this:\\n\\nvoid swap (int x, int y) {\\n      \\n   int t = x;\\n      \\n   x = y;\\n   \\n   y = t;\\n}\\nNow, suppose your main() looks like this:\\n\\nint main(void)\\n{\\n   int a = 5;\\n   \\n   int b = 7;\\n      \\n   swap( a, b );\\n      \\n   printf(\"a is %d and b is %d&#92;n\", a, b);\\n      \\n}\\n      \\nWhat will print? If swap works, we expect \"a is 7 and b is 5\" to print. But what actually happens? When the function swap is called, the values of a and b are passed into the functions. When swap begins, x is initialized to 5 and y is initialized to 7. The values of x and y are swapped...but the values of a and b (in main) are unaffected. The swap function does not work as written above because the arguments were passed 'by value.'\\n\\nWith pointers, we can pass the values 'by reference.' Passing by reference means that we'll pass the addresses of the variables instead of the values. Here's how swap and main should be written:\\n\\nvoid swap ( int *px, int *py) {\\n      \\n   int t = *px;\\n      \\n   *px = *py;\\n      \\n   *py = t;\\n      \\n}\\n      \\nint main(void) \\n{\\n   int a = 5;\\n   \\n   int b = 7;\\n      \\n   swap( &a, &b );\\n      \\n   printf(\"a is %d and b is %d&#92;n\", a, b);\\n      \\n}\\n      \\nNow, the addresses of the variables a and b are passed into swap. In swap, t is set to the value of 'the data that px points to', which is just the value stored at the address of a, which is 5. Then the value stored at address px is changed to the value stored at address py. This sets a to the value of b. Finally, b is set to the value t, which was the value originally stored at a. So, the values of a and b were swapped.",

This will be our starting point.\\n(3) Next, hang a couple of known weights such as paperclips, fishing sinkers, etc, and note how far the band stretches with the given weight attached.  Perform this task for, say, 5 to 10 different weights.  Don't forget to measure and record how far the band stretched for each weight you hang from it.\\n(4) Now, using graph paper, make an x-y plot of the data.  Mark how much weight was used (y-axis) and how far the band stretched (x-axis).\\n(5) Through these data points, a straight line can be drawn which has a calculated slope.  This value of the slope, k, is your force-constant.  Don't worry, this will make sense in a minute.\\n\\nTo calculate the force exerted by the band, use the following equation: F = kx, where F is the exerted (restoring) force, x is the distance the band stretched, and k is the force-constant we calculated.\\n\\nViola!

The results of Bose's work, too, were not accepted by all. There were people who challenged them and even said that there was not much truth in them. Bose gave a lecture at the Linnean Society next year to a gathering of scientists. He explained with suitable experiments how plants respond to stimuli. Even those who had challenged him could not find fault with his experiments or conclusions.\\n\\nThere is an interesting story about a demonstration that Bose gave in England. On that day he wanted to show some new things that he had found out. He had come to the conclusion that plants can feel pain like animals; that when we pinch them they suffer; and that they die in a few minutes after they are poisoned. Bose wanted to show experiments to prove these conclusions. A number of scientists and other leading men and women had gathered to hear him. Bose started the experiments by injecting poison into a plant. The plant should have shown signs of death in a few minutes. On the contrary, nothing happened. The learned audience started laughing. Even at this adverse moment Bose showed admirable calmness. He thought quickly. The poison that he injected into the plant did not kill it. So, he supposed that it would not hurt him also. With full confidence he got ready to inject the poison into himself. At that instant a man got up and confessed that instead of poison he had put similar colored water. Now, Bose conducted the experiment again with real poison, whereupon the plant withered and died as expected.\\n\\nJagadishchandra Bose continued his work and made new discoveries. He found that plants shrink a little during the night. He found out why plants always grow towards light even if they have to bend. He also found out the reason why some plants grow straight and some do not. He explained that this was due to the 'pulsation' in plants. This pulsation quickens by heat and slows down by cold in plants.\\n\\nJagadishchandra Bose did remarkable work, - and scientists outside India had honoured him. Yet there were people who opposed him. As a result even the Royal Society delayed publishing his valuable work in its publications, But nothing could make him give up his work. He was sure that years of research had led him to the truth. So he did not feel that it was very necessary to depend on scientific journals only. He wrote books and published them on his own.\\n\\nBy this time Bose had made a name for himself as a great scientist. The instruments he had developed were being used in some Western countries too. He visited Europe and America in 1907 and 1914; scientific institutions invited him to explain his discoveries. He visited Japan also.\\n\\nMost of us have seen a peculiar kind of plant called the mimosa (touch-me-not') which spreads on the ground. It has very small leaves. It is extremely sensitive. If we just touch one leaf, that leaf and the leaves nearby all fold up. The greater the force we use, the larger the number of leaves which fold up. The whole row of leaves of the branch can be made to fold like this by touching it with a little greater force. Why does only this plant react like this? We have often wondered, haven't we? Bose wondered, too. And he went on to find out. He found that other plants also react to a man's touch in the same way. The only difference is this: We cannot see the reaction of other plants but we can see the reaction of the mimosa. But Bose wanted to study th",

He attended Yale from 1876 to 1882, where he studied medicine and business. Walter Camp was an author, athletic director, chairman of the board of the New Haven Clock Company, and director of the Peck Brothers Company. He was general athletic director and head advisory football coach at Yale University from 1888-1914, and chairman of the Yale football committee from 1888-1912. Camp played football at Yale and helped evolve the rules of the game away from Rugby and Soccer rules into the rules of American Football as we know them today.\\nOne precursor to Walter Camp's influence was William Ebb Ellis, a student at the Rugby School in England. In 1823, Ellis was the first person noted for picking up the ball during the soccer game and running with it, thereby breaking and changing the rules. In 1876, at the Massosoit convention, the the first attempts at writing down the rules of American football were made. Walter Camp edited every American Football rulebook until his death in 1925.\\n\\nWalter Camp contibuted the following changes from Rugby and Soccer to American football: \\n\\none side retained undisputed possession of the ball, until that side gives up the ball as a result of its own violations \\nthe line of scrimmage \\n11 on a team instead of 15 \\ncreated the quarter-back and center positions \\nforward pass \\nstandardized the scoring system, numerical scoring \\ncreated the safety, interference, penalties, and the neutral zone \\ntackling as low as the knee was permitted - 1888 \\na touchdown increased in value to six points and field goals went down to three points - 1912\\nThe NFL or the National Football League, was formed in 1920.",

It actually proposes multiple ways this is possible.\\n\\nMy favorite which I learned in physics class is the fact that velocity warps time.  The closer you get to the speed of light, the slower time moves for you. I've read this, and it is definately true, we had to derive the formula in physics, and calculate the time, lenghth(which decreases with speed), and mass (which increases with speed) distortion as well. The new time which has passed is equal to the time passed of a stationary observer over one minus the square root of velocity squared over the speed of light squared.  The effects of this are very negligable unless you are moving at speeds very very close to the speed of light, at least over 90% of the speed of light, and we haven't gotten anywhere close yet.  But theoretically if you were traveling very close to the speed of light, you could rotate the earth for what seems like days to you and then have years pass on earth, thus in a way traveling into the future.  Also, it gets slower and slower so that it is thought that time would actually stop if you were moving at the speed of light, and so now what happens if you move even faster? Some think it might cause you to go back in time.  It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light, however in his book, Gott discusses looping around strings(the strings from string theory) which warp space time, and discusses ways to \"beat\" light and actually show up someplace before you left.\\n\\nTime definately slows down with velocity, therefore time travel definately occurs, however, i actually have a problem with the time travel of humans.  Because along with time dialating, mass also dialates, and length contracts, if we were to approach speeds significant enough to distort time, our mass would increase and length would decrease.  Now since density is mass over volume, wouldn't that mean that our density would increase dramatically? wouldn't our blood then become so dense and viscous that it prevents blood flow and our cells become deprived of oxygen and we die? Because of this, I find it unlikely that we will ever be able to time travel, but if we can accelerate objects enough, we will probably eventually be able to send other things into the future.",

The following is a quote from American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language at education.yahoo.com. \\n\\n Since the 18th century grammarians have insisted that than should be regarded as a conjunction in all its uses, so that a sentence such as  Bill is taller than Tom  should be construed as an elliptical version of the sentence  Bill is taller than Tom is.  According to this view, the case of a pronoun following than is determined by whether the pronoun serves as the subject or object of the verb that is \"understood.\" Thus, the standard rule requires  Pat is taller than I  (not me) on the assumption that this sentence is elliptical for  Pat is taller than I am  but allows  The news surprised Pat more than me,  since this sentence is taken as elliptical for  The news surprised Pat more than it surprised me.  However, than is quite commonly treated as a preposition when followed by an isolated noun phrase, and as such occurs with a pronoun in the objective case:  John is taller than me.  Though this usage is still widely regarded as incorrect, it is predominant in speech and has reputable literary precedent, appearing in the writing of such respected authors as Shakespeare, Johnson, Swift, Scott, and Faulkner. It is also consistent with the fact that than is clearly treated as a preposition in the than whom construction, as in  a poet than whom (not than who) no one has a dearer place in the hearts of his countrymen.  Still, the writer who risks a sentence like  Mary is taller than him  in formal writing must be prepared to defend the usage against objections of critics who are unlikely to be dissuaded from the conviction that the usage is incorrect.·Comparatives using as . . . as can be analyzed as parallel to those using than. Traditional grammarians insist that  I am not as tall as he  is the only correct form; in formal writing, one should adhere to this rule. However, one can cite both literary precedent and syntactic arguments in favor of analyzing the second as as a preposition (which would allow constructions such as  I am not as tall as him).",

The contents of each page are then analyzed to determine how it should be indexed (for example, words are extracted from the titles, headings, or special fields called meta tags). Data about web pages is stored in an index database for use in later queries. Some search engines, such as Google, store all or part of the source page (referred to as a cache) as well as information about the web pages, whereas some store every word of every page it finds, such as AltaVista. This cached page always holds the actual search text since it is the one that was actually indexed, so it can be very useful when the content of the current page has been updated and the search terms are no longer in it. This problem might be considered to be a mild form of linkrot, and Google's handling of it increases usability by satisfying user expectations that the search terms will be on the returned web page. This satisfies the principle of least astonishment since the user normally expects the search terms to be on the returned pages. Increased search relevance makes these cached pages very useful, even beyond the fact that they may contain data that may no longer be available elsewhere.\"",

Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, Samurai Champloo, Full Metal Alchemist, Full Metal Panic, Inuyasha, Big O, Soul Hunter, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam....all of these are great anime's and I enjoy each of them.

I've always liked the range of emotions that run throughout most anime, and the over the top action is great as well.

Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test. I would recommend getting one of the books, Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard. Read it all the way through. Then take every practice test in the book, then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books. Review every question on your test you got wrong and go back into the book to see what “format” of question it is and review that again. Then use the free CDROM that should come with your prep book to focus in on any sections you are bombing on the practice tests. This worked for me and one of my buddies.

The worst hand in the game is a set of eight, nine and three.

The name was also used because it signified bad fortune, presumably for anyone who went up against the group.\\n\\nIn Japanese legal terminology, yakuza organizations are referred to as Bōryokudan, literally \"violence groups\".

Halogen bulbs are similar to standard bulbs except the bulb is pressurized with halogen gas for more light output. LEDs are not affected either way. As for florescent bulbs, they do require a ballast to initially heat the gas up which DOES take a little more energy to start up than run - but definitely not 30 minutes worth of running.\\n\\nYour air conditioner is a different story. It requires a surge of amperage to start up and uses far less energy to simply run. I still wouldn’t say it compares to 30 minutes worth of constant running though - maybe 10 or so.

I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\\n\\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful.

The problems include accuracy of the media file.

What I started doing was making lists of what needed to be done & always made sure that I put free time on the list as well. You need to find a balance & make the most of the free time that you have available.\\n\\nHere's an example: I listed all of the cleaning chores I needed to accomplish in a month & then worked out how often each needed to be done. When I was finished, I realized that there were really only one or two things each day, so long as I kept to my schedule. I then mapped out time that I could use as free time (which, for me, means without family at home) & worked it into the shcedule. When I hit those times, I just make sure that I do exactly what I want to do & nothing more.\\n\\nThe funny thing is that making yourself adhere to a schedule of sorts for only a few weeks has some amazing effects...I'm now the type of person who will stop to make sure that there is nothing else that needs to be done before I take my \"me\" time. Tell you one thing though, if this house is spotless, dinner is cooked & the laundry is done, you'd best consider how dear your life is to you if you ask me to do something else once I've decided to take my hour or two of solitude!\\n\\nIn the end, you can train yourself to be more productive & to balance free time against what needs to be done. As for real ambition, you might need to consider what goals you have & work toward them slowly. The main trick is accomplishment; if you set goals for yourself, even small ones, & you accomplish them, you will start to make it a habit...accomplishment breeds more accomplishment &, in many ways, ambition & accomplishment are one in the same...\\n\\nHope this helps!",

Let us start the cycle with the piston head top dead center. The intake valve is open and head drops pulling gasoline and air into the cylinder(1st stroke). Next the valves close and due to the rotating crank the piston rises compressing the gas and air(2nd stroke). The sparkplug inites the gas, forcing the piston down (3rd stroke). This explosive force is what moves the car forward. The piston head rises expeling the burnt gas through the exhast valve (4th and last stroke). This leaves the piston in the top dead center position to start the cycle all over again. A car will generaly have four or more cylinders in even numbers (4,6,8, ect.).  while 1st cylinder might be in the 3rd stroke powering the crank shaft, the crank shaft would rotate the other pistons resulting in cylinders 2-4 to experince the strokes (cylinder 2: 4th stroke, cylinder 3: 1st stroke, and cylinder 4: 2nd stroke). Thus there is always one cylinder powering the other cylinders. An eletric starter is used to rotate the crank shaft to intiate the first combustion stroke.  Otherwise how will the pistons move without the intial spark.  Think of the old Ford model T cars and how they had to manualy crank the engine and think of how modern cars start with only a crank of the ignition key. To learn more I recomend researching physics, chemistry, mechanical dynamics, and thermodynamics",

In the resulting Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, Japan becomes an imperial power after ceding Taiwan and the Pescadores from China.\\nAfter the Meiji Restoration and the fall of samurai and the traditional feudal class system, with Commodore Perry's arrival as a catalyst, Japan began rapid modernization and Westernization.  These events see the establishment of Japan as an ultra-nationalist, imperial power, with relatively equal standing amongst the great Western powers of the time.\\nJapan controlled Korea during World War II, and they killed 35 million Chinese, 6 million Koreans, and 1 million Filipinos during their occupation of East Asia.",

As far as I know his work has never been successfully challenged.\\n\\nThe abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839. The Boston newspapers began referring satirically to the local swells as OFM, \"our first men,\" and used expressions like NG, \"no go,\" GT, \"gone to Texas,\" and SP, \"small potatoes.\" \\n\\nMany of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings, a stock in trade of the humorists of the day. One predecessor of OK was OW, \"oll wright,\" and there was also KY, \"know yuse,\" KG, \"know go,\" and NS, \"nuff said.\"\\n\\nMost of these acronyms enjoyed only a brief popularity. But OK was an exception, no doubt because it came in so handy. It first found its way into print in Boston in March of 1839 and soon became widespread among the hipper element. \\n\\nIt didn't really enter the language at large, however, until 1840. That's when Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren adopted it as the name of their political club, giving OK a double meaning. (\"Old Kinderhook\" was a native of Kinderhook, New York.) \\n\\nOK became the warcry of Tammany hooligans in New York while beating up their opponents. It was mentioned in newspaper stories around the country.\\n\\nVan Buren's opponents tried to turn the phrase against him, saying that it had originated with Van Buren's allegedly illiterate predecessor, Andrew Jackson, a story that has survived to this day. They also devoted considerable energy to coming up with unflattering interpretations, e.g., \"Out of Kash, Out of Kredit, and Out of Klothes.\" \\n\\nNewspaper editors and publicists around the country delighted in coming up with even sillier interpretations-- Oll Killed, Orfully Konfused, Often Kontradicts, etc.--so that by the time the campaign was over the expression had taken firm root nationwide.",

The Gestapo were also responsible for some actions in the Holocaust, including mass executions before the use of mass-creamation.

As a political movement, communism seeks to establish a classless society. A major force in world politics since the early 20th century, modern communism is generally associated with The Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, according to which the capitalist profit-based system of private ownership is replaced by a communist society in which the means of production are communally owned. According to Marxism, this process may be initiated by the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie, then passes through a transitional state period marked by the preparatory stage of socialism known as the dictatorship of the proletariat. Pure communism which is stateless has never been implemented, it remains theoretical: communism is, in Marxist theory, the end-state, or the result of state-socialism. The word is now mainly understood to refer to the political, economic, and social theory of Marxist thinkers, or life under conditions of Communist party rule. Other thinkers that were predecessors or contemporaries of Marx, such as several anarchists, called themselves communist, but had alternate methods to Marxism to reach a classless society.\\n\\nNations that are currently communist:\\n1.

The head of the animal is similar to that of a lion while the rest of the body carries similarities to leopards.\\n\\nThe first documented Leopon appears to be that bred at Kolhapur, India in 1910. Its skin was sent to R I Pocock by Mr W S Millard, the Hon Secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society. It was a cross between a large leopard and a lioness. Two cubs were born, one of which died aged 2.5 months and the other was still living when Pocock described it in 1912. Pocock wrote that it was spotted like a leopard, but that the spots on its sides were smaller and closer set than those of an Indian leopard and were brown and indistinct like the fading spots of a juvenile lion. The spots on the head, spine, belly and legs were black and distinct. The tail was spotted on the topside and striped underneath and had a blackish tip with longer hairs. The underside was dirty white, the ears were fawn and had a broad black bar but did not have the white spot found in leopards. Pocock wrote that the closest he had previously seen to this type of hybrid was the lijagulep (Congolese Spotted Lion) bred in Chicago.\\n\\nThey have been bred in zoos in Japan, Germany and Italy (the latter was a \"reverse leopon\" i.e. from a male lion and female leopardess). Karl Hagenbeck, who produced many different hybrids, recorded the birth of leopons at the Hamburg Tierpark in Germany, but none survived to maturity. A leopon skin and skull at the British Museum comes from the animal bred at Kolhapur Zoo in India and was donated by Lt. Col. F.W. Wodehouse of the Junior United Services sometime between 1920 and 1940.\\n\\nThe most successful leopon programme was at Koshien Hanshin Park in Nishinomiya City, Japan. A lioness called Sonoko was mated by a leopard called Kaneo. The lioness voluntarily assumed a position on her side to allow the much smaller leopard to mount her. A litter of 2 hybrids was born in 1959 and 3 more were born in 1962. In captivity, the normally solitary male leopard remained with the family (social behaviour is sometimes seen in captive specimens of normally solitary big cats). The hybrids proved to be sterile and the last one died in 1985. The programme of cross-breeding was popular with the public, but it was criticised in zoological and animal welfare circles.\\n\\nBased on the data from the Japanese cats, leopons are larger than leopards and combine features from the leopard and lion. They have brown, rather than black, spots and tufted tails. They will climb like leopards and seem to enjoy water, also like the leopard (oddly enough, the Japanese leopons were born of a water-loving lioness and a male leopard that did not seem to like water!). Male leopons may have sparse manes about 20cm long . Females may be torn between the solitary nature of the leopard and the social nature of a lioness.\\n\\nP L Florio published a report \"Birth of a Lion x Leopard Hybrid in Italy\" in 1983 (this refers to the \"reverse leopon\" also known as a lipard or liard)\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nThe Pumapard is a hybrid of male puma and female leopard. Three sets of these hybrids were bred in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Karl Hagenbeck at his animal park in Hamburg, Germany. Most did not reach adulthood. One of these was purchased in 1898 by Berlin Zoo. A similar hybrid has been reported by Helmut Hemmer. These hybrids had puma-like long tails and sandy or tawny coats with chestnut leopard-like markings and puma-like cheek markings. Another was described as resembling a little grey puma with large brown rosettes.\\n\\nPumapards inherit a form of dwarfism and grow to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body, but short legs.\\n\\nOne is preserved in the Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring and clearly shows the tendency to dwarfism. There are colour images of the preserved pumapard at Hybri",

And Einstein's special theory of relativity shows us that all light is made of waves.  And these two theories combine in interesting ways, but don't completely gel.  For decades physicists have been struggling to reconcile the two theories, but they have been unable to do so effectively.  Something was always holding them back, basically because the universe seems to be holding more energy than there is space in the points of known mass.  This made scientists wonder where all the energy was.  And then they discovered, that the space in between the atoms was itself teeming with life.  And the life that lives at the bottom of all matter, inside the shell of the tiniest waves of photons, or quanta, is a strange world of simultaneously vibrating strings.  And those strings of multi-demensional vibrating pulsating energy play in a kind of metaphysical choir, creating all the intricacies of mass and energy in the universe, as if these tiny little strings were conductors conducting a vast symphony, only they were conducting that symphony with the conductors of all the other symphonies of the atoms they were orchestrating with.  And those collections of atoms and molecules and other interesting bits were actually being played by an army of conductors conducting simultaneously with an entire legion of instruments singing and strumming away.\\n\\nString theory is mind-bogglingly wild, because it's so advanced.  It took PBS three hours to explain it completely, and I was still lost.  Only when I completed the book about the show's research did I have a deeper grasp of it.  Basically you just need to know that these little strings that vibrate in 6, up to 10 dimensions (depending on whose theory applies to that particular \"particle\" - I told you, it's mind-blowing)  and how they vibrate impacts what manifests on the level of perceptible reality.\\n\\nWhat's so incredible about this is that science is finally catching up to philosophy.  The Middle Way, or what Huxley called the Perennial Philosophy, has always told us that the perception of life is merely the perception of imperceptible changes on a fundamental and/or spiritual nature, and the manifestation of those changes in the world that we see around us.  In many traditional cultures, those changes are manipulated by otherworldy figures, gods, angels and the like, which is outside the scope of scientists to discern, but in today's physics, the wall between the reality we see and the reality that is real is paper-thin.  Scientists are beginning to discover that everything truly is everything, and once they can prove it, life can get a whole lot more sane, because folks will have realized that what we are today is what we were twenty thousand years ago, we are one indescribable circle trailing itslef through time, perhaps even creating subtle vibrations that resonate with other vibrating universes that themselves are creating a reality in a world far, far different than this one, beyond all perceptible consciousness.  Perhaps, there may even be a heaven, in which all this is taking place and yet life is going on and on and on, without fear or violence or pain.\\n\\nEnjoy your continuing discovery of the details behind string theory.

I will first say that the Mandelbrot set does not really have any direct practical value.\\n\\nThe mandelbrot set like other fractals is interesting, in that they are calculated out in iterations, and the number of iterations used determines whether or not a point is in the set.  To give an example, you know that if you define a function 2=x+y, you take any two values for x and y and see if they fit that function.  x=2, y=3 is not a point that fits this function, whicle x=0.5, y=1.5 does fit this function.\\n\\nWith the Mandelbrot set, you cannot look at a point and see if it fits the function.  The way the madelbrot set is formed is to place imaginary numbers on one axis, real numbers on the other, and define the points as follows:\\n\\nfor any complex number z, such that z=z^2 + 1, iterated over and over does not ever exceed 2, that number z is part of the set.\\n\\nThere is only one way to determine if a number z is part of the set and that is to say, we are going to do a certain number of iterations, and if z<2 at the end of our calculations, that z is part of the set, otherwise it is not.  This means that whether or not a complex number is part of the madelbrot set depends on the number of iterations you use in your inclusion criteria for z.  There is no absolute answer to the question \"Is z a part of the madelbrot set?\"\\n\\nSO yes the Mandelbrot set does go on forever, and the more iterations used in calculating it, the more detailed the fractal gets.",

And the mere thought that just because they are gay that they will 'fool around' with their kids is completely ludicrous. By that logic, a heterosexual father would molest his daughter and a heterosexual mother her son. The people who want to adopt have to go through the same strict standards that heterosexual couples go through (if not more strict) so they are actually putting effort into trying to raise a child- so they are not taking it lightly and wouldnt do anything to have the child taken away.

Others say that he became her favorite hunting companion, but offended Apollo, who loosed a giant scorpion to chase Orion into the sea. Apollo then tricked Artemis into shooting Orion. When she discovered what she had done, she gave way to her grief and immortalized her companion and the scorpion by placing them in the heavens as constellations.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrion, in astronomy, constellation located on the celestial equator.

It is often associated with the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, and plays a major role in Western society. The principles of separation of church and state in the United States and Laïcité in France draw heavily on secularism.\\n\\n\\nDefinition\\nAs secularism is often used in different contexts, its precise definition can vary from place to place. In philosophy, secularism is the belief that life can be best lived by applying ethics, and the universe best understood, by processes of reasoning, without reference to a god or gods or other supernatural concepts. Secularism in this sense was coined by George Jacob Holyoake and is one of the precursors of modern secular humanism.\\n\\nWhen applied to society, secularism is considered to be any of a range of situations where a society less automatically assumes religious beliefs to be either widely shared or a basis for conflict in various forms, than in recent generations of the same society. In this sense secularism is linked to the sociological concept of secularization and may be upheld as an academic thesis, rather than advocated as a desirable state of affairs.\\n\\nIn government, secularism means a policy of avoiding entanglement between government and religion (ranging from reducing ties to a state religion to promoting secularism in society), of non-discrimination among religions (providing they don't deny primacy of civil laws), and of guaranteeing human rights of all citizens, regardless of the creed (and, if conflicting with certain religious rules, by imposing priority of the universal human rights).\\n\\nSecularism can also mean the practice of working to promote any of those three forms of secularism. It should not be assumed that an advocate of secularism in one sense will also be a secularist in any other sense. It is also important to remember that secularism does not necessarily equate to atheism; indeed, many secularists have counted themselves among the religious.\\n\\nThe antonym of secularism is usually theocracy, which is a form of government where religion often plays a major or dominant role.",

When the behavior is inflexible, maladaptive, and antisocial, then that individual is diagnosed with a personality disorder. \\n\\n \\n\\nMost personality disorders begin as problems in personal development and character which peak during adolescence and then are defined as personality disorders. \\n\\n \\n\\nPersonality disorders are not illnesses in a strict sense as they do not disrupt emotional, intellectual, or perceptual functioning.  However, those with personality disorders suffer a life that is not positive, proactive, or fulfilling.  Not surprisingly, personality disorders are also  associated with failures to reach potential.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe DSM-IV-TR: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, defines a personality disorder as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectation of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.\\n\\n \\n\\nCurrently, there are 10 distinct personality disorders identified in the DSM-IV:\\n\\nAntisocial Personality Disorder:  Lack of regard for the moral or legal standards in the local culture, marked inability to get along with others or abide by societal rules.  Sometimes called psychopaths or sociopaths. \\n\\nAvoidant Personality Disorder:  Marked social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and extremely sensitive to criticism. \\n\\nBorderline Personality Disorder:  Lack of one's own identity, with rapid changes in mood, intense unstable interpersonal relationships, marked impulsively, instability in affect and in self image. \\n\\nDependent Personality Disorder:  Extreme need of other people, to a point where the person is unable to make any decisions or take an independent stand on his or her own. Fear of separation and submissive behavior. Marked lack of decisiveness and self-confidence. \\n\\nHistrionic Personality Disorder:  Exaggerated and often inappropriate displays of emotional reactions, approaching theatricality, in everyday behavior. Sudden and rapidly shifting emotion expressions. \\n\\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder:  Behavior or a fantasy of grandiosity, a lack of empathy, a need to be admired by others, an inability to see the viewpoints of others, and hypersensitive to the opinions of others. \\n\\nObsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder:  Characterized by perfectionism and inflexibility; preoccupation with uncontrollable patterns of thought and action. \\n\\nParanoid Personality Disorder:  Marked distrust of others, including the belief, without reason, that others are exploiting, harming, or trying to deceive him or her; lack of trust; belief of others' betrayal; belief in hidden meanings; unforgiving and grudge holding. \\n\\nSchizoid Personality Disorder:  Primarily characterized by a very limited range of emotion, both in expression of and experiencing; indifferent to social relationships. \\n\\nSchizotypal Personality Disorder:   Peculiarities of thinking, odd beliefs, and eccentricities of appearance,  behavior, interpersonal style, and thought (e.g., belief in psychic phenomena and having magical powers). \\n\\nAccording to Dr. Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self-Love: Narcissism Revisited, individuals with personality disorders have many things in common (see The Interrelationship Between Personality Disorders):\\n\\nSelf-centeredness that manifests itself through a me-first, self-preoccupied attitude \\n\\nLack of individual accountability that results in a victim mentality and blaming others, society and the univ",

For example, anyone with common sense and the ability to do a little research will know that Christ was NOT born on December 25th. Even non-Jehovah's Witnesses know that.) \\n\\nThey are not a cult. Cults have human leaders, Jehovah's Witnesses' leader is Christ Jesus. \\n\\nA careful examination of the various holidays celebrated today will show that they can be traced back to pagan false-religious worship. The pagans did not worship God and did not engage in practices that God approved of. The Bible only commands Christians to observe ONE celebration: the death of Christ. Not his birth, not his resurrection....only his death. If his birth was meant to be celebrated, don't you think it would be a Biblical command? And since we're not commanded to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, why would we take it upon ourselves to celebrate the birth of anyone else? \\n\\nThe only 2 mentions of birthday celebrations in the scriptures were by those who did not worship God, and in both instances there was a murder at each. In the second one, it was one of God's own servants who was put to death, John the Baptizer.\\n\\nGod, through the Bible, tells us just how we are to live and what form of worship is acceptable to him. He also tells us what should be celebrated, which, as said already, is simply the death of his Son. \\n\\nJehovah's Witnesses firmly adhere to the Holy Scriptures for all of their beliefs.

Immigration is voluntary and the prescriptions and exclusions are minimal. Colonization, on the other hand, is involuntary and prescriptions and exclusions are maximized.

Di Stéfano was a powerful forward with endless stamina and great tactical versatility, able to switch positions with ease, although he nominally played as an attacking forward. Di Stéfano is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. Today, he is honorary president of Real Madrid.\\n\\nBorn to a family of Italian immigrants, Di Stéfano's career started with River Plate in Argentina, in 1943. He won six league titles in the first 12 years of his career in Argentina and Colombia (playing for the Millonarios in Bogota) before moving to Spain.\\n\\nDi Stefano was involved in a protracted dispute between Real Madrid and Barcelona in order to determine who would be able to count on his services. Many Barcelona fans maintain that Franco's government influenced the move, but others contest that this is an excuse used to justify the success he later attained with Real Madrid (and not with Barcelona). What is fact is that DiStefano was first 'discovered' in Spain while playing for Millonarios de Bogota in a friendly tournament to celebrate Real Madrid's 50th anniversary. Real Madrid and Barcelona began negotiating, Real Madrid with his current club, Millonarios, and Barcelona with his previous club, River Plate. Under FIFA regulations the league in Colombia was 'renegade' and Barcelona thought they had secured the transfer by negotiating with River, although the player had no desire to honor this contract which in his mind had expired years ago. In the end the Spanish government stepped in with a Salomonic solution which Barcelona did not agree to, and forfeited their rights, allowing Real Madrid to sign the player. He went on to revolutionize Real Madrid and lead them through their most succesful period, winning numerous Spanish League and Cup titles as well as five consecutive European Cups.\\n\\nAfter retirement, he moved into coaching. With Di Stéfano as coach, Valencia won the Spanish Cup in 1979, but he led Real Madrid to second place in five tournaments in 1983, losing the league title on the last day and being defeated in four cup finals!\\n\\nDi Stéfano is currently the 3rd highest scorer in the history of Spain's top division, with 228 goals in 329 games, behind Hugo Sánchez (234 goals) and Telmo Zarra (251). Di Stéfano is also Real Madrid's highest league goalscorer of all time, with 216 goals in 282 league matches between 1953 and 1964.\\n\\nDi Stéfano was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.\\n\\nOn Christmas Eve 2005, Di Stefano suffered a heart attack at the age of 79.",

They know that God's purpose has not changed and that in the very near future, God will be intervening in mankind's affairs to the point of destroying all earthly governments and using his Kingdom (currently presided over by his Son, Jesus) to usher in the world that humans were meant to have. \\n\\nJehovah's Witnesses, again, are NOT a cult, they do not brainwash its members, they simply explain Bible teachings to people in a way that is easy to understand and will help them to appreciate that living by Jehovah God's standards as set forth in the Bible is the only way to have a truly happy and successful life.

There has been one major problem with Ipv4, it is running out of IP addresses (IP addresses are a unique identifirer for a computer on the internet). \\n\\nIpv6 fixes this problem along with many other more insugnificant problems. Ipv6 also adds many iprovments to Ipv4 in ares such as routing and network autoconfiguration. Ipv6 is supposed to replace Ipv4 in a gradually time frame, with the two coexisting for many years. \\n\\nA Ipv4 address looks like this 10.1.1.1 and a Ipv6 address looks like this FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210. Ipv6 supports addresses which are four times the number of bits as Ipv4 addresses (128 vs. 32). This is 4 Billion times 4 Billion times 4 Billion (2^^96) times the size of the Ipv4 address space (2^^32). This works out to be: 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 This is an extremely large address space.

Security more to Ipv6’s superiority. Encrypting along with authentication are excelent features of Ipv6 that Ipv4 couldn’t offer, and offers security headers. IPv6 also allows a sender and a receiver to establish a high-quality, high-bandwith secure pathbetween each other.\\n\\nInfact, there is also a term called IPv8, which might take good number of years to execute.

Moisture and minute fractions of organic matterfound in even the cleanest treated municipal water areenough to initiate and sustain biofilm.Biofilm is known to exist on any surface, smooth orotherwise, where factors for microbial growth are suitable,including pH and temperature. Examples of materials thathave known to give rise to biofilm include stainless steel,glass, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),plumbing and evenleafy vegetables. In some instances, the substrate itself can\\n\\nprovide organic nutrition for biofilm development, such as plasticizers used in polymer formulations or trace metal nutrients from metallic components.\\nThe propensity for microorganisms to form biofilm on\\nvirtually any surface presents a formidable challenge to maintaining sanitary conditions, especially as the film becomes more established. The resistance of biofilm to sanitizers increases over time as the film matures.\\nLayers of microorganisms have an insulating effect fromsanitizers and the elements, with the outermost reaches protecting the layers of organisms below. When transforming from free-floating organisms to tethered, or sessile, organisms, the protein framework of the cell walls can evolve, hindering some sanitizers by masking or modifying the target sought by the antibiotic.

But you could sleep with 2 people and have an STD and sleep with 100 with no STD. The person that slept with 2 may have never used protection for one thing and the one that slept with 100 may have always used protection. We have to look at all facts before we judge a person. So numbers in itself mean nothing in regard to STDs. I mean if she started having sex at 15 and slept with one person a year which is kind of low if she never had a steady boyfriend (and a lot of people dont) then she would have slept with 10 people. So basically if that same story held true she would have had to sleep with 6 people a year to have slept with 60 people by age 25. Which is not a lot theoretically. After all most people do date a lot within their dating span. I have only slept with 9 women in my lifetime and I am 35. But I dated a slew of women. If I had to throw a figure out there I would say I dated at least 25 women a year. if they were not my type or I saw things were going bad I cut my losses and just left rather than staying and wasting my time.

That’s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since, fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition[not the healthiest though]. The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer. \\n\\nBefore I continue let me explain protein, carbohydrates, and fats.\\n\\nProtein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken, fish, sirloin, and milk. \\n\\nCarbohydrates [carbs] can be found almost in anything else even apples.\\nGood carbs:\\nApples, wheat bread, sourdough bread, grains, and wheat \\nBad carbs:\\nWhite bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, Doritos, and sodas!\\n\\nGood fats:\\nAvocados, pecans, almonds, and peanut butter \\n\\nThe ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like\\n[50%Protien:40%Carbs:10%fat]\\n\\nThis can sound meaningless. So in plain terms consume only good fats [portioned] and you should be okay.  Something like a handful of almonds, or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [separately. not consecutively]. \\n\\nThe reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [Proteins are 4 calories, Carbs are 4 calories, Fats are 9 calories] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more. \\n\\nAnother nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself. That’s how the Adkins basically works. If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight. I leave to you to decide if this is good you.\\n\\nI would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals. [warning: it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount. Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.\\n\\nYou are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [if you have been starving yourself or if you don’t exercise].",

It is rare, but sometimes having warts can cause a woman to have a pap smear that is not normal, (including changes that may lead to cancer).

The early Judeans opposed Greek and Roman oppression and occupation and responded by targeting the fabric of their society by making Laws or interpreting laws (e.g. idol worship became blasphemous, homosexuality became an abomination and women were not to be treated as slaves - tho the Bible records periods when this was not the case - and some traditions continued to view women as second class citizens).\\n\\nThen came the Christian era.\\n\\nThis semi-monotheistic faith saw the bible as a pic-n-mix. One minute the Law dictated to Moses at Mount Sinai is what makes you a sinner and you dont need the Law anyway cos belief in Jesus is all that is required, the next your actions and behaviour are all important when certain things offend Paul (e.g. women and homosexuals).\\n\\nIf it werent for Pauline Christianity, Christianity today would either follow the Law more closely like Judaism (and thus still be a sect of Judaism) or it would have only two rules (love God and your neighbour) and no Law.\\n\\nThe reason for this schism is the dilemma that faced Paul. On the one hand, Paul sought to form a new religion (after his attempts to 'convert' Jews were unsuccessful) but also needed the \"old\" one for legitimacy (it was the one God of Israel that gave the Law at Mount Sinai, how could Paul - a mere mortal - cancel the Law of God given to man at Mount Sinai? Interestingly in the original Greek texts, one way Paul got around this was to express that he was the reincarnation of Jesus and therefore also the son of God).\\n\\nIf you want to read more on whether it was Jesus or Paul who invented Christianity, see the links below.\\n\\nFinally, I'd like to say that whatever people believe about your sexuality, it is just their belief. You should stick two fingers up to them and get on with your life. There's a reason you were created the way you were - it's just a shame these religions can't appreciate that.

Robert Aldrich was originally pegged to direct but Robert Mitchum, who had worked with Aldrich on the dismal The Angry Hills (1959), had him replaced by Pollack.\\n\\nThough now dated, \"The Yakuza\" remains a rich and poignant look at Japan during its transition from its role in the war and the US occupation to the ecconomic powerhouse of the 1980s.

Also, veneers replace ALL teeth in the mouth, whereas crowns are usually placed one at a time as needed.  The purpose of the veneer is to give an entirely new shape to each tooth, thereby making a new mouth.  It's like getting dentures without having all your teeth pulled.

For example, in the liner notes of the 1972 anthology album Nuggets, critic and guitarist Lenny Kaye uses the term \"punk-rock\" to refer to the Sixties \"garage rock\" groups, as well as some of the darker and more primitive practitioners of 1960s psychedelia. Shortly after the time of those notes, Lenny Kaye formed a band with avant-garde poet Patti Smith. Smith's group, and her first album, Horses, released in 1975, directly inspired many of the mid-1970s punk rockers, so this suggests one path by which the term migrated to the music we now know as punk.\\n\\nIn addition to the inspiration of those \"garage bands\" of the 1960s, the roots of punk rock draw on the abrasive, dissonant style of The Velvet Underground; the rebellious attitide and free spirit of The Doors and the snotty attitude and aggressive instrumentation of The Who and the early Rolling Stones; the sexuality, political confrontation, and surreal violence of Detroit bands The Stooges and MC5; the UK pub rock scene and political UK underground bands such as Mick Farren and the Deviants; the New York Dolls, and some British \"glam rock\" or \"art rock\" acts of the early 1970s, including David Bowie, Mott the Hoople and Roxy Music.",

This is where your trapezius and scapular muscles are located. Many headachs and migrains will start from the cervical spine so by releasing that tension even along your ocippital ridge will help reduce the pain. Every reflexologist is diffrent but it is important to get the work done. I have learned diffrent points and styles of reflexology and the best and most effective method was from Dr. Manzanares.

Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\\n\\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\\n\\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?",

Also, some students find doing drills boring.  I think everyone should learn math this way.  A little boredom now can prevent many years of frustration later.\\n\\nThe problem with current public education is that most students get to high school without having mastered the basics.  Students who get 80% correct on a test in fractions or multiplication will move forward to the next subject.  That type of automatic promotion dooms them to a cycle of frustration.  If you give a class of 10th graders a test in 7th grade level math, most will not get 100% correct, or even 90%.  There's no way they'll ever do well in math if they're lacking in fundamental skills.

            "input": "Encapsulation is often confused with information hiding. However, these terms are not interchangeable. Encapsulation is the ability to bundle related data and functionality within a single, autonomous entity called a class. For example, a class called LoggerFile might bundle data members such as the log file's path; a buffer of data waiting to be written to that file; and member functions that open, read, write, and close that file, as in the following code listing:\\n\\nclass LogFile\\n{\\npublic:\\n int Open();\\n int Read(char *buff);\\n int Write(const char *buff);\\n int Close();\\nprivate:\\n FILE *logfile;\\n bool _open;\\n//...additional data members\\n};In procedural languages such as C, you declare these data members and the associated functions separately. Consequently, a global function that opens a log file may be mistakenly called to open a file that has already been opened. Worse yet, users might delete a log file and then attempt to write to it. By bundling the data and functionality in an autonomous class, it's much easier to avert such human errors, because the class maintains the state of the file and is therefore able to prevent such errors.\\n\\nAbstract classes can be used to define the C++ version of interfaces. A C++ abstract class describes functionality shared by objects of all concrete classes that are explicitly listed (perhaps indirectly) as subclasses. An object may play multiple roles by inheriting and implementing multiple interfaces. (The language doesn't directly support notions that an object may play different roles at different times, or that a role is implemented by a collection of objects, but these effects can usually be had in one way or another.) \\n\\nC++ interface-style abstract classes take an idiomatic form: \\n\\nclass AnInterface {\\npublic:\\n  virtual T1   aService(T2, T3) = 0;\\n  ...\\n  virtual T4   anAttribute() const = 0; // get value\\n  virtual void anAttribute(T4) = 0;     // set value\\n  ...\\n  virtual T5   aReadOnlyAttribute() const = 0;\\n\\n  virtual ~AnInterface() {}\\n\\nprotected:\\n  AnInterface() {}\\n};\\n\\nIdeally, the types T should consist only of pass-by-value scalar types (int, float, enum, ...), collections of them (structs, ...) and/or pointers to objects of classes also defined via abstract classes (thus representing handles). The lack of native by-value string and array types in C++ is a problem here. One occasionally attractive alternative is to always contain fixed arrays in structs. But in practice, you can make ADT-style types work OK too. This way you can sometimes obtain simpler mechanics and also avoid value copying. ADT-style fake pointer classes may also be used instead of raw pointers for handle types, although there is no perfect way to do this. \\n\\nAbstract classes sometimes lend themselves to parameterization over some type used in one or more signatures. (Some nice examples are described in Barton and Nachman's book.) Beyond the template prefix, nothing much changes except for the pragmatic problems of dealing with templates in C++. These include for example the fact that template instantiation errors are not usually reported until link time. This is best combatted by prefacing each template with a brief comment about what operations are assumed to be supported on the type (e.g., a < comparison). \\n\\nSince interface classes cannot be directly instantiated, yet serve as virtual base classes for implementations, the constructors should take no arguments and should be listed as protected. Also, for similar reasons, abstract classes should have a no-op virtual destructor, not one listed as ... = 0. Depending on your compiler, you might need to define the no-op constructor and destructor operations outside the class declaration in a separate .C file. \\n\\nThe use of const here and elsewhere has its ups and downs. Officially, it is a good idea, since it helps enforce some of the intended semantic guarantees. But often enough, pragmatic concerns get in the ",

Hardware RAID is implemented by a hardware RAID controller, which is either part of your motherboard, or an add-in card. Software RAID is implemented by the operating system. Software RAID is slower than hardware RAID, but if you have a reasonably fast processor, it's not using terribly much slower. If you have a slow processor, it will be slower, and more importantly, it will put a big load on your processor and make everything run slowly.\\n\\nTo the best of my knowledge, there are no RAID controllers that will RAID an SATA drive with a PATA drive, but you can set up whatever RAID you want with software RAID. If you already have your drives in hardware RAID (and intend to keep them that way) then when you do this, you will be RAIDing the already-existing hardware RAIDs, since a hardware RAID is treated as a single drive on the \"software level\".\\n\\nHere's some info on software RAID in Windows:\\n\\nhttp://www.techimo.com/articles/index.pl?photo=149\\n\\nHere's some info on software RAID in GNU/Linux:\\n\\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html\\n\\nHere's some info on software RAID in Mac OS X:\\n\\nhttp://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/softraid3.html\\n\\nYou can find abundant info on doing software RAID on these and other operating systems by entering \"software RAID\" together with name of the operating system in a search engine.",

Most of these companies also offer from their websites free scans of your computer without installing any software. \\n\\nAs for commercially available, I would stick with the well known companies that will stand behind their product and give you decent support if needed.  E.G. Norton AntiVirus, McAfee Virus Scan, and CA eTrust EZ Antivirus.\\n\\nI have never run multiple anti-virus packages at the same time.  I suspect some combinations will work but I would be hesitate to do this as this type of software is pervasive (i.e., installing and hooking into all parts of your system) and could cause more harm than help.  If this is something you're set on doing I would strongly recommend you find or get in writing from each company that makes the software that you plan on running can indeed run simultaneously. \\n\\nThe best things to do to prevent viruses is somewhat hard to answer without knowing things like what type of e-mail application you use, your level of experience, etc.  Starting with e-mail, the most common medium for viruses, you'll have better protection from e-mail viruses when using web based applications (e.g. Yahoo, Hotmail, and just about most major ISPs) vs. applications that are installed on your computer, such as Outlook or Outlook Express.  Reason being the e-mail stays on their server vs. being loaded down on your computer.  They get the virus not you.  Also, be very cautious about opening ANY attachment.  This is mostly common sense.  If you don't recognize the sender and have no idea why you're getting the e-mail in the first place, don't even open the e-mail let alone the attachment.  Don't forget to also delete the e-mail from your Trash can or Deleted folder.  If you know the sender but not sure why there's an attachment, once again, don't open it.  If you know for a fact why you're getting the e-mail AND the attachment, then and only then would I take the next step and that's use your antivirus software to scan it before opening it. \\n\\nAlso be judicious about what websites you visit.  Don't just click on any link from an e-mail or another website unless you know where it's going to take you.  Ask yourself is it really that important (i.e., worth the risk) I go to this website?  This is where a good firewall application helps out.  \\n\\nTo wrap this up I would recommend one final thing to consider.  Look at securing your entire computer and not just for viruses.  Consider looking into purchasing an entire security suite from one company (vs. independent software companies) as they usually provide antivirus, firewall, anti-spam and anti-spyware software.  (E.g. CA Internet Security Suite, Norton Internet Security, etc.)  Pros: More for your money, better overall protection, and most important, software applications that have been tested together and proven to work together.  Who needs the headache of an application corrupting another; uninstall and re-installing; hours on phone with support; etc.     \\n\\nHTH and good luck!",

Others call it \"metaphysical arithmatic.\" But, in fact, numerology is simply the study of numbers and their symbolic meanings. Numerologists believe that every number (and every letter, too) has special significance. The most significant numbers are associated with the birth date and the letters of a person's name (which are easily converted to numbers). Learning to interpret this language of numbers can reveal basic personality patterns and hidden talents. It can enhance the quality of life and lead to better decision-making skills.\\n\\nThe analytical system known as numerology is between three thousand and five thousand years old. Ancient civilzations such as the Chaldeans, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Mayans, the Chinese, and the Greeks strongly believed in the power of numbers, and each culture developed a system to interpret the significance of numbers and apply it to daily life.\\n\\nThe numerology system primarily used today was originally established by Pythagoras of Samos, a Greek philosopher born circa 580 B. C. Pythagoras, known in history as the Father of Mathematics, traveled widely in his quest to uncover the secrets of numbers and their relationship to universal truths. Pythagoras is said to have built his very complex philosophy on a simple premise: \"Everything is [a] number, and to know numbers is to know thyself.\"\\n\\nNumerology also is closely tied with and plays an important part in the Tarot, the Major Arcana especially. The Major Arcana is numbered from 0 to 21 with each number corresponding to the meaning of the card. The Birthday Number section of this page gives descriptions of the meaning of the numbers 1-31. The meanings of the numbers 1-21 are the same as the meanings of the corresponding cards of the Major Arcana.\\n\\nYou have many personal numbers in Numerology, just as you have many personal signs in Astrology. These numbers are your Life Path number, Character number, Heart's Desire number, Image number, Power number, and Birthday number. There is also a general Daily Vibration number which depends on the day and is therefore the same for everyone. \\n\\nYou have to give your bday dude... and btw its been 3 months already...",

We Christians believe that God created angels to serve him and glorify him.  In this passage, they are singing his praises, as they do constantly in heaven (Revelation 4:8 and similar).

Because the God who dwells in heaven has come to earth in the form of God-made-man Jesus, the Messiah.\\n\\nSo, they give him glory as they were created to do.  They also show his glory to the shepherds.

Is God merciful and kind?  Vengeful and Angry?  Is He simply a Creator that allows man to choose his own path or does he have our destiny mapped out for us?\\nAfter that- another hard choice- the afterlife.  Do you believe in one at all?  Is there a heaven?  if so, is there a hell?  Do you believe a soul can be reincarnated?\\nMy suggestion is to actually write these questions and answers down on paper to give yourself a very clear picture of your beliefs.  Think of as many theological questions and theories that are important to you and actually put them into words.  Then- RESEARCH.  I would say go to a clergy member, pastor etc but if you do remember they are only going to give you THEIR beliefs and teachings, not what you may consider your own.  So if you seek advice from a third party, take everything from a skeptics point of view unless you find someone that says EVERYTHING you've written down as your core beliefs. (Chances are- you won't)\\nTry the internet, library, bookstore- whatever nonpartial resources you can find.\\nLastly, keep an open mind.  Don't write down \"I believe in the Bible so I must be Christian\".  Judaism believes in the Old Testament of the Bible; Mormons believe in both the Old and the New Testamants but have a Third testament as well.  Wiccans don't believe in the Christian Bible, but have many of the same core beliefs as \"love thy neighbor\".

Jesus would only do miracles for those who had the faith in Him. Look at his meeting with Harod. Harod was glad to see Jesus and hoped that He would do a miracle for him, but Jesus would not. God's plan was not to \"impress\" people. Jesus had specific reasons for doing and not doing miracles. Jesus was in His hometown and everyone questioned Him and doubted His authority. He could have done a big SPFX thing, but that would not bring the kind of faith and belief He desired. Who was the person that Jesus was most impressed with?

So it has become one.

Each number within the set is known as an \"octet\". The number A would be referred to as the \"first octet\", B would be the \"Second Octet\" and so on.\\n\\nIPv4 uses Classful addressing; this means that certain groupings or \"Classes\" are used to segregate addresses for specific uses. The classes are usually broken down as follows:\\n\\nClass A (which comprises a first octet of 0-127) addresses use only the first octet to refer to the network, all other octets are used in a hierarchial manner to provide a vast number of hosts (Roughly 16 million hosts are available).\\nNNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH\\n\\nClass B addresses use the first two octets as a network address. They comprise first octet numbers 128-191. They provide less hosts than the Class A addresses and are better for smaller organizations. \\nNNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH\\n\\nClass C addresses use the first three octets as a network designator, providing only 254 useable host addresses. These are perfect for small organization use, or small private networks.\\n\\nSubnets are created by using a \"subnet mask\", or an IP address that uses the binary address to indicate whether or not a specific bit is used as a network address or a host address. This allows network administrators to further identify their individual machines.\\n\\nFor example; One of my clients uses the 10.x.x.x Class A private network schema. They use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 That looks like this:\\nNNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH\\n11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\\n\\nAny space where there is a 1, the network will steal those bits from the \"host\" space and use it to designate a \"network\". My client uses the second octet to differentiate between departments, and the third octet to differentiate between types of machines. IE: 10.15.133.25 is a printer in accounting, 10.15.x.x being Accounting's address space, and 10.x.133.x being all printers in the building.\\n\\nSubnetting allows for greater control over a network's function by allowing a network administrator to segregate out pieces of their address space for specific needs.",

When light\\nencounters particles much smaller than its wavelength, the scattered\\nintensity is inversely proportional to the 4'th power of the\\nwavelength.  This is called \"Rayleigh scattering,\" and it means that\\nhalf the wavelength is scattered with 2**4 = 16 times more intensity.\\nThat's why the sky appears blue: the blue light is scattered some 16\\ntimes more strongly than the red light.  Rayleigh scattering is also\\nthe reason why the setting Sun appears red: the blue light has been\\nscattered away from the direct sunlight.\\n \\nThus, if the atmosphere of another planet is composed of a transparent\\ngas or gases whose molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of\\nlight, we would, in general, also expect the sky on that planet to\\nhave a blue color.\\n \\nIf you want another color of the sky, you need bigger particles in the\\nair.  You need something bigger than molecules in the air---dust.\\n \\nDust particles can be many times larger than air molecules but still\\nsmall enough to not fall out to the ground.  If the dust particles are\\nmuch larger than the wavelength of light, the scattered light will be\\nneutral in color (i.e., white or gray)---this also happens in clouds\\nhere on Earth, which consist of water droplets.  If the dust particles\\nare of approximately the same size as the wavelength of light, the\\nsituation gets complex, and all sorts of interesting scattering\\nphenomena may happen.  This happens here on Earth from time to time,\\nparticularly in desert areas, where the sky may appear white, brown,\\nor some other color.  Dust is also responsible for the pinkish sky on\\nMars, as seen in the photographs returned from the Viking landers.\\n \\nIf the atmosphere contains lots of dust, the direct light from the Sun\\nor Moon may occasionally get some quite unusual color.  Sometimes,\\ngreen and blue moons have been reported.  These phenomena are quite\\nrare though---they happen only \"once in a blue moon....\"  :) The dust\\nresponsible for these unusual color phenomena is most often volcanic\\nin origin.  When El Chicon erupted in 1982, this caused unusually\\nstrongly colored sunsets in equatorial areas for more than one year.\\nThe much bigger volcanic explosion at Krakatoa, some 110 years ago,\\ncaused green and blue moons worldwide for a few years.\\n \\nOne possible exception to the above discussion is if the clouds on the\\nplanet are composed of a strongly colored chemical.  This might occur\\non Jupiter, where the clouds are thought to contain sulfur, phosphorus,\\nand/or various organic chemicals.\\n \\nIt's also worth pointing out that the light of the planet's primary is\\nquite insignificant.  Our eyes are highly adaptable to the dominating\\nillumination and perceive it as \"white,\" within a quite wide range of\\npossible colors.  During daytime, we perceive the light from the Sun\\n(6000 K) as white, and at night we perceive the light from our\\nincandescent lamps (2800 K, like a late, cool M star) as white.  Only\\nif we put these two lights side-by-side, at comparable intensities,\\nwill we perceive a clear color difference.\\n \\nIf the Sun was a hot star (say of spectral type B), it's likely we\\nstill would perceive its light as \"white\" and the sky's color as blue.",

Consider the following:\\n\\nA great promise of telemedicine has been to help isolated or scattered populations gain access to health services. In industrialized countries, telemedicine has proven to be a good tool for enabling access to knowledge and allowing information exchange, and showing that it is possible to bring good quality healthcare to isolated communities.\\n\\nTelemedicine is beginning to have an important impact on many aspects of health care in developing countries. When implemented well, telemedicine may allow developing countries to leapfrog over their developed neighbours in successful health care\\ndelivery. Places such as Pakistan may find that local practitioners can provide the best advice to their patients without having to send them from small communities to large urban centres. Outposts in the highlands of Papau New Guinea may replace their radio communications from the 1970s with internet communication at little extra cost. Trainees from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States may find excellent opportunities to gain experience in Bangladesh, Guatemala, or Nepal, while continuing to pursue their learning objectives in concert with mentors from their home institutions.\\n\\nThese trainees will develop collaborations with local students, which could last a lifetime, opening the way for more equitable distribution of knowledge and medical care throughout the world. Medicine rests on solid principles which can transcend political and social divisions. Telemedicine should allow us to implement advances in the spirit of our historical roots, even at a distance. \\n\\nMost telemedicine projects call upon a mix of delivery paths. High-precision remote surgical interventions, for example, or remote access to very complex imagery such as brain scans, dictate the use of high-speed broadband telecommunication links. However, in many cases, the public Internet offers huge possibilities. It provides fast access to medical data, patient symptoms and expertise nationally, regionally or globally, thus bringing medical care to those who would otherwise go unattended. The improved quality of videoconference and audio tools on the Internet is also providing a valuable resource for live, remote consultation and diagnosis.\\n\\nThe continuing decline in the cost of telecommunications and information technology, as well as great leaps in digital imaging and compression techniques have spurred a new wave of enthusiasm for telemedicine, particularly in developing countries. It is in these countries where telemedicine’s greatest asset — allowing specialist medical expertise to be delivered to regions and locations where doctors are few on the ground — shows the best prospects for success.\\n\\nFor governments struggling with limited health care budgets, a shortage of doctors and other health care professionals, dispersed rural hospitals and poor transportation infrastructure, telemedicine may help them overcome these difficult challenges in meeting the health care needs of their citizens.",

In addition, the Federal Reserve operates certain key payment mechanisms and oversees the operation of the payment system more generally, with the goal of strengthening and stabilizing the system.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve engages in all these activities on a routine basis, but the stabilization activities of a central bank are especially evident and critical during periods of financial stress, such as those that occurred following the stock market decline of October 1987, the international debt crisis in the fall of 1998, and the terrorist attacks in September 2001. In these instances, the Federal Reserve promoted financial system stability by providing ample liquidity (balances at the Federal Reserve) through large open market purchases of securities (using short-term repurchase agreements) and by extending discount window loans to depository institutions.
