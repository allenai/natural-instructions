Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for \"fit\" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.).

This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \"Self Reliance,\" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the \"independence of solitude\"). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a \"finished man\" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced \"perfect sweetness\" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \\nWhat do you think?",

It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \\nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.  Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994).",

There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory.",

There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics.",

Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \\n\\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \\n\\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\\n\\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\\n\\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \\n\\n\\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \\n\\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\\n\\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all.\" \\n\\n",

During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \\nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out” to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. \\nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.",

There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.

Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn \"incentivizes\" people to answer questions.

However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\\n\\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\\n\\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\\n\\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now \"secure enough\" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or \"encrypt\" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\\n\\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!",

I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region.  Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program.\\n\\nI agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it.  Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student.  I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student.  It opens a lot of doors.  But you need to be very goal directed to get this value.\\n\\nI can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good.  As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now.  Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks.\\n\\nSo - to your actual question.  If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously).  Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program.

As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead.

It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average, and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example.

Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\\n\\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\\n\\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.  The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming.  Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.\\n\\nIt's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself.  Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\\n\\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\\n\\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\\n\\nwhere N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year.  \\n\\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\\n\\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\\n\\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year.",

I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him.  \\n\\nOnline dating is just another way to meet people, but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people.  If you're banking on it working, it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience.  It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead, decide to just have fun with the experience, regardless of the outcome.  Yes, even a bad date can be fun.  Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends.\\n\\nI find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work.

When I rewrote it this time, I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me.

I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. \\n\\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\\n\\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\\n\\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\\n\\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\\n\\n4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\\n\\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\\n\\nhope this helps?",

That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles.

The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.

A period of legal separation constitutes grounds for divorce; the length of that period varies from state to state.    Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple may reconcile, in which case they need do nothing in order to remain married.

If so, then this is what's called a \"disqualifying disposition\".  In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price).  \\n\\nIn general, the IRS wants you to pay tax in the quarter in which the related income is earned.  So you theoretically should pay the estimated tax at your standard income tax rate in the same quarter you exercise and sell ISOs.  You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return.     The following information is sourced from See http://www.fool.com/school/taxes/taxes35.htm. \\n\\n1.  The simplest way is just to suck it up and not worry about paying a penalty for underpayment of taxes.  Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000).  Be wary though that you probably can't keep doing this year after year without the IRS getting on your case. \\n\\n2.  Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\\n\\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\\n\\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\\n\\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill.  This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\\n\\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000.   If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\\n\\n\\n\\nClear?  As mud?\\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\\n\\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%).  \\n\\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.  However, that's a topic for a whole 'nother question/answer.   \\n\\n\\n* Even with NQSOs, if the amount held at source is less than your eventual tax rate for the year,  you may be subject to tax penalties unless you meet one of the exceptions listed in a) through d) above.",

The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.  The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\\n\\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.  The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\\n\\nA couple things to consider, though.  In order to switch to a double compact, you need to replace a fair number of components, including the bottom bracket, cranks, rear derailleur (optional but highly recommended), front derailleur and possibly your left shifter.

This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. \\n\\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. The set price is called the strike price. When you (the stock option holder) make use of your right to buy/sell stock according to the terms of the option, you are exercising the option. Call options are options giving you the right to buy stock. Put options are options giving you the right to sell stock. Employers grant call options to employees. Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. Let's say it's after four years now. Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\\n\\nStock grants are simpler to understand. The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. So let's use the Google example again. Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\\n\\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. This is done to give employees an incentive to stay at the company.",

Alpha Test was the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.

I'll tell you why in a little bit.\\n\\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles.  Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\\n\\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \\n\\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \\n\\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\\n\\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\\n\\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?",

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\\n\\nPopulation\\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\\n\\n\\nName\\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word \"Chelokee\" meaning \"people of a different speech.\" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) \"principal people\" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) \"people of Kituhwa.\" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\\n\\n\\nSub-tribes\\n\\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \\nLower",

A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight.",

This is not without controversy. Among the most vocal opponents are those in the deaf community, who feel that their culture and language are at stake (Cohen, 1994) and the Learning Disabilities Association of America, which believes that mandatory full inclusion policies violate federal law (\"Full inclusion,\" undated).",

And they're all great and wonderful individuals who don't seem to lack anything. I have had at times to explain certain things about the Christian religion to them, which is the dominant religion in the western world, and its practice can raise questions to the uninitiated.\\n\\nIf you seek spirituality, you should not limit your self to exploring one religion. Why do you dismiss Buddhism, Taoism etc? You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\\n\\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. Learn, and let it be your choice. If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\\n\\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\\n\\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). You can learn more on different religions by following the links below.\\n\\nI know in China most Christians are unitarian, since in 1949 the Government forced denominations to form one single church or leave China.\\n\\nRemember learn before you act, and don't let anyone influence you. My opinion is that once you decide on something you should stick by it. Should you make the conscious choice to have Faith in a religion. So being absolutely certain is essential. Changing religions in the manner you'd change shirts is not ideal. Because then Faith - which is the most important element in every religion - never gets too strong to mean anything in your life.\\n\\nWhatever choice you make - good luck to you!",

Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\\n\\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal. I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\\n\\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful.

The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\\n\\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs.

Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\\n2. Collect proof of misdeeds for each particular P2P service that is allowing illegal file copying.\\n3. Sue the P2P service and demand they hand over IP addresses of offending users.\\n4. Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\\n\\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\\n\\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\\n\\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\\n\\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\\n\\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\\n\\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\\n\\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school.  It makes them get a higher grade than they deserve and if the test is graded on a curve, your A- work can wind up being counted as a B+.  \\n\\nWell, songwriters composed that music and/or lyrics, musicians practiced and learned to play that song and paid to use a recording studio to perform it in.  When people don't pay to hear that play, the musicians still have their expenses to pay but no royalty check to pay for it.

Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a \"feed\").\\n\\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication \"universe\" right away. Free readers are available as well; a search for \"RSS Reader\" at popular search sites will yield many results.\\n\\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). Also, any upgrades or new features are added automatically. The trade-off comes in different (some would say fewer) features and slightly slower performance versus desktop systems.

Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide?

The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\\n\\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\\n\\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\\n\\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\\n\\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\\n\\n\\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX",

Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. Their work has yet to be completed. The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\\n\\n\\nStandards\\n\\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. This would ensure compatibility.\\n\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\\n\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. The setup would most likely begin with a router. This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. These allow any wired device to be included on the network. The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\\n\\n\\nAdvantages/Conclusions\\n\\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. Only then should 802.11n be considered.",

Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\\n\\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. It is contained in our mitochandria. Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key \"markers\" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\\n\\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. Let me give you an example. Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. Others will not be so lucky. If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are.",

His main occupations and services rendered were in Royal Prussia, as church canon, governor and administrator, economist, jurist, physician, astrologer and military leader (conducting defense against the Teutonic Order). Amid all his responsibilities, he treated astronomy as a hobby. His theory about the Sun as the center of the Universe, opposed to the traditional geocentric theory that placed Earth at the center, is considered one of the most important discoveries ever, and is the fundamental starting point of modern astronomy and modern science itself (it inaugurated a scientific revolution). His theory affected many aspects of human life, opening the door for young astronomers, scientists and scholars to take a skeptical attitude toward established dogma.\"",

Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\\n\\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\\n\\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. Without it, they would just be average.\\n\\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\\n\\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\\n\\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out.

I've lost right at 150 lbs. & I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :)\\n\\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity...don't know why. Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\\n\\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of \"bad nasties\". I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store...Victoria's Secret, to be exact. My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. But it just hit me oddly. I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\\n\\nThat's what did it...that's what started the whole process. By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. So, here's how I handled it...\\n\\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want...I'm not kidding. True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating but I also don't beat myself up about it. If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. The big problem for me was breads.\\n\\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\\n\\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes where you can.\\n\\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages...OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! But you know what? I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! That's motivation, I can promise you...\\n\\nMy suggestion after all",

It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after World War I. Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\\n\\n\\nOttoman Empire (ŏt'əmən) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\\nOrganization of the Empire\\n\\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\\n\\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\\n\\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\\n\\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\\n\\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. In Constantinople the Greeks and Armenians held a privileged status and were very influential in commerce and politics. The despotic system of government was mitigated only by the observance of Muslim law.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. The Ottomans, however, soon rallied.\\n\\nThe Period of Great Expansion\\n\\nThe empire, reunited by Muhammad I, expanded victoriously under Muhammad's successors Murad II and Muhammad II.

Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online. \\n\\nAnyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \\n\\nYou do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.\\n\\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \\n\\nHope this helps!\\nGoodluck,\\nDave",

Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.  Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice.  Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called \"faith\" and the controlling of culture through that so-called \"faith\"...thereby falling into suspicion of \"satanic\" influences.  It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\\n\\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.  Furthermore, any member of a masonic society will claim no knowledge of satanic connections to their brotherhood.

Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\\n\\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.  That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells).",

At the genetic level, cystic fibrosis is most often the result of an in-frame deletion of three base pairs in the DNA. Cystic fibrosis results from the production of an abnormal form of a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR functions in transporting chloride ions across epithelial cells found in the lung and intestinal tract. In CF patients, CFTR does not function properly, causing accumulation of ions inside epithelial cells. Since water follows ions by osmosis, this results in water depletion and viscous mucus on the surface of alveoli. The most common CFTR protein abnormality is a mutation termed ΔF508, which is characterized by the deletion of the DNA basepair sequence at chromosome location 7q31.1 that codes for a single amino acid, phenylalanine.",

I will try to explain them in as much non-tech terms as possible.\\n \\nSerialization:\\n Serialization is a process of saving state of an object in some format. State of an object means its current value which in turn comprises of the values of the members of the object. For example, if I have a class Student, having RollNo and Name as its members(properties), and an object of Student class 'Deobrat' is created with ROllNo=01 and Name=\"Deobrat Singh\". Then serialization of the object Deobrat would mean, saving this object somewhere (either in memorystream or in a filestream or on a networkstream) in such a way that it can later be reconstructed to again form the same object.\\nTo be a bit more elaborate, consider an example where I have to send an object across a network to some remote computer (something that we do in WebServices). Now, in this case, the object itself cannot be sent because the network doesn't recognise what an object is. It simply understands a stream of bytes and nothing else. Serialization allows us to convert this object into a stream of bytes which then could be sent across the network to the remote computer.\\n \\nDeserialization:\\n Deserialization is exactly the reverse process of Serialization. It means, to convert the stream of bytes in order to reconstruct the original object (or object state to be more precise). In the Web Service example scenario taken above, the Service Request broker will simply extract the stream of bytes, Deserialize them to create the object and give it to the class that is supposed to process it.\\n \\nExternalization:\\n Serialization is achieved in 2 ways.\\nUsing the Serializable interface which tells the runtime(or JVM) that the class has only premitive types that are serializable by themselves so the runtime can go ahead and use it's own code to serialize any object of this class. \\nOn the other hand, if you want to write a class that has complete control over the process of serialization & deserialization, you implement Externalizable interface. In this case, when an object of your class has to be serialized, the runtime will not do it by itself. Rather it will call a method writeExternal to serialize the object. You will have complete control over the stream and format of the data to serialize. While deserializing the object, again the runtime will call readExternal method on your class which is supposed to read the stream and reconstruct the object state.\\nA word of caution:\\n\\n In most cases, it is sufficient to use the Serializable interface because you wont have to write code for the serialization process. But in certain cases where you have a very heavy class with a lot of properties which need not be sent to the other end, it is better to write your code using Externalizable interface, because, then you will have complete control over which properties need to be serialized and which need not be serialized. While deserializing, again, your class will know which are the properties that must have been serialized and accordingly, you can recreate the object state.\\n\\nIn general, if you want a custom (in most cases, partial) serialization/deserialization to happen, you use Externalization.",

Most states now have a law on the books that requires all of the credit reporting agencies to give you a credit report once a year. Check it over. Make sure that there are no *mistakes* on it - late payments that were not late, disputed accounts, etc. \\n\\nLate payments and charged-off accounts stay on for 7 years, bankruptcies for 10. Generally, lenders are looking for patterns of behavior rather than once-in-a-way problems. If you find something wrong (and it's likely, unfortunately), write a letter to the credit bureau, providing documentation that you're right. They have to respond in 30 days; if the creditor can't prove that the negative item is indeed true, it comes off your report.\\n\\nNow you're down to real debt. If you can't afford the payments, contact the lenders and negotiate reduced payments. They will prefer to be getting something rather than having to write off the debt. Once you can afford to pay everything, commit to paying off the worst (i.e., highest-interest) items first. They cost you the most money that isn't going toward paying off the debt. Once you've killed one, the money you were spending on that one can be applied to the next-worst debt, and so on. The amount you can pay any given creditor snowballs rapidly when you follow this pattern. You have to remember, though, that when the first one is paid off, you don't have \"more money\". You still need to be committing that to killing your debt.\\n\\nIf you're out of debt, but your credit is lousy, get a secured card, use it, and pay it off every month. This will do a lot for your credit rating. In addition, open a savings account, and make regular deposits. This shows you are saving money and have a resource to pay your bills.",

Why should you believe in somehting of which there is no proof?  \\n\\nIn my personal opinion, there are only three reasons people become religious:\\n\\n1)  They are fearful.  Fearful of death, fearful of not knowing the purpose of their existence, fearful of losing everything that they value in this life (which you will, gauranteed).  Fear is a powerful motivator and when someone offers you a way to manage that fear through a belief system it can be tempting to accept.  There is no need to resort to philosophy, science or psyhcology.  There is no need to accept that there are rational and scientific explanations that we as humans simply don't know yet.   Just believe that someone's making it all right in the end and you're all set.\\n\\n2) They are seeking a path to redemption for past sins.  They are having difficulty coping with the consequences of some bad action they have taken in thier life, and or are trying to control some compulsive behavior that has caused hardship in their life.  Either they were in prison, got caught with a prostitue, or drank themselves out of job and their family, or simply told a horrible lie that they feel guilty about.  Religion offers instant redemption and rituals to help you ease your mind through repentance.  \\n\\n3)  They have a strong natural desire for community and companionship.  Having someplace to go every Sunday with likeminded people or having rituals to follow when someone dies, or having a language or framework to use when communicating your values with others can be very comforting.  If your family already subscribes to these beliefs you even may feel pressure to accept things that your logical mind tells you are impossible and&#92;or unlikely.\\n\\nYou can deal with these three situations through patience, meditation, compassion, seeking help from others, and community activism, or you can choose to believe in supernatural beings and mythology.  My personal opinion is that there is no easy way out of any problem so that when a christian says I can instantly have my sins forgiven or a Scientologist tells me that body thetans are causing my suffering, or some guru tells me that my Shakras just need alignments, I usually take a pass.",

There is simply too little energy coming from the sun to account for our planet's temperature. The controversial point is when global warming is applied to the current rise in average global temperature that has taken place over the past 50 so years.

In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\\n\\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\\n\\nHow is vasectomy done?\\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\\n\\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \\n\\nPage 2 of this Article \\nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\\nThe Doctor's Response\\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below −300°F (−185°F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period. However, there is considerable debate over the scientif",

Its alot of pulling and tugging to make a profit on Ebay.  But, products come and go all the time.  When fads hit, it also hits Ebay.  When the fads are gone, those numbers also dwindle on Ebay.  The other half is your ability to sell the product.  I have seen so many people sell the product the wrong way, that even if it was priced low enough, nobody would bid.  So, you have to figure out what drives customers to bid, regardless of the product.  Your best bet is creating a product and selling it on Ebay.  I have heard people selling things on Ebay that they made.  I heard someone making 200 a day selling hand made cloaks.  But, thats them, you have to find your own market.  Um, last part about ebay is reselling a product.  If you see something cheap enough to make a profit off of, then by all means buy it.  See, if you buy something for $100 and sell it for $105, you only made $5 buxx.  And after Ebay fees, you make \"jack.\"  But, if you can find a product for $12 dollars and sell it for $25, then you make a better profit.  Now its all up to you to sell as much as you can.  See?  So, small stuff can be worthwhile some times.  I used to do okay selling 99 cent coins.  Not bad for free stuff.  I would sell about 100 of them a week.  Thats not bad for 3 hours worth of work.  But, its not enough to live off of, so I sell other things as well.

In fact, during winter, the earth is physically closer to the sun and during the summer, it is furthest.\\n\\nTilt is key. Its important that not only is there a tilt on the earth, but the direction of that tilt is not altered during the rotation of the earth around the sun.\\n\\nThe Northern hemisphere is always tilting away during the winter, and towards the sun during the summer. The tilt of the earth is 23 degrees. So lets say you're at 45 degrees lattitude. During the summer, the sun will rise to 45+23 (68) degrees because the tilt is towards it, and in winter, the sun only goes to 45-23 (22) degrees. There is a big difference between the sun going up 22 degrees and the sun going to 68 degrees.\\n\\nWhen the sun goes to 68 degrees, it is more overhead, and the earth therefore receives more of its rays. During winter, light rays are striking obliquely, and hence do not warm the earth as much.\\n\\nThis is why there are less variations of seasons around the equator, where the sun is almost always directly overhead all the time.\\n\\nAnd this is why seasons are reversed on the southern hemisphere. When the northern hemisphere tilts towards the sun, the south is tilting away.",

Simply put, the Sun is up longer in the sky (rises earlier and sets later) in summer. Clocks and common mechanical timepieces keep what's called civil time, which roughly corresponds to the passage of a fictitious \"average\" Sun through our sky. This is necessary since the Sun does not rise and set on a regular basis, but changes by as much as 15 minutes throughout the course of the year.\\n\\nDaylight Saving Time was generally adopted by countries around World War I, but President Wilson repealed the United States' mandatory daylight savings law on March 31, 1918. During World War II, Daylight Savings Time was reestablished by law on a year-round basis, and later seen as a fuel saving measure during the Arab Oil Embargo crisis of 1973-74. In late 1974, standard time was brought back. During World War II, the U.S. and some other countries implemented \"double\" daylight savings time consisting of a two hour shift.",

He gambled on the possibility that we would forget what he did, become desensitized to it, and dismiss the jury's decision overly harsh.

But when in love, we often miss the red flags, so if that happens, here are what I consider serious and justifiable grounds:\\n\\nAdultery -- many people can't move past this.  It's a physical betrayal, but also tears at you emotionally.  I personally think it's one of the most difficult ones to resolve.\\n\\nAbuse -- physical or verbal.  Verbal often gets overlooked, but it's namecalling, screaming at you rather than holding a normal conversation, talked down to, and did I mention yelling and screaming?  If you ask the person a normal question, like \"do you have any change for the toll?\" and they start screaming that \"all you do is harp about money,\" you've got a problem.  Physical is obvious, but don't overlook punching walls, breaking dishes, etc.  Watch out for signs of roughness or  meanness to your children and pets too.\\n\\nControl Freaks:  This is also a form of abuse, but these men want to know your every move, monitor your phone calls, read your email and voice mails, won't let you go to the mall alone, etc.  Insist that if you get a new hairdo or buy a new dress, it must be because you're cheating with someone.  This is usually disguised as jealousy which women may think lattering -- at first.  Don't be fooled.  Control freaks also don't want you to hold a job or have any money of your own.  You must beg for an \"allowance.\"\\n\\nFinancial:  There are a lot of men who live off women.  They have jobs when you meet them.  Then, something happens, and it's always the company or bosses fault.  They tell you they're out job hunting, but nothing is happening.  Next comes laying around on the couch all day, sleeping, watching tv or guzzling beer.  Weeks turn into months and it's just you working.  Or, the person flits from job to job and can't hold a job.  This man will plunge you right into financial ruin and guess what -- you can't get them out of the house all that easy, if it happens to be your house and not a joint home.  Keep an eye out that they don't dip into your wallet.  A dollar or two missing, here and there, usually becomes much more.  You'll get behind on bills, your credit will suffer.  Don't stand for this.\\n\\nAddictive behavior:  Drugs, alchoholism, gambling.  Will cause you nothing but stress, pain and financial hardship.  Don't try to be the hero and \"help\" the person out of despair.  Unless you are rich enough to get them into very good rehab, like the movie stars do, it probably won't work.  Addicts can only be helped if they want to be and you'll be surprised how many enjoy the behavior and have no desire to give it up.  I've seen men go to AA or a counseling session, come right out and stop at a bar.  It is almost a joke with them.  You may keep gamblers out of casinos, but they'll spend a whole paycheck on lottery tickets or the football pool.\\n\\nIllegal behavior:  Selling drugs, stealing, pulls insurance scams, (or any scams), etc., RUN.  He'll eventually get caught and you might get implicated too!  Do you want his record to become yours?\\n\\nGood luck.",

It was made into an Academy Award-winning motion picture starring Gregory Peck by director Robert Mulligan in 1962. A coming-of-age story, it is told from the point of view of Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch, the young daughter of Atticus Finch, an educated lawyer in Maycomb, Alabama, a small town in the deep South of the United States. She is accompanied by her brother Jem and their mutual friend Dill.\\n\\nTruman Capote was a lifelong friend of childhood neighbor Lee, and allegedly was the inspiration for Dill's character in her best-seller. Capote frequently implied that he himself had written a considerable portion of her novel, and some have said he ghosted the entire novel. At least one person—Pearl Kazin Bell, an editor at Harper's— has gone on record as believing his assertions were true.\\n\\nThe title of the book is taken from Atticus's advice to his children about firing their air rifles at birds: \"Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\". The blue jay is a very common bird, and is often perceived as a bully and a pest, whereas mockingbirds do nothing but \"sing their hearts out for us\". Metaphorically, several of the book's characters can be seen as \"mockingbirds\", attacked despite doing nothing but good. The mockingbird represents innocence, and to kill one is to metaphorically kill innocence. Note that the protagonists are also named after birds: Tom Robinson and the Finch family. However, \"Finch\" was also Lee's mother's maiden name.\\n\\nHarper Lee stated, \"To get the ideas for the book I used recent events in my time like the Scottsboro Trials.\" (Harper Lee, Book Review, 1964)\\n\\nThe events of this book's publication and the following film are also subjects of the 2005 film Capote starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee.

Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. \\n\\n    But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

Next, turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home.  Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table, and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom--or whereever you're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred.

Nutrients, wastes, and hormones are exchanged across the thin walls of capillaries. Capillaries are microscopic in size, although blushing is one manifestation of blood flow into capillaries. Control of blood flow into capillary beds is done by nerve-controlled sphincters. \\n\\n\\nChanges in blood pressure, velocity, and the area of the arteries, capillaries, and veins of the circulatory system.

I've been programming for 15 years and had been seriously hoping to make my own language one of these days, because all the languages I was used to had severe limitations at every turn.  I don't know how to explain all the reasons why I hate conventional languages, but let it suffice to say that Ruby lets you do virtually anything you want to do; it supports a wide variety of programming styles, and can do many things that are difficult or impossible in other languages, such as metaprogramming (the possibilities with this seem endless), arbitrarily changing existing classes (including built-in classes), coroutines (although you'll have to implement them yourself, since Ruby only has continuations built in), lightweight (non-OS) threads, closures, multiple inheritance (well, not exactly, but Ruby's \"mixins\" are just as good), \"freezing\" objects, and on and on.\\n\\nAlso, after reading through the online book Programming Ruby, I got the feeling that the designer and developer (\"Matz\") really knew what he was doing.  The parts of the language fit together well and on the whole, the language is well rounded, with a feature for everyone.\\n\\nFinally, Ruby is easy to play with, because\\n(1) you don't have do define a class and a method and write a ton of import/include/using statements (as in Java/C#/C++) -- code at the top level automatically runs (in a hidden method called \"main\", I think.)\\n(2) you get the interactive interpreter called IRB, with which you can type statements and get immediate results.  Multi-line statements (such as method and class definitions) are also allowed.\\n\\nThe one big problem with Ruby is that it is dynamically typed and interpreted, and thus very slow, although I've heard it is not much slower than Python or Perl.\\n\\nMy second favorite language is C# 2.0, which has most of the features I would want in a statically-typed language.  (although there's certainly enough missing that I still wish I had time to develop my own language.)",

Independent variables, such as climate, uplift, base level, erodibility of surficial materials, and impact of man, are changing at rates that are sufficiently rapid as to preclude attainment of steady state, particularly for those landforms that require geologic time spans to approach steady-state configurations.

Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but can differ in the number of neutrons, in which case they are called isotopes of that element. Atoms are electrostatically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus are less tightly bound to the atom and are relatively easily transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Particles in the nucleus also sometimes escape atoms, in a process known as radioactive decay.\\n\\nAtoms are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry, and are conserved in chemical reactions.

Daylight savings is a human invention, not a natural phenomenon.\\n\\n...because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth's rotation slowing down.\\n\\nThe amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.\\n\\nEven that is an approximation, the decimal digits can keep going on.\\n\\nSo initially, the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days. But about every 4 years, you'd be off 1 day. A century later, you've drifted off by a whole month!\\n\\nSo, leap years came into effect. Febuary has another day every 4 years. \\n\\nBut now you've approximated a year to 365.25 days, when in reality, its 365.2425 days.\\n\\nEvery century, you'll be off 1 day.\\n\\nSo that's where the next rule comes into play: \"If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, its a leap year.\"\\n\\nNow we've approximated it to 365.2425, but because its always going to be an approximation, our calendar days are always slipping. All because the earth doesn't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.\\n\\nThis is why leap seconds are added, and not to account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation.\\n\\nAs to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours, I'm not sure. But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes, or we'd notice that soon enough, its dark at noon! :)  Time was divided a long time ago, and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it, so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with. The lost time, if its accounted for by leap years and such, could be easier to manage.\\n\\nFirst, I never said the earth is not slowing down. I said its not why leap seconds exist. And ok, I can entertain my explanation may be wrong, but that's no reason for your condescending tone, Jolly Roger. But look, your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site, where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect? \\n\\nYou haven't bothered to explain his original question. If leapseconds account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation, why are there leap seconds and not leap milliseconds?\\n\\nIf you want to append to your answer, at least try to do so while respecting the other users on this site, and not insult their intelligence.\\n\\nThis has piqued my curiosity, if there's anyone out there that has a source that says my explanation is incorrect, I mean an actual science website, you know, one that steers clear of religion, please let me know.",

Here are some tips for getting started:\\n\\n    * Study in chunks: 20-50 minute time periods followed by a brief break (5-10 minutes) is the most effective way to study\\n    * Use daylight hours: an hour of studying during the day is worth two at night! Do the work that requires the most concentration (typically reading) earliest in the day.\\n    * Rank your three classes and be sure to spend time on your most challenging class everyday and early in the day.\\n    * Study actively: ask yourself questions, review your notes regularly, discuss key concepts with peers and course professor \\n\\nWhere to Study:\\n\\nAlthough studying in a dorm room is convenient, it is often a poor place to learn. The dorm has a plethora of distractions including Blitzmail, Snood, the telephone, video games, friends down the hall.

This is accomplished by showing close ties to your home country.\\n\\nYou should present evidence of the following things at your visa interview:\\n1)  A letter from your employer indicating that you have a good job and are expected to return to your job after you return.\\n2)  A copy of your bank statements showing that you have sufficient money to fund your trip.\\n3)  A copy of your lease/mortgage showing that you have a home in Georgia that you can not leave.\\n4)  Proof of a car.\\n5)  Photos of you travelling in other developed countries.  For example, if you went to London on vacation and came back, you are more likely to return to Georgia after visiting New York.\\n6)   A good reason to visit America.  I would say that you want to go to Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  Don't say: I want to stay at my cousin's house for three months.\\n7) Luck.  Honestly, if your cousin lives in Chicago and the visa officer is from Chicago, you will have better luck.  I once went to a lecture by a visa officer.  He said that he once approved somebody because an applicant was planning on studying in America, but wanted to look at colleges first.  One of the five colleges listed, was the speakers small liberal arts college.  Because of that, the visa was granted.",

Roosevelt and Bonaparte both were \"Progressives.\" They shared the conviction that efficiency and expertise, not political connections, should determine who could best serve in government. Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States in 1901; four years later, he appointed Bonaparte to be Attorney General. In 1908, Bonaparte applied that Progressive philosophy to the Department of Justice by creating a corps of Special Agents. It had neither a name nor an officially designated leader other than the Attorney General. Yet, these former detectives and Secret Service men were the forerunners of the FBI.\\n\\nBy 1907, the Department of Justice most frequently called upon Secret Service \"operatives\" to conduct investigations. These men were well-trained, dedicated -- and expensive. Moreover, they reported not to the Attorney General, but to the Chief of the Secret Service. This situation frustrated Bonaparte, who wanted complete control of investigations under his jurisdiction. Congress provided the impetus for Bonaparte to acquire his own force. On May 27, 1908, it enacted a law preventing the Department of Justice from engaging Secret Service operatives.\\n\\nThe following month, Attorney General Bonaparte appointed a force of Special Agents within the Department of Justice. Accordingly, ten former Secret Service employees and a number of Department of Justice peonage (i.e., compulsory servitude) investigators became Special Agents of the Department of Justice. On July 26, 1908, Bonaparte ordered them to report to Chief Examiner Stanley W. Finch. This action is celebrated as the beginning of the FBI.",

It starts off with this guy who removes rivets (screws) from an airplane wing so that he could sell them for profit. Each rivet/screw represents a unique species that plays an important role in our ecosystem. The loss of each one has an adverse effect on the whole structure. It is true that such effects may or may not have an immediate recognizable effect on us but that does not mean that it is not happening. Also, we humans, have proven that we are really self centered that we do not recognize the damage that we are doing unless it hits us in the face. There are countless examples of chain reactions in the ecosystem due to a loss of an integral species. For example, (although I am no longer certain about the details) due to the misuse of a pesticide by farmers in rural Peru, an outbreak of more resistant  pests evolved. The farmers in reaction started to use more pesticides which affected the other species that naturally feed on and control these pests. The situation got so bad that it escalated to such an extent that cats which controlled the rat population died out because they got the higher dose of the poisonous pesticide in their system. Finally, (believe it or not) they had to fly cats to the area and dropped them from helicopters...thus it did rain cats that day in Peru.",

Let him get comfortable with you.\\n\\nA guy will usually like a girl who laughs at his jokes. It shows she is atuned to him. Kind of thinks the same way he does.  It kind of validates his attitude or way of thinking.  It is kind of like you saying to him, \"that is very smart\" without coming right out and saying it.  Of course, only if he said something funny!\\n\\nAsk him for his opinion, once in a while.  Things like \"what do YOU think?\" or \"which one do YOU prefer?\" are good questions.  They are easy for him to answer if you are asking about something that is in the front of his mind at the moment.\\n\\nQuestions like \"what are you THINKING?\" are almost always hard for guys to answer, on the other hand.  They may not be thinking much of anything, but if they say that, they sound kind of stupid.  Or they might be thinking about something boring. If they tell you what it is, you will think they are boring. \\n\\nTry not to put them on the spot like that, at least not until you are at the flirting stage. At that point, you can sort of hint what they should be thinking.  In other words, a question can be a little bit like taking a test.  If you are going to give them one, make sure it is an easy one.\\n\\nDress nice, of course.  But do not worry about if your clothes or accessories are really expensive.  Know why?\\n\\nGuys have no idea how much girls' clothes cost. They might not even know how much their own clothes cost.\\n\\nLots of boys when they are taken clothing shopping just want to get in and get out of that store.\\n\\nThey might really care about a jacket, true. Shoes, possibly - like if they are into sports and need a good shoe for their sport or running. But pants, socks, belts, shirts - probably just wearing them because they have to.  Jackets and coats are a little different.\\n\\nIf you want to catch a guy's eye, do some color-coordindation.  For example, if you have a sweater or shirt with some lavendar in it, wearing earings or a hair clip that is exactly the same color will look really neat.  He will think you are a sharp dresser.\\n\\nThe same thing goes for your eyes.  If you wear a shirt that has some of the same color as your eyes, that might catch his eyes.  Up to ten percent of all guys are slightly color blind though. Details vary, but some guys cannot even tell red from green.  So if doing that color matching thing does not work, do not take it too hard.  Or, try matching two things of a different color than the first one you tried.\\n\\nI guess if varies from guy to guy but usually a nice hairstyle catches my eye.  If your hair looks nice, he might notice that.\\n\\nLooking straight into his eyes when you are talking to him.  That might get you noticed more too.\\n\\nBeing fit, in good shape helps.  You don't have to be super skinny or super strong.  You don't really have to be super anything.  Just be healthy.\\n\\nAlso, if you are happy and smile a lot, guys like that.  Talking with other guys or girls is good too.  It shows you are social, you make friends easily, and you have friends.  That makes you more interesting, probably.\\n\\nIf you go overboard trying to do something to make him like you, it could backfire a little.  If you laugh at his jokes when you really don't think they are funny at all, he might sense from your tone or your expression that you are being kind of phony.\\n\\nSometimes you can be a little sarcastic, kind of dig at him a little with a comment, just to get his attention.  But don't start putting him down or calling him stupid or weak.  That will just get him mad or hurt.  And, even if it doesn't, it will put his friends off toward you. They could start to feel like they need to protect him from you, maybe suggest he find a different girlfriend.\\n\\nYou could also get him a gift.  It does not have to be something expe",

A breathing excercise helps, I use the \"breath in to count of three, hold for four, breath out for 5\" routine.  Get as relaxed as possible and concentrate on raising yourself up out of your body.  If you can concentrate easily it takes less tries of course, but you will actually feel it happen.  Whether that's a dream or not I don't know.  When you get to that point pick a place in the house to go to and concentrate on going there.  It's really simple, and doesn't take a great deal of effort.  This is the stage I was able to achieve, around 1986, when I stopped and never did it again.  Nothing really scary, I guess it just convinced me enough and I left it at that.\\n\\nGood luck.",

Although other browsers have introduced these features, Firefox became the first such browser to achieve wide adoption.\\n\\nFirefox has attracted attention as an alternative to other browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. As of November 2005, estimates suggest that Firefox's usage share is around 9.4% of overall browser usage (See market adoption), with its highest usage in Finland (about 30%).

Training might start by specifying steps needed to accomplish a particular task, but more than this is needed to assure that certain skills or procedures are learned. Participants in a training course should practice the desired behavior and receive pertinent feedback to support what's right and correct what's wrong. If feedback is given genuinely in a trusting and caring atmosphere, behavior might not only be directly improved, but one's thinking or attitude associated with the behavior might be positive. \\n\\nConversely, education focuses on trying to influence participants' cognitive or thinking processes. This kind of education might increase profound knowledge or critical thinking skills, and this could lead to behavior change.

What I advise my clients to do is to actually THINK like a search engine or if that is too abstract, think like someone who speaks a different language. \\n\\nAlthough search engines are getting much better at figuring out exactly what it is that is on the page, remember it is often impossible for them to decipher Java, Javascript, Flash, and other non-HTML components. This is NOT to say don't use them, just use them when they are to be used appropriately.\\n\\nBecause search engines ARE getting better at figuring out what is on a page, spelling and grammar are also very important. The rule of thumb is no more than three misspellings and no more than three gramatical errors on a page. Sentences should be of short to medium length and paragraphs should also be rather short.\\n\\nDO NOT COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK. The search engines can penalize a site heavily for plagiarism.\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nTitle Tags -- The most important of all tags is the Title tag. This is what shows up on the bars on the bottom of your computer screen. Most people make the mistake of putting their company name in the Title Tag and that is the worst thing to do (other than putting no tag at all). A Title Tag should be short and to the point and tell what the page is about and if you want to add your company name then add it at the END of the title tag not at the beginning.\\n\\nMeta Tags -- Meta tags were how search engines would know what was on a page... many years ago. However, with that said it is important that Meta tags are still added to your site and more importantly there are new meta tags (more than just description and keywords) that should be added to the web site such as content type and content language.\\n\\nMeta Description -- Meta description should start out with the SAME thing your TITLE tag says and then go into more detail. \\n\\nMeta Keywords -- Meta keywords are words used to describe what is in your page. First use keywords that are in the title and the description first. Then use keywords that are in the content of the page. DO NOT try to spam the search engines by using keywords that are not relevant to your content.\\n\\nAlt Tags -- With the advent of XHTML, ALT tags for images are now REQUIRED. The Alt tag is used for people who have their images turned off so it is important to have in the alt tag exactly what the image is but also expand on what it is. An example would be a HOME button. Instead of just having HOME as the Alt Tag, use Home -- Site Name.com. \\n\\nI have noticed that search engines love geography and it is good to put that in there whenever appropriate. If your company is in Kansas City, MO then put those in the Content and in the Tags.\\n\\nLINKS\\n\\nHaving links that send people to sites relevant to your site is always a good practice. People ask me where I get links and how do I get people to link to my site. The answer is very simple. First I ask. I write e-mails (NOT SPAM) to sites asking if they wish to reciprocate links with me and I also have on some of my pages a \"Link to this Page\" button so that web site owners can do it on their own.\\n\\nThere is great debate as to whether links to other sites that are not of the same category help, hurt, or are indifferent. From my ten years experience I have found that appropriate links DO NOT hurt your web site and could very well help in some instances.\\n\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\n\\nI won't go into much detail here but make sure you have one. So many people forget this and it is extremely important. You will NOT find a major web page that does not have a Privacy Policy attached to it.\\n\\nTRAFFIC\\n\\nObviously the more traffic you have coming to your web site the better. Not only ar",

Writing in a special review of sleep in the current issue of Nature, Dr Siegel says that it may be related to defence against oxidative stress. Smaller animals have higher metabolic rates, and this results in the generation of higher levels of small, highly reactive molecules such as free radicals. Studies on rats show that when they are deprived of sleep, their oxidative stress increases. Dr Siegel proposes that animals with higher metabolic rates need more sleep to interrupt and protect against this kind of oxidative damage, as well as repairing any damage done.",

Not because it can't be done, but because you would need to work with clients that are able to set up the hardware and software on their own sites. Usually, people hire you to solve problems -- and the video conferencing has a serious potential to CREATE problems, especially long distance.\\n\\nBefore you launch a VA practice, research the name you plan to use for the business (an Internet search is a great place to begin) because you don't want to use a name that's already in use (and possibly trademark protected).\\n\\nThen consider your strengths and weaknesses. Do an honest self-assessment to determine what services you can offer that will benefit your clients while emphasising your skills, background and education without requiring you to delve into areas that are not your best.\\n\\nIf you are going to be a VA, a website is essential. If creating a good website isn't your strength -- hire it out or barter services with someone else who can create an effective site.\\n\\nMarket yourself everywhere you go (business cards at the ready). And, always look for opportunities to talk about what you do -- this is most easily achieved by asking others about their own work (they will usually return the favor). Although Virtual Assistance is a known term in many circles, it still seems to create a bit of interest in casual conversation -- use that to your advantage by begin able to answer questions about the industry in general and your own business in particular.\\n\\nRead articles by others on the topic of running your own VA business.\\n\\nBe sure you are willing to put in the hours required to start and run a business. It's not as simple as announcing and starting to work. You will need to research your market, talk with people in the business, talk with people in your target industry/industries, read, research on the web and...

It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\\n\\nIn a human male orgasm, there are rapid, rhythmic contractions of the prostate, urethra and the muscles at the base of the penis, which (in the adult) typically force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. This is referred to as ejaculation. The process usually takes from 3 to 10 seconds. The process is usually, but not always, extremely pleasurable. Orgasm is generally induced by direct stimulation of the penis. Some men experience heightened orgasm by direct stimulation of the prostate through the perineum.\\n\\nFollowing ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs during which a man cannot have another orgasm. This period can be anywhere from less than a minute to over half a day, depending on age and other individual factors. A very few cases have been reported of men who appear to have no refractory period at all. Scientists theorize that a pituitary gland disorder or difference may cause this unique ability.\\n\\nIn a human female orgasm, orgasm is preceded by moistening of the vaginal walls, and an enlargement of the clitoris due to increased blood flow trapped in the clitoris's spongy tissue. Some women exhibit a sex flush; a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman comes closer to having orgasm, the clitoris moves inward under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (minor lips) becomes darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the vagina decreases in size by about 30% and also becomes congested with blood. The uterus then experiences muscular contractions. A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. The majority of women consider these contractions to be very pleasurable.\\n\\nAfter the orgasm is over, the clitoris re-emerges from under the clitoral hood, and returns to its normal size in less than 10 minutes. Unlike men, women either do not have a refractory period or have a very short one, and thus can experience a second orgasm soon after the first; some women can even follow this with a third, or even fourth orgasm; this is known as having multiple orgasms. After the initial orgasm, subsequent climaxes may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates. Research shows that about 13% of women experience multiple orgasms; a larger number may be able to experience this with the proper stimulation (such as a vibrator) and frame of mind. However, some women's clitorises are too sensitive after orgasm, making additional stimulation painful; they are probably not able to experience multiple orgasms",

Either by running away or fighting the tiger(metaphorically or literally).  digestion is absolutely one of them.  when in a stressful situation your bowels are the last thing you need to think about if per say, primatively speaking, you are being chased by a tiger.  some people evacuate immediately: diarrhea or hold it in until they are safe: constipation.   if they are under constant stress, then the body perceives this as a signal to continue coping as it has been which could cause constant constipation and/or diarrhea or other problems such as hormonal imbalances(because when you are super-stressed for example having a baby is the last thing your body can handle), weight gain or loss etc..  \\nSuggestions:\\n(I have a theory, see if it fits).

Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process. Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.\\nNicotine replacement therapy\\nIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin (transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch) , the nasal mucosa (nicotine nasal spray) or the buccal mucosa (nicotine chewing gum). Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\n      Transdermal Nicotine Patches\\n      The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated, and provides constant, steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn. They are quite simple to use, help prevent weight gain, cravings, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable\\n      Side Effects of the patch\\n      Patches may cause a local skin reaction,and insomnia with nightmares may occur.\\n\\n      Overdosing in nicotine is possible, especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch. Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack.\\n      Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products...i.e. no smoking or chewing tobacco.\\n\\n      Cost\\n      Patches are expensive and cost close to $100 per month of use.\\n      However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $1000 per year, which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car.\\n      Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money. Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know. However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system, and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine. the key word here is reliable.\\n\\n      The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream. The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate, and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this. Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin. Individual differences in skin thickness, location of the applied patch, and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered.\\n      3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch\\n          o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms)\\n          o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled.\\n          o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met.\\n          o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely.\\n\\n      It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use, others shorter. If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch.\\n\\n      Types of nicotine patches\\n            Nicotrol\\n            15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches\\n     ",

It's also pretty wide - wider than her old tower by 2-3 inches.  \\n\\nBecause my client wanted several measures of reliability and backup, we had the system preconfigured with a mirrored RAID array (2x250GB HDs), a DVD+/-RW drive for ad hoc backups, and an external harddrive for scheduled backups that can backup the entire drive.  Since she also wanted to be able to do graphics editing in the future, we got the machine with a GeForce 6800 graphics card (leaving open the option to add a second card in SLI configuration at a later date, if needed, though if they'd offered the option earlier, I would have recommended the 7800 GTX) and got a good 5.1 sound card installed as well (hooked up to old speakers, but WTF - it's her money) and 2GB RAM, with room to go up to 4GB if needed.\\n\\nFor external expansion, it comes with 8 USB 2.0 ports, and 3(?) firewire ports.  6 of the USB ports are in the back, with 2 firewire, while 3 are in front, behind a small panel.  We actually used most of the USB ports while setting up most of her peripherals, but you can always add a USB 2.0 high speed hub if you have that many additional devices.    If you have older keyboards and/or mice you're fond of that are PS/2, the machine does have ports for those as well.   (My client is still using a 10-year old keyboard from her old 486 PC that ran Windows 95.  I think it's Dorian Grey's keyboard, and has a printout of itself aging in a closet somewhere.)  If you have an old parallel printer though, it does NOT have a parallel port, so you'll need a parallel to USB cable or you'll need to order a parallel port card.\\n\\nFrom a software standpoint, the machine is very nice to use - everything runs very smoothly (in part thanks to the dual core CPU) with the only hiccup being AOL, which was preinstalled, but still has problems even in version 9.0 with playing well with Internet Explorer, since AOL uses the IE kernel for its own browsing component - running the two at the same time caused problems.\\n\\nAll in old, I'd say this is an excellent PC, competitive with other high end PCs from boutique manufacturers.  Where it falls short is the ability to get Dell on the phone - even with \"a separate queue just for XPS users\", we were on hold for close to an hour without ever speaking with a representative when trying to find out whether the shipped PC actually matched the original specs fro when the PC was ordered through the website.  Smaller PC vendors, such as Falcon-Northwest, VoodooPC, Monarch, and ABS are much better about being responsive to customers after the sale than Dell was here.  Aside from that, it's an excellent PC.",

The religion of Islam is not named after a person as in the case of Christianity which was named after Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Gotama Buddha, Confucianism after Confucius, and Marxism after Karl Marx. Nor was it named after a tribe like Judaism after the tribe of Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus. Islam is the true religion of \"Allah\" and as such, its name represents the central principle of Allah's \"God's\" religion; the total submission to the will of Allah \"God\". The Arabic word \"Islam\" means the submission or surrender of one's will to the only true god worthy of worship \"Allah\" and anyone who does so is termed a \"Muslim\", The word also implies \"peace\" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Hence, it was not a new religion brought by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) I in Arabia in the seventh century, but only the true religion of Allah re-expressed in its final form. \\n\\nIslam is the religion which was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind. The name of God's religion lslam was not decided upon by later generations of man. It was chosen by Allah Himself and clearly mentioned in His final revelation to man. In the final book of divine revelation, the Qur'aan, Allah states the following:\\n\\n\\n\"This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion\". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3)\\n\\n\\n\"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will It be accepted of Him\" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85)\\n\\n\\n\"Abraham was not a Jew nor Christian; but an upright Muslim.\" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:67)\\n\\n              Islam is the way of life for those who believe in God and want to live a life in worship and obedience to none but God.

War can be traced back to the Indo-European root *wers-, “to confuse, mix up.” In the Germanic family of the Indo-European languages, this root gave rise to several words having to do with confusion or mixture of various kinds. One was the noun *werza-, “confusion,” which in a later form *werra- was borrowed into Old French, probably from Frankish, a largely unrecorded Germanic language that contributed about 200 words to the vocabulary of Old French. From the Germanic stem came both the form werre in Old North French, the form borrowed into English in the 12th century, and guerre (the source of guerrilla) in the rest of the Old French-speaking area. Both forms meant “war.” Meanwhile another form derived from the same Indo-European root had developed into a word denoting a more benign kind of mixture, Old High German wurst, meaning “sausage.” Modern German Wurst was borrowed into English in the 19th century, first by itself (recorded in 1855) and then as part of the word liverwurst (1869), the liver being a translation of German Leber in Leberwurst.",

He was 63. \\n\\nMcDaniel, who lost both of his kidneys about 4 1/2 years ago, died Thursday night at Cy-Fair Medical Clinic in Houston, his oldest daughter said. He'd been in failing health in recent years, often undergoing kidney dialysis. McDaniel was on a waiting list to receive a kidney transplant. \\n\\nHe was born in Bernice, La., on June 19, 1938, and was a schoolboy football star at Midland (Texas) High School in the 1950s. \\n\\nMcDaniel moved on to the University of Oklahoma, where he lettered at linebacker from 1957-59. He holds the school record for the longest punt with a 91-yarder against Iowa State in 1958. \\n\\n\"He was a wild, crazy Indian,\" daughter Nicky Rowe said Friday. \"He was bigger than life. He was just amazing.\" \\n\\nThe 5-foot-11, 280-pound McDaniel was selected by Los Angeles in the second round of the American Football League draft in 1960. He bounced around the AFL for much of his eight-year career, spending time with the Houston Oilers, Denver Broncos, New York Jets and, finally, the Miami Dolphins. \\n\\nBy the end of his football career, McDaniel had already established himself as a big name in minor-league wrestling circuits around the country. But as a member of the Jets, McDaniel began to headline wrestling events at Madison Square Garden with the help of the arena's owner, Sonny Werblin. Werblin also was involved in the ownership of the Jets. \\n\\nMcDaniel capitalized on the stardom from his gridiron days to make a smooth transition into full-time wrestling. He became one of the country's most popular and beloved wrestlers during the '60s, '70s and '80s. \\n\\n\"He was one of the first to make transition from football to wrestling,\" said Bob Ryder, who operates the wrestling Web site, 1wrestling.com. \"When he found out he was making more money as a wrestler than a football player, he gave up football. He was such a big star.\" \\n\\nOver the course of his 30-year wrestling career, McDaniel had memorable battles with wrestling stars such as \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and Sgt. Slaughter. He won several titles before retiring in 1989. \\n\\n\"I wrestled all the top wrestlers in the world, and I traveled a lot,\" McDaniel said once. \"I got to see a lot of places that I probably wouldn't have gotten to see.\" \\n\\nHe was also fiercely proud of his Chickasaw Indian heritage and always entered the ring with his trademark elaborate feather headdress. \\n\\nShortly after retiring, health problems limited McDaniel to one of his newfound passions -- golf. He lived in Charlotte, N.C., until recently, but moved to Houston to live with his daughter and son-in-law as his health began to deteriorate. \\n\\n\"He also became a mentor to a lot of other wrestlers,\" Rowe said. \"He was so famous, I just didn't realize it until now. We've got so many calls from people.\" \\n\\nRowe said the family plans to cremate McDaniel's body and scatter the ashes over a lake near Del Rio, which was once the favorite fishing spot for her father and grandfather. They also plan to hold a memorial service for McDaniel in Midland next week. \\n\\nHe is survived by two daughters and a son.",

When I decided what to go on, I thought about what I'd have to do for it.  I was a bit worried about giving myself a shot, and I figured that I would need to have the least intrusive method of medication delivery... so I decided subcutaneous (just under the skin).  That cut down the list of interferons... \\n\\nThen I thought about side effects, a lot of the interferons have flu like symptoms.  When I started the meds, I was feeling weak, pins and needly, and limpy.  I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that.  No siree.\\n\\nI mean, you really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends.  It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!).  That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place.  My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone.  Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect.\\n\\nI WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots.  Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so you don't even have to see the needle.  Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs.  I gave it to myself without hesitation the first time!  I am a little wary of someone else doing it (though she had recommended that my fiance learn how, too).\\n\\nResult?  Well, there's not much to say!  (that's a good thing)... my original symptoms had faded, and I don't know if that was the copaxone or what.  I've been on it since 2/2004 (wow!  going on 2 years soon!), and I have NO NEW LESIONS!  boy, that's more exciting than I thought it was going to be.\\n\\nNow, your milage WILL vary, and unlike my first time experience, you will LIKELY have to go through a few drugs to find one you like.\\n\\nGood luck to you!",

Our solar system was all formed at that time. \\n\\nHow did the moon form?\\nWe think that the moon and Earth formed at about the same time, back when our whole solar system was formed. Earth was forming from many chunks of rock and icy material. Possibly a big chunk hit the new Earth and knocked loose a big piece, which became the moon. \\n\\nHow hot and cold does it get on the moon?\\nAs you may have learned, the moon doesn't have any air around it. The air that surrounds our earth acts as a nice blanket to keep us warm and comfy! But the moon, since it doesn't have this blanket, gets much colder than the earth — and much hotter than the earth. On the side of the moon that the sun is shining on, the temperature reaches 260°Fahrenheit! That is hotter than boiling. On the dark side of the moon, it gets very cold, -280° Fahrenheit. \\n\\nWhat is the surface of the moon like?\\nThe surface of the moon has about two inches of dust. Much of this dust has fallen to the moon from the spaces between the planets over the last several billions years. It probably feels pretty soft. You can see this in some pictures taken by the astronauts of their footprints on the moon. \\n\\nHow many holes are in the moon?\\nWe call those holes \"craters.\" They are the places where many years ago meteors hit the surface of the moon and put dents into it. There are thousands of big craters, but even more little ones. There are probably millions of little craters on the moon! Some are only an inch or so across. \\n\\nWhy does the moon have big rocks?\\nThe moon is made up of various kinds of rocks. These rocks are fairly similar to the rocks on earth. But on earth, we have wind and rain that help wear the rocks down into sand and dirt. There is no air or wind on the moon, so the rocks don't get worn down as they do on the earth. \\n\\nHow many moons are there all together?\\nEarth has only one moon. If you count all the moons around all the planets in our solar system, there are 61 (Earth has one, Mars has two, Jupiter has 16, Saturn has 18, Uranus has 15, Neptune has 8, and Pluto has one). There may be more that we haven't discovered yet! \\n\\nWhy does the moon change its shape (as in full, half, and quarter moon)?\\nThe bright part of the moon is the part that the sun is shining on. This is like daytime on earth. The dark part is in shadow, like night on earth. Now the moon goes around the earth once every 29 days (approximately). \\n\\nAt new moon, the moon and the sun are on the same side of Earth. We see the part of the moon that is in shadow, so the moon is dark. Then the moon moves around in its orbit. At first quarter, it has gone one-fourth of the way around Earth. Now we can see part of the moon that is sunlit, but part still in shadow. Note that if the sun is setting in the west, the bright part of the moon is on the side toward the sun and the dark part is away. \\n\\nAbout a week later, the moon has moved halfway around its orbit. Now it is on the opposite side of Earth, away from the sun. Now we see only the sunlit side — that is the full moon. Note that if the sun is setting in the west, the moon is just rising in the east. \\n\\nAbout a week later, the moon has moved now three-fourths of the way around in its circle around Earth. Once again only part of the moon is sunlit and part is dark. Now you can see the moon in the morning, and note that once again the sunlit side is on the side towards the sun, and the shadow side away. Another week and we are back to the new moon. \\n\\nIt's easier to demonstrate if you have a ball to represent the moon and a flashlight for the sun. Have someone stand several feet away, holding the flashlight so it shines on the bal",

As such, the crew was directed to make sure the first and second class passengers were attended to first. That wasn't right to do at all, but that's just how it was. \\n\\n(3) It's mainly the fault of the shipbuilders who only put 20 lifeboats on the ship, which wasn't enough for half the passengers. Sharing in the blame would have to be the officer who tried to turn the ship when it was too close already, since the ship wouldn't have sunk if it hit the iceberg head on. It was also the captain's fault for not taking the necessary precautions with the ship when he knew they were headed directly into an ice field.\\n\\n(4) The shipbuilders wanted as much \"ooh and ahh\" over the ship as they could get from the public. That's why they fostered the belief that the ship was \"unsinkable\", and that the ship itself was one big lifeboat. Those in charge also felt that the extra boats would have cluttered up the ship's deck. \\n\\n(5) They didn't prepare for this because they were arrogant and felt that they had the greatest ship in all of history and nothing would ever happen to it.\\n\\n(6) Greed is why people tried to take and sell Titanic artifacts. It was all about the $$$. \\n\\n(7) Titanic's victims are long-gone.
