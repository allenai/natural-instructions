Any questions? \nBuyer: Yeah, is there anything wrong with the interior? Or any reason why the miles are so low?\nSeller: Please note that the listing does say it is a salvage title. The interior is in great condition though!\nBuyer: Oh, it doesn't say that when I look at it. Well... in that case would you take $5000 for it? I'm going to have to get it checked out by a mechanic and I'm  not sure what else I might have to do to repair it, so I think that's what I'd like to pay.\nSeller: That is far too low. The accident was a small accident and the value is still more than double your offer despite that. Can you make a reasonable offer? \nBuyer: It is a 7 year old car even without a salvage title.

I have excellent credit and have excellent references\nSeller: I can accept your offer of 1550 if you either commit to one year, or pay a two months' deposit upfront.

We could loser the price to about 1700 if that would help.\nBuyer: The pool and gated community are nice but many communities have that for a lower price and again it does not have private laundry and so I have to pay extra for that as well.

Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)\nBuyer: That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan.

The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.\nBuyer: If you don't mind if I play my collection of barbershop quartet cds rather loudly, so as to help drown out the rock music, I'll consider $1200.\nSeller: Okay, I'll take that deal.\nBuyer: Agreed.\nSeller: \nSeller: Okay, I look forward to practicing my poll dance moves to your music :)\nBuyer: \n"

Look, let's get to brass tacks, I'm willing to go as high as $1750, and frankly I'm crazy to do that.\nSeller: Sir I will have you know that Spice 1 and the 187 Faculty do their laundry on site here at least once a week!! Once a goshdarn week! Don't look down your nose at me, we like our toilets facing stairs here in Hayward. It gives us a combat advantage. I will go down to 1,900 only because you reminded me to pick up ranch dressing.\nBuyer: Okay, $1900 it is.\nBuyer: \nSeller: Oh. Sorry for the yelling. I need to smoke.\nSeller: \n"

For right now, the lowest I will go is $90.\nBuyer: I would appreciate it if you consider going down a bit more, because I also need to come pick it up so its also commute in here. Please consider going down a bit.\nSeller: I am more than willing to drop this off with you.

The swimming pool and saunas are included in the rent though?\nSeller: Certainly those are included ammenities of our community that every resident has access too at the designated times. You may also purchase a pool key for $15 dollars however we ask that you please leave the pool by 11pm \nBuyer: Then just one last question. Can you have a washer and dryer in your apartment?\nSeller: Yes you are more than welcome to use your own or rent a pair from us for no more than $25 extra in rent. However do note if you do use your own you would be held responsible from any damages that may occur due to an unfortunate malfunction. \nBuyer: All sounds good to me. I would like to pay 1350 \nSeller: Unfortunately that is not acceptable for our community. I can do 1800 while also throwing in a free pool key\nBuyer: Okay I'll take that. \nSeller: Thank you very much we look forward to having you live with us.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

I could go $3800\nBuyer: 3,000 is my final offer\nSeller: I can't go that low. Sorry\nSeller: \n"

Can we maybe work on that ?\nSeller: i am willing to negotiate\nBuyer: How about $468?\nSeller: thats far too low, i would be losing a considerable amount of money if i let them go at that price. I can make a counter offer of $680. Thats $100 off, and I feel is more than reasonable\nBuyer: Well since its new I can take that. Would you be willing to ship it to me?\nSeller: i can meet you at the local starbucks for pickup\nBuyer: Okay deal\nBuyer: \nSeller: wonderful\nSeller: \n"

The elementary and middle schools are also within walking distance, but the high school requires transportation.\nBuyer: That shouldn't be an issue as my son has his license.

That's as high as I can go.\nSeller: Can you talk about your maintenance experience? With a full time class load and 20 hours of week elsewhere, what type of time do you think you would have to dedicate to work here? \nBuyer: I've worked for a landscaping company every summer for 4 years. My father is a contractor,  and I've also worked with him.  My job is all weekdays, so my weekends would be open.\nSeller: How about 1250. You are responsible for 6 hours of work a month assigned by the property manager. That works out to a rate of about $25.00 discount, but you would be responsible for paying the full balance if you are not able to complete the work.

I'll go $2600\nBuyer: \nSeller: Okay, great, I look forward to seeing you.\nSeller: \n"

Hmm, looks like the tires will need to be replaced soon, the tread is pretty worn. Can we take $1,000 off the price?\nSeller: How about 600 off at 3500, we already sunk in some serious money to make sure it was otherwise perfect for you\nBuyer: I realize that.. But these tires, do you see when I place this tired tread gauge in, they are almost illegally bald? i will have to replace all 4 very soon, which will cost about $200 each..

These were not answered in your above answer.\nSeller: No utilities and the unit is only in its 5 th year however all appliances are upgrades and so are the fixtures so I can promise a fairly low utility bill in relation to your utility usage\nBuyer: The monthly price is a bit steep, are you able to negotiate?\nSeller: You know what normally i would say no but im gonna go talk to my manager and see what he say give me a few \nBuyer: Okay, thank you so much.\nSeller: Oh my God this never happens my.

I am new to the area and things are a little tight right now. I would also be a long term renter.\nSeller: I am really sorry. That's.  The most I've ever seen him do to be honest he normally maxes out at 5 off.

I dont want to bother him too much or else his mood may go bad\nBuyer: Awe, that is still pretty steep.\nSeller: Give me another few mins ill grill him a little more\nBuyer: Okay, thank you. I really hope you can get him down more. Like I said, I would be a long term renter and I pay on time every month.\nSeller: ok so I spoke to him and he got a little annoyed but that may have worked in your favor he said 900 and that's it final offer\nBuyer: Is all the above terms still apply to this offer? No application fee, and free first months rent and a key to the gym?\nSeller: Why of course and i promise as soon as you move in you will see the value of the place\nSeller: \nBuyer: Okay, you got yourself a deal.\nBuyer: \n"

The Ipad is just for reading in bed at night until I fall asleep. I have all the original accessories that came with it, plus I have all the latest apps.\nBuyer: Last questions:  How long does the battery last when fully charged?\nSeller: Now that is why this baby is the bomb. It can go six days or more. I have a battery saver app downloaded, that makes power consumption very low. I have gone over two weeks without charging it but I make sure to charge it once a week so the batteries will last\nBuyer: Sounds good.  The only issue I have is that the image on the add is broken.  So I would be forced to take your word 100% on the condition and accuracy of the item.  Will you sell it to me for $150?\nSeller: I can assure you that you will not have to take my word for anything. Since we are in the same city I will deliver the product or we can meet up in a public place and you can see it for yourself. I am letting it go for way more than it is worth at $175. Even a refurbished one, which has damage would run you $250 or more in the store.

I would be willing to be  around $1400. Maybe more for pets\nSeller: lowest we can accept is 1500, with the current policies. Im sorry but this will have to be the final offer. I hope we can make this work.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

Can you show me the title/deed?\nSeller: I am Rafa but unsure why I would need to show you the title/deed to a house that you are renting. :-) Please know, I could rent this out for hundreds of dollars a DAY should I chose. Check air bnb. You will see I am correct.\nBuyer: Yeah, that makes sense, I was making sure I'm not getting scammed because the word hookups is in the listing. Alright, my budget is closer to 2700, can you do that?\nSeller: I could! Happy to do so.  BTW - Hookups just mean there are places to hook up your washer and dryer as they aren't included! Glad we could come to an agreement\nSeller: \nBuyer: Ohhhh, thank you. I was confused. Have a good one.\nBuyer: \n"

We like to replace all carpets after tenants who have pets -- even if there is not extensive damage, we find new tenants enjoy the brand-new features. If you think you might be interested in a tour, we can set something up?\nBuyer: We can but the price seems a bit steep for only 2 bedrooms. I know the asking price is $2595 but would $2000 be doable?\nSeller: Sorry, no. That's much too low for the area. I'm confident we'll have interest in the apartment at $2595.

I could do $70 for two and get them off your hands.\nSeller: Like I said I am willing to lower my price, but you need to be fair to me or I take a personal loss.\nBuyer: I have another card, but it's too small for me to use. How about $50 for yours and I'll give you my used 100gb. I'm sure if a new 200gb card is $75, a used 100gb must at least be worth $25.\nSeller:  I have no use for your card, just more of a hassle to sell. I will take 60 for one sd card.\nBuyer: I guess I can do that. \nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

My budget's closer to 1000 and it's used, but let me know\nSeller: Well given that it was barely used I think I could drop it down to $1500 for you but $1000 is a little too low for me. \nBuyer: R8R\nSeller: What do you think?\nBuyer: Sorry about that, I meant to say I found a premade R8R for 1500 so I was confused why the frame itself was running me the same price.

And then, at the moment, there's plenty of ample parking because we have unsold units. We anticipate there will always be at least two parking spots for you, even during busy season.\nBuyer: Well, it's good to hear that you would accept our cat.  And while there is plenty of parking now, we will need at least a spot for each of us.  But how about distance to BART, the transit station?

It says High Speed Internet Access. Who is the provider and is that included in the rent or do we pay separately?\nSeller: We have XFINITY, which is Comcast, and its included in the rent.  Also included in the rent are the appliances such as laundry, washer, dryer, gas stove and range, as well as a fitness center. Seems like a good deal, no?\nBuyer: So both water and electricity are included in the rent?  How about garbage?  And is there a separate fee for using the swimming pool?\nSeller: Well no, I don't believe any place includes the water and electricity at this price. We'll take care of the garbage and take it out for you, and no, the fee is included for the swimming pool because we have staff that maintain it.\nBuyer: Well, that doesn't sound like a bad deal.

I can tell you about a couple features if you'd like?\nBuyer: From what I've read, It sounds like what I've been looking for! However, I've been to a few others, and the price is a little high for the area.\nSeller: The price is a little bit higher than other places in the area, but this apartment has some things most others don't.  10 feet high ceilings, ceramic tile floors, two skylights and even an off street parking spot.  You know how hard those are to find here.  The deposit is 1,500 firm, but I do have a little bit of wiggle room on the price.  Around what price are you looking for?\nBuyer: My budget is around $2600 a month, would that work for you?\nSeller: How about we meet in the middle.  How does 2,775 sound?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.\nBuyer: I wish I could! I'd love to rent this apartment. It sounds great. Unfortunately, the most I can offer is $2700. \nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

That's about all I can afford at this time. \nSeller: Do you have an old fishing pole or skis that you don't use any more?

Kia isn't necessarily a brand that has longevity in terms of resale value. \nSeller: You are right, but it also only has 46,000 original miles on it. It has only had 2 owners and no accidents what so ever. At the end of the day, any car hold value as long as you keep up with it. The lowest I could go is 2900\nBuyer: My problem is the blue book value is only 2787 IF the car was in pristine condition. In your add you mention fading on the bumper which would take the overall value down. At most the car is worth 2000, but with all the money I would have to put in to it the highest I could go is 1700.\nSeller: Actually the blue book value for its condition is 2800 as I had it appraised and have the paperwork for it as well. I will go to 2500, but I di have other offers as well. \nBuyer: I could split the difference and go 2100\nSeller: Ok 2100 is good . \nSeller: \nBuyer: Solid. Thanks!\nBuyer: \n"

The lowest I could go is $40 and even that's pushing it.\nBuyer: How about $40, but you give me another piece of small furniture to make it worth it.  And I will pick up the furniture from you. Deal?\nSeller: I have a small end table that sort of matches the chair, and if you pick it up we're good to go. $40 it is. \nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

You can secure the apartment for the discounted price of $1800 if you sign the lease today.  Are you interested?\nBuyer: I am interested, but that price is too much for my family. We have budgeted for $1000 monthy rent. We can pay our deposit today if that monthly price will work for you.\nSeller: We cannot afford to rent for $1000.

How about if I waive your security deposit and have you sign a 3-year lease.  This way you go into the rental with a bit of extra cash to allow you to reorganize your budget.  I can lower the rent to $1750 if you are willing to do this.  Water is included, but not electric at this price.  Deal?\nBuyer: That is much appreciated. We can almost fit that into our budget.

I will polish it very nice and all the gears are completely oiled with a 3 in 1 oil. This will ensure no corrision on the chain and the spokes. It also ensures the chain stays completely linked to the drive spoke.\nBuyer: Riiiiight... that does not mean anything to me, honey your wasting your time with all that shop talk.

That takes away any value it had as a vintage item. \nSeller: Hmm, well it sounds like you probably aren't interested then.  As a non-vintage bike, it's worth 200.  The vintage should add on to it.

Versatile.\nSeller: $1250 and you can have the bike.\nBuyer: Okay, but can I get help with my posture as well? I hate the way I hunch.\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

I've done some serious work to this car.\nBuyer: Fair, but I go get a 2017 from a dealer for a little more than you're asking.  If I pick up the car and handle all of the paperwork would you consider 38000?\nSeller: 38,000 just seems too low to me. I could do 41000 as long as you pay in cash, as well as picking up the car and taking care of all the paperwork yourself\nBuyer: I can do 40,000 cash, pick up and paperwork, but I'd expect the remainder of BMW's factory warranty to be transferred too.

How about $8500? \nSeller: This car books out at around 15000 with all the options and the low mileage I could maybe go down to 9000 if you come get it today\nBuyer: Fair enough, $9000 would be fine.\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

You can't even notice it and that area on the screen works normal as well\nBuyer: 200 is pretty good, but the crack makes me nervous.
