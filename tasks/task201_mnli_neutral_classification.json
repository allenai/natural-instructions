    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a statement and three sentences as choices. Your job is to determine the neural choice based on your inference from the statement and your commonsense knowledge. The neural choice is a sentence that neither agrees nor disagrees with the statement. Indicate your answer as '1', '2', or '3', corresponding to the choice number of the selected sentence. If sentence X agrees with sentence Y, one's correctness follows from the other one. If sentence X disagrees with sentence Y, they can not be correct at the same time.",
