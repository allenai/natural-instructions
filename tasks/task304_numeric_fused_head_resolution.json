        "In this task, you will use your knowledge about language (and common sense) to determine what element the marked number refers to. The numbers are marked with two underlines around them, like: _ number _. There are several possible answers, you'll need to choose the proper one. Carefully read the given text, pay special attention to the marked number, think about what (unwritten) information the marked number holds inside, choose the most adequate word(s) from the optional answers. If none of them seems right to you, there's also an option for other. If your answer is \"REFERENCE\", also write the reference entity, otherwise write the implicit option name. Options to choose from are:\nREFERENCE: Some object which is being mentioned in the text before or after the target number. The reference answer has a higher priority than any other. If both Reference and another answer are possible, prioritize the Reference.\nYEAR: Describing a calendric year\nAGE: Describing someone's age\nCURRENCY: Reference to some monetary value e.g dollar, euro etc...\nPEOPLE: Describing a single/plural persons\nTIME: Describing a time of the day. Usually can add the word o'clock after those numbers.\nOTHER: Some other option, which isn't listed here."

Sufferers desperately want to be thin , and often transform their bodies to such an extent that menstruation ceases , and they revert to a pre - pubescent stage .\nWoman #2: Do anorexics ever get hungry ?\nNarrator: The term anorexia means lack of appetite , yet those who suffer from it are obsessed with food and its preparation , while they deny their own hunger and their body 's need for nutrients .\nWoman #3: Do they really think they look attractive like that ?\nNarrator: Anorectics often have a distorted perception of their actual body size . Although experts still can not account for this basic misrecognition , they do point out that the rigorous self discipline imposed by the anorectic is often the cause of an extreme exhilaration or high which accompanies and rewards her denial of food .",

We had the worst financial crisis , the Great Recession , the worst since the 1930s . That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy , failed to invest in the middle class , took their eyes off of Wall Street , and created a perfect storm . In fact , Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis . He said , back in 2006 , \" Gee , I hope it does collapse , because then I can go in and buy some and make some money . \" Well , it did collapse .\nHimself - Candidate: That 's called business , by the way .\nHerself - Candidate: Nine million people - nine million people lost their jobs . Five million people lost their homes . And $ 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out . Now , we have come back from that abyss . And it has not been easy . So we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy , but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place . Independent experts have looked at what I 've proposed and looked at what Donald 's proposed , and basically they 've said this , that if his tax plan , which would blow up the debt by over $ 5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle - class families compared to the wealthy , were to go into effect , we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession . They 've looked at my plans and they 've said , OK , if we can do this , and I intend to get it done , we will have 10 million more new jobs , because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy . Take clean energy . Some country is going to be the clean - energy superpower of the 21st century . Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese . I think it 's real .\nHimself - Candidate: I did not . I did not . I do not say that .\nHerself - Candidate: I think science is real .\nHimself - Candidate: I do not say that .\nHerself - Candidate: And I think it 's important that we grip this and deal with it , both at home and abroad . And here 's what we can do . We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels . We can have enough clean energy to power every home . We can build a new modern electric grid . That 's a lot of jobs ; that 's a lot of new economic activity . So I 've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do , and I am determined that we 're going to get the economy really moving again , building on the progress we 've made over the last eight years , but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump ?\nHimself - Candidate: She talks about solar panels . We invested in a solar company , our country . That was a disaster . They lost plenty of money on that _ one _ . Now , look , I 'm a great believer in all forms of energy , but we 're putting a lot of people out of work . Our energy policies are a disaster . Our country is losing so much in terms of energy , in terms of paying off our debt . You ca n't do what you 're looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt . The Obama administration , from the time they 've come in , is over 230 years ' worth of debt , and he 's topped it . He 's doubled it in a course of almost eight years , seven - and - a - half years , to be semi- exact . So I will tell you this . We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs . And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand , because they 're not doing it . And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving , they 're gone . And , Hillary , I 'd just ask you this . You 've been doing this for 30 years . Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now ? For 30 years , you 've been doing it , and now you 're just starting to think of solutions .\nHerself - Candidate: Well , actually ...\nHimself - Candidate: I will bring - excuse me .

He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...\nBoomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .\nWizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .\nBoomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .\nWizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .\nBoomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !\nVegeta: It 's over _ 9000 _ !\nBoomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .\nWizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was 8000 . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...\nBoomstick: Dai - what now ?\nWizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .\nBoomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .\nWizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .\nBoomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !\nWizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...\nBoomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .\nWizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .\nBoomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .\nWizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .\nBoomstick: Which is light speed !\nGoku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .\nWizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , \" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . \" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .\nBoomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?\nWizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .\nBoomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .",

His engineering mastery has led to a massive army of unique robot warriors using the strangest fuel source , kidnapped animals .\nBoomstick: He 's PETA 's worst nightmare !\nWizard: His army is based around speed and defense , including Moto Bugs , Caterkillers , Buzz Bombers , Egg Pawns and SWATbots .\nBoomstick: But Eggman 's got way more than that ! His Egg Fleet is a huge armada of battleships , led by the massive Egg Carrier , which supports a huge front mounted laser cannon .\nWizard: The Eggman army is spearheaded by his deadliest robot warriors , the Badniks . The EggRobo is a smartbot crafted in Eggman 's own image and designed to carry out tasks Eggman himself would normally do .\nBoomstick: What 's this guy 's deal with eggs ?\nWizard: On its own , Silver Sonic appears slow and bulky but it is powered by a Chaos Emerald , making it a much faster and more practical machine .\nBoomstick: Then he made another robo - hog , Mecha Sonic , who focuses on firepower over speed !\nWizard: Mecha Sonic can even absorb Chaos energy to attain a short lived super form .\nBoomstick: But Eggman wanted more than just Sonic bots . Mecha Knuckles can glide and vomit giant rockets ...\nWizard: And E-101 Beta remains one of Eggman 's most versatile machines .\nBoomstick: He 's a flying robot with super speed , teleportation and a reflector shield ! He shoots homing missiles and kamehamehas and has one of my favorite defensive abilities ever , the backhand !\nWizard: The Shadow Androids are fast and durable and typically fight in groups of _ three _ . However , their design is so complex , they sometimes glitch in close combat . And speaking of glitches , despite being an absolute genius , Dr. Eggman appears to suffer from a peculiar personality disorder that sent him through several different \" phases \" .\nBoomstick: Let 's just hope that Scratch and Grounder phase does n't show up today .\nWizard: But none of Eggman 's creations have ever been as deadly or as successful as his ultimate killing machine ...\nBoomstick: Hyper Metal Sonic !\nWizard: Metal Sonic was specifically designed to be better than Sonic the Hedgehog in every way and was a complete success . Metal can move much faster than Sonic , easily reaching near mach 5 speeds . Metal 's abilities include Sonic 's spindash and homing attack , along with the impenetrable Black Shield .\nBoomstick: He 's also got a chest laser , rocket powered flight and the maximum overdrive attack , where he overloads his circuits to create a glowing energy field that 'll burn through pretty much anything !\nWizard: And that 's not all . Somehow , Eggman managed to make Metal Sonic an ever evolving force . Metal has the uncanny ability to scan and copy data from others , flawlessly replicating their abilities .\nBoomstick: Damn , Eggman sure stepped up his game !\nWizard: Absorbing enough power can transform Metal into a number of more impressive forms , all of which increase his abilities immeasurably .\nBoomstick: The only downside to giving Metal Sonic a super brain is Eggman sometimes has trouble keeping him in line .\nWizard: But even with his metallic minions waging his war , Dr. Eggman is perfectly willing to step into the battlefield himself . He pilots the Eggmobile , a fast single man pod with twin mounted machine guns . The Eggmobile 's most vital function , however , is its universal compatibility to operate almost all of Eggman 's machines .\nBoomstick: Like the humungous Death Egg Robot with its spiked rocket arms and lasers !\nWizard: Eggman is vicious and clever . He 's an expert at playing his opponents right into his hands . At the same time , though , he can be overly obsessive to the point of overlooking some important factors in an effort to concentrate on a single goal . But while this can be a perilous game for Eggman , it also makes him dangerously unpredictable .",

He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...\nBoomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .\nWizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .\nBoomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .\nWizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .\nBoomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !\nVegeta: It 's over 9000 !\nBoomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .\nWizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was _ 8000 _ . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...\nBoomstick: Dai - what now ?\nWizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .\nBoomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .\nWizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .\nBoomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !\nWizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...\nBoomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .\nWizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .\nBoomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .\nWizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .\nBoomstick: Which is light speed !\nGoku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .\nWizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , \" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . \" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .\nBoomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?\nWizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .\nBoomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .",

It travels 60 feet 6 inches from the pitcher 's mound to home - and it can cover that distance at nearly 100 miles an hour . Along the way it can be made to twist , spin , curve , wobble , rise , or fall away . The bat is made of turned ash , less than 42 inches long , not more than 2 3/4 inches in diameter . The batter has only a few thousandths of a second to decide to hit the ball . And yet the men who fail seven times out of _ ten _ are considered the game 's greatest heroes . It is played everywhere . In parks and playground and prison yards . In back alleys and farmers fields . By small children and by old men . By raw amateurs and millionare professionals . It is a leisurely game that demands blinding speed . The only game where the defense has the ball . It follows the seasons , beginning each year with the fond expectancy of springtime and ending with the hard facts of autumn . Americans have played baseball for more than 200 years , while they conquered a continent , warred with one another and with enemies abroad , struggled over labor and civil rights and the meaning of freedom . At the games 's heart lie mythic contradictions : a pastoral game , born in crowded cities ; an exhilarating democratic sport that tolerates cheating and has excluded as many as it has included ; a profoundly conservative game that some times manages to be years ahead of its time . It is an American odyssey that links sons and daughters to father and grandfathers . And it reflects a host of age - old American tensions : between workers and owners , scandal and reform , the individual and the collective . It is a haunted game , where each player is measured by the ghosts of those who have gone before . Most of all , it is about time and timelessness , speed and grace , failure and loss , imperishable hope , and coming home .",

I- if I 'm not mistaken , he worked with you here in Miami Metro .\nDexter Morgan: He was angry . Had a short fuse .\nDr. Evelyn Vogel: Well , that does n't sound right to me . As a psychopath , he would be disassociated with his feelings , not quick to anger .\nDexter Morgan: Maybe he was n't a psychopath .\nDr. Evelyn Vogel: Oh , yes , the Bay Harbor Butcher was definitely a psychopath . He 'd have to be to masquerade the way he did . But he was an odd _ one _ , that 's for sure .\nDexter Morgan: You 're the expert .\nDr. Evelyn Vogel: Just the way he picked his victims - persons who , on the whole , had some sort of criminal background - speaks to a ... strong belief system , almost as if he operated with some sort of ... moral guidelines .\nDexter Morgan: \" Guidelines \" .\nDr. Evelyn Vogel: Yeah , clearly it was n't a moral choice , as psychopaths have no conscience . So , why else would he kill that way ?\nDexter Morgan: So he could ... get away with it as long as he did ? People are less likely to miss criminals when they disappear . Doakes was Special Ops ; maybe he picked it up from there .\nDr. Evelyn Vogel: Maybe he did . Makes an interesting case study . I wish I could have interviewed him .\nDexter Morgan: Sorry .\nDr. Evelyn Vogel: I look forward to working with you , Dexter Morgan .",

So persistent was his desire to resurrect his dead mother that he actually dressed in female suits fashioned from human skin .

Answer in one word . \"\nTony Hitchman: Well , Mr. Hubbard , it 's obviously something that 's very wide - ranging , and if you ca n't describe it overall , perhaps we can begin at the beginning . How did you get into Scientology ? How did it all start ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Well , that - that is fairly easy . When I was , uh , a very young man , I spent most of my teens in Asia . And , uh , that is a , an area of the world , uh , where human misery and , uh , want , uh , are , uh , very visible , where , uh , Man has reached perhaps the lowest states of degradation , and a young man moving into that scene begins to ask the question , \" Why ? Why all this ? Why - What is this ? Uh , what depths can man fall to , and what is he , anyway ? \" And I began to ask this question , \" What is Man ? \" And , uh , I found oddly enough that nobody could tell me what Man was . Uh , what did he consist of , uh , where was he going , what was he doing ? I became very fascinated with this particular line of research and I made it my life 's work .\nTony Hitchman: Did you read widely of philosophy ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Yes , but the philosopher , of course , has spent most of his working years in his ivory towers , and he was pretty insulated from life . To really know life , you 've got to be part of life . You must get down and look , you must get into the , the nooks and crannies of existence there , you have to rub elbows with all kinds and types of men before you can finally establish what he is .\nTony Hitchman: And you in fact did this ?\nL. Ron Hubbard: Yes , I 've slept with bandits in Mongolia and I 've , uh , uh , hunted , uh , with , uh pygmies in the Phillipines ; as a matter of fact , I 've studied _ 21 _ , uh , different primitive races , uh , including the white race ...\nL.

Ron Hubbard: and , uh , uh , my conclusions , uh , were that , uh , Man , regardless of his state of culture , and so forth , was essentially the same , that he was composed of a , uh , - he was a spiritual being . And he was a spiritual being that was pulled down to the material , uh , the , uh , fleshly interests , the , uh , to an interplay in life that was in fact to great for him to confront . And I concluded finally , uh , that he needed a hand .",

They have to help us out .\nHimself - Moderator: Our last ...\nHimself - Candidate: As far as the nuclear is concerned , I agree . It is the single greatest threat that this country has .\nHimself - Moderator: Which leads to my next question , as we enter our last segment here the subject of securing America . On nuclear weapons , President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation 's longstanding policy on first use . Do you support the current policy ? Mr. Trump , you have two minutes on that .\nHimself - Candidate: Well , I have to say that , you know , for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia , she 's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries . But Russia has been expanding their - they have a much newer capability than we do . We have not been updating from the new standpoint . I looked the other night . I was seeing B-52s , they 're old enough that your father , your grandfather could be flying them . We are not - we are not keeping up with other countries . I would like everybody to end it , just get rid of it . But I would certainly not do first strike . I think that once the nuclear alternative happens , it 's over . At the same time , we have to be prepared . I ca n't take anything off the table . Because you look at some of these countries , you look at North Korea , we 're doing nothing there . China should solve that problem for us . China should go into North Korea . China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea . And by the way , another _ one _ powerful is the worst deal I think I 've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal . Iran is one of their biggest trading partners . Iran has power over North Korea . And when they made that horrible deal with Iran , they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea . And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places . And when asked to Secretary Kerry , why did n't you do that ? Why did n't you add other things into the deal ? One of the great giveaways of all time , of all time , including $ 400 million in cash . Nobody 's ever seen that before . That turned out to be wrong . It was actually $ 1.7 billion in cash , obviously , I guess for the hostages . It certainly looks that way . So you say to yourself , why did n't they make the right deal ? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history . The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems . All they have to do is sit back 10 years , and they do n't have to do much .",

You can yell until you 're blue in the face about how the concept of a proactive superhero team that has merchandising and appears on talk shows and are celebrities and crap is such a wonderful idea , and it 's just the execution that fails , but in the end , it does n't change that Youngblood sucks ! You can tell me about the runs from Alan Moore or the revived series from 2011 , and that 's great if they really are good , but it just keeps bringing me back to the question of why the hell anyone would want to do anything with this series when there is so much frigid ' baggage with it ! Look , my rant against the X - Men in my Next 15 Screw - Ups was half joking . I do n't hate the X - Men and there are plenty of bad stories out there that have nothing to do with them , and there are great runs on the X - Men books . But Youngblood is a team that does not deserve all the hard work of creators ! It 's a bunch of unmemorable ripoff characters , growling and gritting teeth , and saying really stupid things , and squinting and doing exaggerated poses and all that crap ! Let Youngblood die , already ! Just let it die ! Rob Liefeld does not deserve the amount of loyalty that he somehow has engendered ! What 's that ? Rob Liefeld is really enthusiastic about the industry and is really an awesome guy if you know him in person , and loves comics and everything about the medium ? Yeah , well , I 'm really enthusiastic about the medium , but no one says that I should be drawing comic books ! Rob Liefeld ca n't write ! Rob Liefeld ca n't draw ! Rob Liefeld ca n't create ! And do n't go telling me about how he created Deadpool and Cable ! One - he did n't create Deadpool ! He created some boring - ass mercenary who spoke in yellow - colored speech bubbles ! Nobody would give a damn about him if not for the work of everybody else but him ! And as for Cable , most of my knowledge of the character comes from the animated series , but even if Cable really is all that awesome and iconic a character , well , congratulations . You have found one , all of one character that Rob Liefeld created that 's actually good , except a good creator is capable of making more than just one good character ! Liefeld , on the other hand , settles on inventing 60000 characters , and none of them are good ! But to cite that Deadpool example again , is he really the _ one _ who created him if everything about the character that people like that was done by others ? You show me a Rob Liefeld character that people like , and I 'll show you the other creators who are responsible for you liking him . The point is , companies , stop giving him work ! Consumers , stop buying things with his name on it ! And my fans , stop telling me about movies that are supposedly being made with his characters ! Ooh , a Godyssey movie ! I 'm sure I 'll see that NEVER , because not a single movie that Rob Liefeld 's characters have been developed for has actually ever been made ! And do n't bring up \" Not Deadpool \" in the Wolverine movie ! I should not have to explain that again - Deadpool 's not really his character , that was n't really Deadpool , and he was n't the main character of the damn movie !",

Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what 's going on . Now , look , we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression . And believe me : We 're in a bubble right now . And the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down . We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble . And we better be awfully careful . And we have a Fed that 's doing political things . This Janet Yellen of the Fed . The Fed is doing political - by keeping the interest rates at this level . And believe me : The day Obama goes off , and he leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen , because the Fed is not doing their job . The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump , we 're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay , yet you have not released your tax returns . And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to - who he owes it to and any business conflicts . Do n't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest ?\nHimself - Candidate: I do n't mind releasing - I 'm under a routine audit . And it 'll be released . And - as soon as the audit 's finished , it will be released . But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have . It shows income - in fact , the income - I just looked today - the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million . If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago , I would have been very surprised . But that 's the kind of thinking that our country needs . When we have a country that 's doing so badly , that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world , it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs , because everybody - Lester , we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year . You know what that is ? That means , who 's negotiating these trade deals ? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals .\nHimself - Moderator: The IRS says an audit ...\nHimself - Candidate: Excuse me .\nHimself - Moderator: ... of your taxes - you 're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit . And so the question , does the public 's right to know outweigh your personal ...\nHimself - Candidate: Well , I told you , I will release them as soon as the audit . Look , I 've been under audit almost for 15 years . I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited . I said , do you get audited ? I get audited almost every year . And in a way , I should be complaining . I 'm not even complaining . I do n't mind it . It 's almost become a way of life . I get audited by the IRS . But other people do n't . I will say this . We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of . I will release my tax returns - against my lawyer 's wishes - when she releases her 33000 e - mails that have been deleted . As soon as she releases them , I will release . I will release my tax returns . And that 's against - my lawyers , they say , \" Do n't do it . \" I will tell you this . No - in fact , watching shows , they 're reading the papers . Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete . When the audit 's complete , I 'll do it . But I would go against them if she releases her e - mails .\nHimself - Moderator: So it 's negotiable ?\nHimself - Candidate: It 's not negotiable , no . Let her release the e - mails . Why did she delete 33000 ...\nHimself - Moderator: Well , I 'll let her answer that . But let me just admonish the audience one more time . There was an agreement . We did ask you to be silent , so it would be helpful for us . Secretary Clinton ?\nHerself - Candidate: Well , I think you 've seen another example of bait - and- switch here . For 40 years , everyone running for president has released their tax returns . You can go and see nearly , I think , 39 , 40 years of our tax returns , but everyone has done it . We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you 're under audit . So you 've got to ask yourself , why wo n't he release his tax returns ? And I think there may be a couple of reasons . First , maybe he 's not as rich as he says he is . Second , maybe he 's not as charitable as he claims to be . Third , we do n't know all of his business dealings , but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks . Or maybe he does n't want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes , because the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license , and they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax .\nHimself - Candidate: That makes me smart .\nHerself - Candidate: So if he 's paid _ zero _ , that means zero for troops , zero for vets , zero for schools or health . And I think probably he 's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are , because it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide . And the financial disclosure statements , they do n't give you the tax rate . They do n't give you all the details that tax returns would . And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see . And I have no reason to believe that he 's ever going to release his tax returns , because there 's something he 's hiding . And we 'll guess . We 'll keep guessing at what it might be that he 's hiding . But I think the question is , were he ever to get near the White House , what would be those conflicts ? Who does he owe money to ? Well , he owes you the answers to that , and he should provide them .",

They built a shrine around it , and protected the orb by placing it in the mouth of a giant dragon statue , said to be its eternal guardian . You should have seen the detail on this thing . It was INCREDIBLE : scales made of ruby , teeth of pearl ... Speaking of pearl , they say there was this one native girl ...\nBulma: GET ON WITH IT !\nMaster Roshi: Yes , well ... The tribe enjoyed years of prosperity , until one day : evil paid a visit to the village in the form of a band of thieves . These agents of darkness stormed the temple in an attempt to steal the Dragon Ball for their own selfish gain . They were shocked to discover the true power of the Ball . To ensure such an attack never happened again , the Dragon Ball was divided into seven smaller orbs , and scattered across the globe . Separately , the Dragon Balls were useless , but when all _ seven _ were united , then a single voice could summon the Eternal Dragon for one wish , and one wish only . Some wishes were pure , but others were tainted by blind ambition . This led to pain and suffering , as an unjust few wished for power and dominion over mankind . But , as the story goes , there will one day come a hero who will use the Dragon Balls for goodness , and bring peace and unity to the world once more .",

You can yell until you 're blue in the face about how the concept of a proactive superhero team that has merchandising and appears on talk shows and are celebrities and crap is such a wonderful idea , and it 's just the execution that fails , but in the end , it does n't change that Youngblood sucks ! You can tell me about the runs from Alan Moore or the revived series from _ 2011 _ , and that 's great if they really are good , but it just keeps bringing me back to the question of why the hell anyone would want to do anything with this series when there is so much frigid ' baggage with it ! Look , my rant against the X - Men in my Next 15 Screw - Ups was half joking . I do n't hate the X - Men and there are plenty of bad stories out there that have nothing to do with them , and there are great runs on the X - Men books . But Youngblood is a team that does not deserve all the hard work of creators ! It 's a bunch of unmemorable ripoff characters , growling and gritting teeth , and saying really stupid things , and squinting and doing exaggerated poses and all that crap ! Let Youngblood die , already ! Just let it die ! Rob Liefeld does not deserve the amount of loyalty that he somehow has engendered ! What 's that ? Rob Liefeld is really enthusiastic about the industry and is really an awesome guy if you know him in person , and loves comics and everything about the medium ? Yeah , well , I 'm really enthusiastic about the medium , but no one says that I should be drawing comic books ! Rob Liefeld ca n't write ! Rob Liefeld ca n't draw ! Rob Liefeld ca n't create ! And do n't go telling me about how he created Deadpool and Cable ! One - he did n't create Deadpool ! He created some boring - ass mercenary who spoke in yellow - colored speech bubbles ! Nobody would give a damn about him if not for the work of everybody else but him ! And as for Cable , most of my knowledge of the character comes from the animated series , but even if Cable really is all that awesome and iconic a character , well , congratulations . You have found one , all of one character that Rob Liefeld created that 's actually good , except a good creator is capable of making more than just one good character ! Liefeld , on the other hand , settles on inventing 60000 characters , and none of them are good ! But to cite that Deadpool example again , is he really the one who created him if everything about the character that people like that was done by others ? You show me a Rob Liefeld character that people like , and I 'll show you the other creators who are responsible for you liking him . The point is , companies , stop giving him work ! Consumers , stop buying things with his name on it ! And my fans , stop telling me about movies that are supposedly being made with his characters ! Ooh , a Godyssey movie ! I 'm sure I 'll see that NEVER , because not a single movie that Rob Liefeld 's characters have been developed for has actually ever been made ! And do n't bring up \" Not Deadpool \" in the Wolverine movie ! I should not have to explain that again - Deadpool 's not really his character , that was n't really Deadpool , and he was n't the main character of the damn movie !",

Last year , we took a group of students to the National Gallery in Washington , D.C. and met the President . I think that Ruthie would make a wonderful addition to our school . If you have any questions , please call .\nRev. Eric Camden, Annie Camden: Thank you .\nMrs. Carmen Mackoul: Bye , Ruthie .\nRuthie Camden: Boy , when God answers a prayer , he answers a prayer !\nRev. Eric Camden: Does that mean you want to go to school here ?\nAnnie Camden: Oh , yeah !",

In just 48 hours , it 's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook , with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network . As we said a moment ago , we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media , and our first stays on this topic . Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook , \" Trump says the campaign has changed him . When did that happen ? \" So , Mr. Trump , let me add to that . When you walked off that bus at age 59 , were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently ? And you have two minutes for this .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: It was locker room talk , as I told you . That was locker room talk . I 'm not proud of it . I am a person who has great respect for people , for my family , for the people of this country . And certainly , I 'm not proud of it . But that was something that happened . If you look at Bill Clinton , far worse . Mine are words , and his was action . His was what he 's done to women . There 's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that 's been so abusive to women . So you can say any way you want to say it , but Bill Clinton was abusive to women . Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously . Four of them here tonight . One of the women , who is a wonderful woman , at 12 years old , was raped at 12 . Her client she represented got him off , and she 's seen laughing on two separate occasions , laughing at the girl who was raped . Kathy Shelton , that young woman is here with us tonight . So do n't tell me about words . I am absolutely - I apologize for those words . But it is things that people say . But what President Clinton did , he was impeached , he lost his license to practice law . He had to pay an $ 850000 fine to one of the women . Paula Jones , who 's also here tonight . And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago , I think it 's disgraceful , and I think she should be ashamed of herself , if you want to know the truth .\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: Can\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: we please hold the applause ? Secretary Clinton , you have two minutes .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: Well , first , let me start by saying that so much of what he 's just said is not right , but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses . He gets to decide what he wants to talk about . Instead of answering people 's questions , talking about our agenda , laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country , that 's his choice . When I hear something like that , I am reminded of what my friend , Michelle Obama , advised us all : When they go low , you go high .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: And\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: , look , if this were just about one video , maybe what he 's saying tonight would be understandable , but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women . But he never apologizes for anything to anyone . He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan , the Gold Star family whose son , Captain Khan , died in the line of duty in Iraq . And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion . He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana , but Donald said he could n't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were , quote , \" Mexican . \" He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching . And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America . He owes the president an apology , he owes our country an apology , and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Well , you owe the president an apology , because as you know very well , your campaign , Sidney Blumenthal - he 's another real winner that you have - and he 's the one that got this started , along with your campaign manager , and they were on television just two weeks ago , she was , saying exactly that . So you really owe him an apology . You 're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign , sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb . That was long before I was ever involved , so you actually owe an apology . Number two , Michelle Obama . I 've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you . And I 've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I 've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you , Hillary . So , you talk about friend ? Go back and take a look at those commercials , a race where you lost fair and square , unlike the Bernie Sanders race , where you won , but not fair and square , in my opinion . And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind , because Bernie Sanders , between super - delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz , he never had a chance . And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil . But when you talk about apology , I think the _ one _ that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 e - mails that you deleted , and that you acid washed , and then the two boxes of e - mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing . And I 'll tell you what . I did n't think I 'd say this , but I 'm going to say it , and I hate to say it . But if I win , I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation , because there has never been so many lies , so much deception . There has never been anything like it , and we 're going to have a special prosecutor . When I speak , I go out and speak , the people of this country are furious . In my opinion , the people that have been long - term workers at the FBI are furious . There has never been anything like this , where e - mails - and you get a subpoena , you get a subpoena , and after getting the subpoena , you delete 33000 e - mails , and then you acid wash them or bleach them , as you would say , very expensive process . So we 're going to get a special prosecutor , and we 're going to look into it , because you know what ? People have been - their lives have been destroyed for doing one - fifth of what you 've done . And it 's a disgrace . And honestly , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: Secretary Clinton , I want to follow up on that . I 'm going to let you talk about e - mails .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false , but I 'm not surprised .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Oh , really ?\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: In the first debate ...\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: And\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: really , the audience needs to calm down here .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: I told people that it would be impossible to be fact - checking Donald all the time . I 'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we 're going to really make lives better for people . So , once again , go to HillaryClinton.com . We have literally Trump - you can fact check him in real time . Last time at the first debate , we had millions of people fact checking , so I expect we 'll have millions more fact checking , because , you know , it is - it 's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Because you 'd be in jail .",

            "input": "Linkara:  Allow me to share a revelation I 've just had . For all of his bluster about \" with great power comes great responsibility , \" Peter Parker is one of the most irresponsible superheroes ever . He never learns from his mistakes , never takes into consideration how his life as Spider - Man affects everybody else . Now some would say that 's the core concept of the character , the constant struggle between the mask and the man . But he never actually gives any consideration to the man , preferring to make excuses about it . He disappoints people around him all the time because something more important was happening as Spider - Man . But instead of finding a way to balance his two lives properly , he will go out of his way to make excuses for it and be sad that being Spider - Man hurt his personal life . If he places more importance on being Spider - Man , then he should distance himself from relationships that would hurt that . If he places more emphasis on being Peter Parker , he needs to sacrifice his time as Spider - Man . Now that 's not always going to be the case for everyone in the real world . But Peter never actually changes as a result of his actions . He just makes the same mistakes over and over . During a story line called \" The Other \" when Peter was dying from an untraceable condition , this was also written by JMS by the way , he admits that he does n't even have life insurance . Peter has never made a plan about what would happen to his family if he were killed by a super - villain . He 's never thought about the repurcussions of his life if he should be maimed or killed while wearing the costume , to his wife or to his constantly dying aunt . In a recent issue of \" Avengers Academy , \" a group of teenage superheroes thought of several ways he could have capitalized on being Spider - Man without revealing his identity to anyone . Now admittedly , he was just a young , dumb teenager when he started out and did n't think of those things . But Peter is and has been an adult for decades now . Forget about whether you like Spidey being married or not , the character himself still seems to operate like he 's in high school , never growing up , never seems to recognize adult relationships , and never actually taking responsibility for his life and the choices he 's made . This is one of the reasons I decided to finally review One More Day . The deal with Mephisto is symptomatic of a bigger problem for the character and the people who write him . The unwillingness for the character to become an adult . He 's supposed to be roughly 25 years old at the time of this story , maybe closer to _ 30 _ . And yet he repeatedly approaches his problems like a 16-year - old would and is never actually prepared to act like a mature adult . I 've made several jokes in the last 200 episodes about how Peter Parker 's life is an endless spiral of shame and misery , what with his friends and loved ones dying all around him or becoming super - villains because of his life as Spider - Man and I mean it . The truth is that if Peter Parker actually cared about taking responsibility for his actions , he would have given up being Spider - Man a looong time ago . But hey , maybe that 's just the reasoning of a jaded individual looking at this stupid - ass comic in hindsight . Of course I do n't want Peter Parker to stop being Spider - Man . What I want is for him to be written like a goddamn adult already ! But the writers and Marvel editorial seem to steadfastly refuse to let that happen . Spider - Man is just escapist fantasy to them . The reason why they do n't think there 's drama in marriage is because marriage is an aspect of real life and they do n't want the escapism of Peter Parker swinging through the air and stopping bad guys being infected with the drama of things that people have to endure in the real world . And that 's just hilarious since Spider - Man is supposed to be the character who does face the real - life challenges of the world . That was what made his character so appealing to begin with : His ability to relate to the reader . But the truth is that the reader has grown up . The reader got married , has kids , have relatives that die and they have to move on . The reader changed but Peter Parker has not . You know there was a rumor that Marvel was doing its own reboot to compete with the one DC did last year . They 're not of course . They 're just releasing a whole bunch of new number ones , but you know what ? Maybe they should reboot Spider - Man . After all , if the creative teams are unwilling to let him get out of his high school life , then why the hell is n't he still there ?",

            "input": "Herself - Candidate:  Well , let 's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago . We had the worst financial crisis , the Great Recession , the worst since the 1930s . That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy , failed to invest in the middle class , took their eyes off of Wall Street , and created a perfect storm . In fact , Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis . He said , back in _ 2006 _ , \" Gee , I hope it does collapse , because then I can go in and buy some and make some money . \" Well , it did collapse .\nHimself - Candidate: That 's called business , by the way .\nHerself - Candidate: Nine million people - nine million people lost their jobs . Five million people lost their homes . And $ 13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out . Now , we have come back from that abyss . And it has not been easy . So we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy , but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place . Independent experts have looked at what I 've proposed and looked at what Donald 's proposed , and basically they 've said this , that if his tax plan , which would blow up the debt by over $ 5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle - class families compared to the wealthy , were to go into effect , we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession . They 've looked at my plans and they 've said , OK , if we can do this , and I intend to get it done , we will have 10 million more new jobs , because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy . Take clean energy . Some country is going to be the clean - energy superpower of the 21st century . Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese . I think it 's real .\nHimself - Candidate: I did not . I did not . I do not say that .\nHerself - Candidate: I think science is real .\nHimself - Candidate: I do not say that .\nHerself - Candidate: And I think it 's important that we grip this and deal with it , both at home and abroad . And here 's what we can do . We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels . We can have enough clean energy to power every home . We can build a new modern electric grid . That 's a lot of jobs ; that 's a lot of new economic activity . So I 've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do , and I am determined that we 're going to get the economy really moving again , building on the progress we 've made over the last eight years , but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump ?\nHimself - Candidate: She talks about solar panels . We invested in a solar company , our country . That was a disaster . They lost plenty of money on that one . Now , look , I 'm a great believer in all forms of energy , but we 're putting a lot of people out of work . Our energy policies are a disaster . Our country is losing so much in terms of energy , in terms of paying off our debt . You ca n't do what you 're looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt . The Obama administration , from the time they 've come in , is over 230 years ' worth of debt , and he 's topped it . He 's doubled it in a course of almost eight years , seven - and - a - half years , to be semi- exact . So I will tell you this . We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs . And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand , because they 're not doing it . And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving , they 're gone . And , Hillary , I 'd just ask you this . You 've been doing this for 30 years . Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now ? For 30 years , you 've been doing it , and now you 're just starting to think of solutions .\nHerself - Candidate: Well , actually ...\nHimself - Candidate: I will bring - excuse me . I will bring back jobs . You ca n't bring back jobs .\nHerself - Candidate: Well , actually , I have thought about this quite a bit .\nHimself - Candidate: Yeah , for 30 years .",

He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...\nBoomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .\nWizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .\nBoomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .\nWizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .\nBoomstick: At _ fifteen _ , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !\nVegeta: It 's over 9000 !\nBoomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .\nWizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was 8000 . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...\nBoomstick: Dai - what now ?\nWizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .\nBoomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .\nWizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .\nBoomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !\nWizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...\nBoomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .\nWizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .\nBoomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the one and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .\nWizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .\nBoomstick: Which is light speed !\nGoku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .\nWizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , \" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . \" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .\nBoomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?\nWizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .\nBoomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .",

            "input": "Wizard:  Kakarot was born to a low - class Saiyan warrior on the planet Vegeta . He narrowly escaped the extinction of his entire race when he was sent to Earth with a single , simple mission ...\nBoomstick: Destroy everything ! Then he conveniently bumped his head and forgot about it all .\nWizard: Dubbed Goku by his adopted grandfather , his life revolves around combat . He cares little for anything else , unless food is involved .\nBoomstick: At 12 years old , he was trained by Master Roshi in Kame - Sennin Ryu , which pushes a person to superhuman levels .\nWizard: Complementing his Saiyan biology , Goku 's superhuman strength , speed and senses skyrocketed . He developed numerous fighting techniques including the fast - moving After - Image and the Dragonthrow , his trademark grapple .\nBoomstick: At fifteen , he was already so powerful that the only worthy teachers left were gods ... and a talking cat , but mostly GODS ! He was only a kid and already , his power level was already enormous !\nVegeta: It 's over 9000 !\nBoomstick: Not yet ! Okay , now it is .\nWizard: FALSE ! In the Japanese manga , Goku 's power level at that time was 8000 . But it does n't even matter because power levels are absurd . The entire point of introducing them was to show how unreliable and meaningless they were . By relying on power levels , the villains constantly underestimated the heroes . Therefore , using them to judge Goku 's abilities is pointless . Besides , the Daizenshuu says that ...\nBoomstick: Dai - what now ?\nWizard: The Official Dragonball Encyclopedia . It states power levels eventually become immeasurable , not because they are so high they ca n't be measured , but because the characters , and hopefully the audience , have realized just how futile these numbers are . We can not judge Goku by his power level , nor can we through power scaling , the theory that he can achieve the same feats as lesser Dragonball characters . Goku 's abilities are tailored to his personal training and experiences , not to mention anatomy .\nBoomstick: However , Goku does have a knack for mimicking ki techniques .\nWizard: Ki is metaphysical , made up of things such as vigor , courage and being in one 's true mind .\nBoomstick: It 's basically a kind of natural life force energy and is a fundamental component of Daoist medicine and martial arts . Oh , and uh , it 's NOT magic !\nWizard: Dragonball creates a very distinct difference between ki and magic . Ki is dependent on the physical ability of the user and magic - users like Babidi are clearly using something different . Goku harnesses and manipulates his ki energy ...\nBoomstick: Into badass lasers and stuff , like ki blasts , energy barriers and the Destructo Disc , which he totally stole from Krillin . The Solar Flare blinds opponents and the Spirit Bomb puts energy from other things into a giant death ball ... that takes freaking forever to make .\nWizard: And energy taken from sentient beings must be voluntary . The Spirit Bomb is fueled by positive energy which is only effective against those filled with negative energy , AKA evil . In the Super Android 13 film , Goku actually absorbs the ki gathered from the Spirit Bomb , becoming one with it , transforming and manipulating the energy himself .\nBoomstick: But his two best moves are the Dragon Fist , where he super - charges his punch with a golden ki dragon and the _ one _ and only Kamehameha : a giant focused beam which every kid in the world has always wanted to do . Do n't lie , you 've tried it .\nWizard: Goku also uses ki for telekinesis and high - speed flight . He can even sense the power and location of other ki sources and then teleport directly to them with Instant Transmission .\nBoomstick: Which is light speed !\nGoku: You dematerialize and travel as a mass of light .\nWizard: Again , FALSE ! This is another mistake in translation . According to the original manga , \" Instant Transmission is ... well ... instant . \" Its only flaw is that it requires concentrated focus . Also , he can read minds .\nBoomstick: Wait , what ? Is there no limit to this ki thing ?\nWizard: There is . Goku draws from a finite pool of ki energy . So to increase his power , Goku perfected the art of Kaio - Ken . This amplifies Goku 's ki , multiplying his strength , speed , defense and so on .\nBoomstick: Only one problem : it puts a giant strain on body and can even kill him .",

That 's our story now . It 's called \" The Coyote Who Was n't , \" and , as you can guess , it 's about a coyote who was n't quite a coyote . Or maybe we should say , about _ one _ who was more than a coyote . Now , you know , the coyote is a very clever animal . And , generally speaking , people tend to underestimate him . That 's because they do n't really know him . The fact that he 's still around , when a lot of other creatures have become extinct , speaks for his ability to adapt to new situations and to get along with man . In some ways , he 's very much like his cousin , the dog : he 's smart , he has ability to learn and , when treated with kindness , he can show a certain kind of loyalty .

Just asked for the chance to say goodbye to his family . By the time he was done , even the soldiers did n't wanna kill him . So they went to their commander and asked permission to shoot him . At least give him a quick death . The commander wanted to meet this man who had won the respect of so many . He went to Gahiji ... talked with him in his hut , for many hours . Then he dragged him out in front of his village and hacked him to pieces ... along with his entire family . In that man who took Gahiji 's life ... I saw the Devil . So yes , Matthew ...

We 're born like that . We like naked women as soon as we 're pulled out of _ one _ . Halfway down the birth canal we 're already enjoying the view . Look , it 's the four pillars of the male heterosexual psyche . We like : naked women , stockings , lesbians , and Sean Connery best as James Bond . Because that is what being a bloke is . And if you do n't like it , darling , join a film collective . I want to spend the rest of my life with the woman at the end of the table here . But that does not stop me wanting to see several thousand more naked bottoms before I die . Because that 's what being a bloke is . When Man invented fire , he did n't say \" Hey , let 's cook ! \" He said : \" Great ! Now we can see naked bottoms in the dark ! \" As soon as Caxton invented the printing press we were using it to make pictures of - hey ! - naked bottoms . We 've turned the Internet into an enormous international database of ... naked bottoms . So , you see , the story of male achievement through the ages , feeble though it may have been , has been the story of our struggle to get a better look at your bottoms . Frankly , girls , I 'm not so sure how insulted you really ought to be .",

I believe that any system which produces that result violates my basic rights as a citizen and is inconsistent with the laws of the United States . It is my desire to play baseball in 1970 , and I am capable of playing . I have received a contract from the Philadelphia club , but I believe I have the right to consider offers from other clubs before making any decisions . I therefore request that you make known to all Major League clubs my feelings in this matter , and advise them of my availability for the 1970 season . Sincerely , Curt Flood . \"\nNarrator: The commissioner refused to exempt him from the reserve clause . Flood refused to play , and vowed to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court .

Then why the attachment to such a world ? And this ... is the seed of Rudraksha . Seeds never wither . They never die . They give life . Like the soul . So that we never lose sight of the truth ... that 's why we wear a garland of Rudraksha beads . This is the mark of the devotees of Shiva .\nDevi Sati (2011-): Shiva ?\nSage: Yes , my lady ...

He lives alone , in a large residence . There 's enough space and ventilation to accommodate an embalming suite .\nAaron Hotchner: He 's awkward with people , especially women . An inability to relate socially is common in homicidal necrophiles .\nDerek Morgan: Because of the alterations to the bodies , we believe the unsub is attempting to recreate a woman he once loved .\nDetective Duran: Like a girlfriend ?\nAaron Hotchner: Or a wife , a mother . Someone who left or died suddenly .\nDr. Spencer Reid: This projection of the loved one coupled with his need to preserve the victims through embalming is similar to the psychopathology of serial murderer Ed Gein . Gein had an Oedipal complex which developed in the years he nursed his paralyzed mother back from a stroke . After she died , his obsession compelled him to dig up corpses of women who resembled his mother . So persistent was his desire to resurrect his dead mother that he actually dressed in female suits fashioned from human skin . Eventually , Gein grew unhappy with the flesh of dead bodies , which had a tendency to dry and crack , so he shifted his focus to live victims , whose bodies he could better preserve .\nAaron Hotchner: The evolution from dead to live victims will also be mirrored in our unsub 's maturation .\nEmily Prentiss: We 've put together a list of incident reports prior to _ 2006 _ .

In just 48 hours , it 's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook , with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network . As we said a moment ago , we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media , and our first stays on this topic . Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook , \" Trump says the campaign has changed him . When did that happen ? \" So , Mr. Trump , let me add to that . When you walked off that bus at age 59 , were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently ? And you have two minutes for this .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: It was locker room talk , as I told you . That was locker room talk . I 'm not proud of it . I am a person who has great respect for people , for my family , for the people of this country . And certainly , I 'm not proud of it . But that was something that happened . If you look at Bill Clinton , far worse . Mine are words , and his was action . His was what he 's done to women . There 's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that 's been so abusive to women . So you can say any way you want to say it , but Bill Clinton was abusive to women . Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously . Four of them here tonight . One of the women , who is a wonderful woman , at 12 years old , was raped at _ 12 _ . Her client she represented got him off , and she 's seen laughing on two separate occasions , laughing at the girl who was raped . Kathy Shelton , that young woman is here with us tonight . So do n't tell me about words . I am absolutely - I apologize for those words . But it is things that people say . But what President Clinton did , he was impeached , he lost his license to practice law . He had to pay an $ 850000 fine to one of the women . Paula Jones , who 's also here tonight . And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago , I think it 's disgraceful , and I think she should be ashamed of herself , if you want to know the truth .\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: Can\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: we please hold the applause ? Secretary Clinton , you have two minutes .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: Well , first , let me start by saying that so much of what he 's just said is not right , but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses . He gets to decide what he wants to talk about . Instead of answering people 's questions , talking about our agenda , laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country , that 's his choice . When I hear something like that , I am reminded of what my friend , Michelle Obama , advised us all : When they go low , you go high .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: And\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: , look , if this were just about one video , maybe what he 's saying tonight would be understandable , but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women . But he never apologizes for anything to anyone . He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan , the Gold Star family whose son , Captain Khan , died in the line of duty in Iraq . And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion . He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana , but Donald said he could n't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were , quote , \" Mexican . \" He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching . And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America . He owes the president an apology , he owes our country an apology , and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Well , you owe the president an apology , because as you know very well , your campaign , Sidney Blumenthal - he 's another real winner that you have - and he 's the one that got this started , along with your campaign manager , and they were on television just two weeks ago , she was , saying exactly that . So you really owe him an apology . You 're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign , sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb . That was long before I was ever involved , so you actually owe an apology . Number two , Michelle Obama . I 've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you . And I 've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I 've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you , Hillary . So , you talk about friend ? Go back and take a look at those commercials , a race where you lost fair and square , unlike the Bernie Sanders race , where you won , but not fair and square , in my opinion . And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind , because Bernie Sanders , between super - delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz , he never had a chance . And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil . But when you talk about apology , I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 e - mails that you deleted , and that you acid washed , and then the two boxes of e - mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing . And I 'll tell you what . I did n't think I 'd say this , but I 'm going to say it , and I hate to say it . But if I win , I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation , because there has never been so many lies , so much deception . There has never been anything like it , and we 're going to have a special prosecutor . When I speak , I go out and speak , the people of this country are furious . In my opinion , the people that have been long - term workers at the FBI are furious . There has never been anything like this , where e - mails - and you get a subpoena , you get a subpoena , and after getting the subpoena , you delete 33000 e - mails , and then you acid wash them or bleach them , as you would say , very expensive process . So we 're going to get a special prosecutor , and we 're going to look into it , because you know what ? People have been - their lives have been destroyed for doing one - fifth of what you 've done . And it 's a disgrace . And honestly , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: Secretary Clinton , I want to follow up on that . I 'm going to let you talk about e - mails .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false , but I 'm not surprised .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Oh , really ?\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: In the first debate ...\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: And\nMartha Raddatz - Moderator: really , the audience needs to calm down here .\nHillary Clinton - Candidate: I told people that it would be impossible to be fact - checking Donald all the time . I 'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we 're going to really make lives better for people . So , once again , go to HillaryClinton.com . We have literally Trump - you can fact check him in real time . Last time at the first debate , we had millions of people fact checking , so I expect we 'll have millions more fact checking , because , you know , it is - it 's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country .\nDonald Trump - Candidate: Because you 'd be in jail .",

It travels 60 feet 6 inches from the pitcher 's mound to home - and it can cover that distance at nearly 100 miles an hour . Along the way it can be made to twist , spin , curve , wobble , rise , or fall away . The bat is made of turned ash , less than 42 inches long , not more than 2 3/4 inches in diameter . The batter has only a few thousandths of a second to decide to hit the ball . And yet the men who fail seven times out of ten are considered the game 's greatest heroes . It is played everywhere . In parks and playground and prison yards . In back alleys and farmers fields . By small children and by old men . By raw amateurs and millionare professionals . It is a leisurely game that demands blinding speed . The only game where the defense has the ball . It follows the seasons , beginning each year with the fond expectancy of springtime and ending with the hard facts of autumn . Americans have played baseball for more than 200 years , while they conquered a continent , warred with _ one _ another and with enemies abroad , struggled over labor and civil rights and the meaning of freedom . At the games 's heart lie mythic contradictions : a pastoral game , born in crowded cities ; an exhilarating democratic sport that tolerates cheating and has excluded as many as it has included ; a profoundly conservative game that sometimes manages to be years ahead of its time . It is an American odyssey that links sons and daughters to father and grandfathers . And it reflects a host of age - old American tensions : between workers and owners , scandal and reform , the individual and the collective . It is a haunted game , where each player is measured by the ghosts of those who have gone before .

Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what 's going on . Now , look , we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression . And believe me : We 're in a bubble right now . And the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down . We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble . And we better be awfully careful . And we have a Fed that 's doing political things . This Janet Yellen of the Fed . The Fed is doing political - by keeping the interest rates at this level . And believe me : The day Obama goes off , and he leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen , because the Fed is not doing their job . The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton .\nHimself - Moderator: Mr. Trump , we 're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay , yet you have not released your tax returns . And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to - who he owes it to and any business conflicts . Do n't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest ?\nHimself - Candidate: I do n't mind releasing - I 'm under a routine audit . And it 'll be released . And - as soon as the audit 's finished , it will be released . But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have . It shows income - in fact , the income - I just looked today - the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million . If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago , I would have been very surprised . But that 's the kind of thinking that our country needs . When we have a country that 's doing so badly , that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world , it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs , because everybody - Lester , we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year . You know what that is ? That means , who 's negotiating these trade deals ? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals .\nHimself - Moderator: The IRS says an audit ...\nHimself - Candidate: Excuse me .\nHimself - Moderator: ... of your taxes - you 're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit . And so the question , does the public 's right to know outweigh your personal ...\nHimself - Candidate: Well , I told you , I will release them as soon as the audit . Look , I 've been under audit almost for 15 years . I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited . I said , do you get audited ? I get audited almost every year . And in a way , I should be complaining . I 'm not even complaining . I do n't mind it . It 's almost become a way of life . I get audited by the IRS . But other people do n't . I will say this . We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of . I will release my tax returns - against my lawyer 's wishes - when she releases her 33000 e - mails that have been deleted . As soon as she releases them , I will release . I will release my tax returns . And that 's against - my lawyers , they say , \" Do n't do it . \" I will tell you this . No - in fact , watching shows , they 're reading the papers . Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete . When the audit 's complete , I 'll do it . But I would go against them if she releases her e - mails .\nHimself - Moderator: So it 's negotiable ?\nHimself - Candidate: It 's not negotiable , no . Let her release the e - mails . Why did she delete 33000 ...\nHimself - Moderator: Well , I 'll let her answer that . But let me just admonish the audience one more time . There was an agreement . We did ask you to be silent , so it would be helpful for us . Secretary Clinton ?\nHerself - Candidate: Well , I think you 've seen another example of bait - and- switch here . For 40 years , everyone running for president has released their tax returns . You can go and see nearly , I think , _ 39 _ , 40 years of our tax returns , but everyone has done it . We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you 're under audit . So you 've got to ask yourself , why wo n't he release his tax returns ? And I think there may be a couple of reasons . First , maybe he 's not as rich as he says he is . Second , maybe he 's not as charitable as he claims to be . Third , we do n't know all of his business dealings , but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks . Or maybe he does n't want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes , because the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license , and they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax .\nHimself - Candidate: That makes me smart .\nHerself - Candidate: So if he 's paid zero , that means zero for troops , zero for vets , zero for schools or health . And I think probably he 's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are , because it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide . And the financial disclosure statements , they do n't give you the tax rate . They do n't give you all the details that tax returns would . And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see . And I have no reason to believe that he 's ever going to release his tax returns , because there 's something he 's hiding . And we 'll guess . We 'll keep guessing at what it might be that he 's hiding . But I think the question is , were he ever to get near the White House , what would be those conflicts ? Who does he owe money to ? Well , he owes you the answers to that , and he should provide them .",

He harbors envy of and hatred toward people of a higher social class . He feels invisible around them .\nDr. Spencer Reid: Uh , class is the theme of the poem which he left at the various crime scenes . At one point in the poem , the woman attempts to bribe Death , but he does n't accept it . He says this is the one moment when riches mean nothing .

Why he needed to make sure all his crimes were counted . His victims , they represent whatever it is that 's controlling him , and he wants that control back . He is under the thumb of a powerful woman who frightens him .

He is not the Tommy Killer .\nAaron \"Hotch\" Hotchner: Mrs. Gordon 's husband came home at the same time that he always does .

If you 're not leaving any witnesses , why wear a ski mask ?\nDerek Morgan: And he wants the victims to see him anyway .\nAaron \"Hotch\" Hotchner: Your attempted rapist is a garden - variety , disorganized young man .\nElle Greenaway: As the victim 's age goes up , generally the attacker 's age goes down .
