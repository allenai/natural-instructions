The Wizard can select one of several predefined messages to send, or type their own message if needed. Free text messages do not change the dialogue state in the FSM, so it is important to minimise their use by providing enough dialogue options to the Wizard. Predefined messages can also trigger other associated events such as pop-ups or follow-up non-verbal actions.\n\nNon-verbal actions, such as commands to trigger events. These can take any form, but we used buttons to control robots in our data collection.\n\nSubmitting an action would change the dialogue state in the FSM, altering the set of actions available in the subsequent turn visible to the Wizard.

For simplicity, only the first 22000 words are used in all embeddings, though preliminary results indicate the findings extend to the full corpus. For our novel methods of mitigating bias, a shallow neural network is used to adjust the embedding. The single layer of the model is an embedding layer with weights initialized to those of the original embedding. For the composite method, these weights are initialized to those of the embedding after probabilistic bias mitigation. A batch of word indices is fed into the model, which are then embedded and for which a loss value is calculated, allowing back-propagation to adjust the embeddings. For each of the models, a fixed number of iterations is used to prevent overfitting, which can eventually hurt performance on the embedding benchmarks (See Figure FIGREF12). We evaluated the embedding after 1000 iterations, and stopped training if performance on a benchmark decreased significantly. We construct a list of candidate words to debias, taken from the words used in the WEAT gender bias statistics. Words in this list should be gender neutral, and are related to the topics of career, arts, science, math, family and professions (see appendix). We note that this list can easily be expanded to include a greater proportion of words in the corpus. For example, BIBREF4 suggested a method for identifying inappropriately gendered words using unsupervised learning. We compare this method of bias mitigation with the no bias mitigation (\"Orig\"), geometric bias mitigation (\"Geo\"), the two pieces of our method alone (\"Prob\" and \"KNN\") and the composite method (\"KNN+Prob\"). We note that the composite method performs reasonably well according the the RIPA metric, and much better than traditional geometric bias mitigation according to the neighborhood metric, without significant performance loss according to the accepted benchmarks. To our knowledge this is the first bias mitigation method to perform reasonably both on both metrics.",

Methods ::: Evaluation ::: Words co-occurrences\nA matrix of words co-occurrence was constructed on the total corpus from PubMed. Briefly, each document was lowered and tokenized. A matrix was filled with the number of times that two words co-occur in a single document. Then, for 5,000 documents $D_{x}$ from the TeS, all models were queried for the top-close document $C_{x}$. All possible combinations between all words $WD_{x} \\in D_{x}$ and all words $WC_{x} \\in C_{x}$ (excluding stopwords) were extracted, 500 couples were randomly selected and the number of times each of them was co-occurring was extracted from the matrix. The average value of this list was calculated, reflecting the proximity between D and C regarding their words content. This score was also calculated between each $D_{x}$ and the top-close document $C_{x}$ returned by the pmra algorithm. Methods ::: Evaluation ::: Stems co-occurrences\nThe evaluation task explained above was also applied on 10,000 stemmed texts (using the Gensim\u2019s PorterStemmer to only keep word\u2019s roots). The influence of the conjugation form or other suffixes can be assessed. Methods ::: Evaluation ::: MeSH similarity\nIt is possible to compare the ability of both pmra and D2V to bring closer articles which were indexed with common labels. To do so, 5,000 documents $D_{x}$ randomly selected from the TeS were sent to both pmra and D2V architectures, and the top-five closer articles $C_{x}$ were extracted. The following rules were then applied to each MeSH found associated with $D_{x}$ for each document $C_{x_i}$ : add 1 to the score if this MeSH term is found in both $D_{x}$ and $C_{x_i}$, add 3 if this MeSH is defined as major topic and add 1 for each qualifier in common between $D_{x}$ and Cxi regarding this particular MeSH term.

Then, we employ a bi-linear attention network to calculate the opinion summary as the weighted sum of the new opinion representations, according to their associations with the current aspect representation.

The automatic score roughly followed the design in BIBREF13. The pitch tracker of librosa package BIBREF18 was employed to extract pitch information of the input and output audio. Then the output pitch was compared to the input pitch using the normalized cross correlation (NCC) which would give a score between 0 and 1. The higher the score is, the better the output pitch matches the input pitch. We conducted the evaluation on USVC (our) and PitchNet. The evaluated automatic scores on conversion and reconstruction tasks are shown in Tab. TABREF14. Our method performed better both on conversion and reconstruction. The scores of reconstruction are higher than conversion since both models were trained using a reconstruction loss. However, the score of our method on conversion is even higher than the score of USVC (Our) on reconstruction. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was used as a subjective metric to evaluate the quality of the converted audio. Two questions were asked: (1) what is quality of the audio? (naturalness) (2) How well does the converted version match the original? (similarity) A score of 1-5 would be given to answer the questions. The evaluation was conducted on USVC (Our) and PitchNet. Besides, the converted samples provided by BIBREF0 was also included to give a more convincing evaluation. As shown by Tab. TABREF15, the naturalness and similarity of our method are both higher than the other two ones. Our implementation of USVC performed slightly lower than the original author's because we cannot fully reproduce the results of them. Next we qualitatively analyze the influence of input pitch in our method. We used different pitch as input to observe how the output pitch would change along with the input pitch. The input pitch was multiplied by 0.7, 1.0 and 1.3 respectively. And the output pitch was also extracted by the pitch tracker of the librosa package. Fig. FIGREF16 plots the pitch of input audio and output audio with different pitch as input while keeping the target singer the same.

Even though a word may be a polysemic, it usually corresponds to a single vector in distributed representation. This vector is primarily determined by the major sense, which is most frequently used. The information about a word's minor sense is subtle, and the effect of a minor sense is difficult to distinguish from statistical fluctuation. To measure the effect of a minor sense, this paper proposes to use the concept of surrounding uniformity. The surrounding uniformity roughly corresponds to statistical fluctuation in the vectors that correspond to the words in the neighbor Surrounding Uniformity (SU) can be expressed as follows: $SU(\\vec{w}) = \\frac{|\\vec{s}(\\vec{w})|}{|\\vec{w}| + \\sum _{i}^{N}|\\vec{a_i}(\\vec{w})|}$\n\nwhere $\\vec{s}(\\vec{w}) = \\vec{w} + \\sum _{i}^{N} \\vec{a_i}(\\vec{w}).$",

This indicates that effective collaboration and information ease are key to task completion in this setting.\n\nRegarding the qualitative data, one of the objectives of the Wizard-of-Oz technique was to make the participant believe that they are interacting with an automated agent and the qualitative feedback seemed to reflect this: \u201cThe AI in the game was not helpful at all [...]\u201d or \u201cI was talking to Fred a bot assistant, I had no other partner in the game\u201c.\n\nData Analysis ::: Single vs Multiple Wizards\nIn Table TABREF28, we compare various metrics from the dialogues collected with crowdsourcing with the dialogues previously collected in a lab environment for a similar task. Most figures are comparable, except the number of emergency assistant turns (and consequently the total number of turns). To further understand these differences, we have first grouped the dialogue acts in four different broader types: Updates, Actions, Interactions and Requests, and computed the relative frequency of each of these types in both data collections. In addition, Figures FIGREF29 and FIGREF30 show the distribution of the most frequent dialogue acts in the different settings. It is visible that in the lab setting where the interaction was face-to-face with a robot, the Wizard used more Interaction dialogue acts (Table TABREF32). These were often used in context where the Wizard needed to hold the turn while looking for the appropriate prompt or waiting for the robot to arrive at the specified goal in the environment. On the other hand, in the crowdsourced data collection utterances, the situation updates were a more common choice while the assistant was waiting for the robot to travel to the specified goal in the environment.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the data shows a medium strong positive correlation between task success and the number of Action type dialogue acts the Wizard performs, triggering events in the world leading to success ($R=0.475$). There is also a positive correlation between task success and the number of Request dialogue acts requesting confirmation before actions ($R=0.421$), e.g., \u201cWhich robot do you want to send?\u201d. As Table 3 shows, these are relatively rare but perhaps reflect a level of collaboration needed to further the task to completion. Table TABREF40 shows one of the dialogues collected where the Emergency Assistant continuously engaged with the Operator through these types of dialogue acts.\n\nThe task success rate was also very different between the two set-ups. In experiments reported in BIBREF4, 96% of the dialogues led to the extinction of the fire whereas in the crowdsourcing setting only 9.66% achieved the same goal. In the crowdsourced setting, the robots were slower moving at realistic speeds unlike the lab setting. A higher bonus and more time for the task might lead to a higher task success rate.\n\nData Analysis ::: Limitations\nIt is important to consider the number of available participants ready and willing to perform the task at any one time. This type of crowdsourcing requires two participants to connect within a few minutes of each other to be partnered together. As mentioned above, there were some issues with participants not collaborating and these dialogues had to be discarded as they were not of use.",

The BLEU metric can be used to evaluate dialogue generation models as in BIBREF5, BIBREF35. The BLEU metric is a word-overlap metric which computes the co-occurrence of N-grams in the reference and the generated response and also applies the brevity penalty which tries to penalize far too short responses which are usually not desired in task-oriented chatbots. We compute the BLEU score using all generated responses of our systems.\n\nPer-turn Accuracy: Per-turn accuracy measures the similarity of the system generated response versus the target response. Eric and Manning eric2017copy used this metric to evaluate their systems in which they considered their response to be correct if all tokens in the system generated response matched the corresponding token in the target response. This metric is a little bit harsh, and the results may be low since all the tokens in the generated response have to be exactly in the same position as in the target response.\n\nPer-Dialogue Accuracy: We calculate per-dialogue accuracy as used in BIBREF8, BIBREF5. For this metric, we consider all the system generated responses and compare them to the target responses. A dialogue is considered to be true if all the turns in the system generated responses match the corresponding turns in the target responses. Note that this is a very strict metric in which all the utterances in the dialogue should be the same as the target and in the right order.\n\nF1-Entity Score: Datasets used in task-oriented chores have a set of entities which represent user preferences. For example, in the restaurant domain chatbots common entities are meal, restaurant name, date, time and the number of people (these are usually the required entities which are crucial for making reservations, but there could be optional entities such as location or rating). Each target response has a set of entities which the system asks or informs the user about. Our models have to be able to discern these specific entities and inject them into the generated response. To evaluate our models we could use named-entity recognition evaluation metrics BIBREF36. The F1 score is the most commonly used metric used for the evaluation of named-entity recognition models which is the harmonic average of precision and recall of the model. We calculate this metric by micro-averaging over all the system generated responses.",

For example, rather than simply reporting the sum, we can inject noise from a Laplace or gaussian distribution, producing a result that\u2019s not quite exact, that masks the contents of any given row.  It intuitively requires that the mechanism that outputs information about an underlying dataset is robust to one sample's any change, thus protecting privacy.

In order to get balanced classes (April 5th, 2019-May 5th, 2019), we retained data collected in a longer period w.r.t to mainstream news. In both cases we filtered out articles with less than 50 tweets; overall this dataset contains $\\sim $160k mainstream tweets, corresponding to 227 news articles, and $\\sim $100k disinformation tweets, corresponding to 237 news articles.

BIBREF0 suggested that a good way to perform high-quality search is to only consider the verbs, the nouns and the adjectives in the claim; thus, we exclude all words in the claim that belong to other parts of speech. Moreover, claims often contain named entities (e.g., names of persons, locations, and organizations); hence, we augment the initial query with all the named entities from the claim's text. We use IBM's AlchemyAPI to identify named entities. Ultimately, we generate queries of 5\u201310 tokens, which we execute against a search engine.

Therefore, we construct the new input INLINEFORM0 to each LSTM unit by concatenating the original word embedding and the attention vector in Equation EQREF21 to distribute the senti-emoji information to each step. This model is called Multi-level Attention-based LSTM with Bi-sense Emoji Embedding (MATT-BiE-LSTM) Attention-based LSTM with emojis:We also use the word-emoji embedding to calculate the emoji-word attention following Equation EQREF20 and EQREF21 , and the only difference is that we replace the attention-derived senti-emoji embedding with the pre-trained word-emoji embedding by fasttext, denoted as ATT-E-LSTM. In Figure FIGREF27 (a), the ATT-E-LSTM model (baseline) assigns relatively more weights on the word \u201cno\u201d and \u201cpressure\u201d, while MATT-BiE-LSTM attends mostly on the word \u201chappy\u201d and \u201clovely\u201d. The different attention distributions suggest that the proposed senti-emoji embedding is capable of recognizing words with strong sentiments that are closely related to the true sentiment even with the presence of words with conflicting sentiments, such as \u201cpressure\u201d and \u201chappy\u201d. while ATT-E-LSTM tends to pick up all sentimental words which could raise confusions. The senti-emoji embedding is capable of extracting representations of complexed semantics and sentiments which help guide the attentions even in cases when the word sentiment and emoji sentiment are somewhat contradictory to each other. From Figure FIGREF27 (b) and (c) we can observe that the ATT-E-LSTM assigns more weights on the sentiment-irrelevant words than the MATT-BiE-LSTM such as \u201choodies\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d, indicating that the proposed model is more robust to irrelevant words and concentrates better on important words. Because of the senti-emoji embedding obtained through bi-sense emoji embedding and the sentence-level LSTM encoding on the text input (described in Section SECREF13 ), we are able to construct a more robust embedding based on the semantic and sentiment information from the whole context compared to the word-emoji embedding used in ATT-E-LSTM which takes only word-level information into account.",

The second method is to use sentence embeddings, BERT. It is used to a generate single 786-dimensional sentence embedding from 10k-dimensional one-hot vector or distribution over previous words and then merge into a single context vector with two different merging methods. Using this approach, we can obtain a more dense, informative, fixed-length vectors to encode conversational-context information, $e^k_{context}$ to be used in next $k$ -th utterance prediction. We use contextual gating mechanism in our decoder network to combine the conversational-context embeddings with speech and word embeddings effectively. Our gating is contextual in the sense that multiple embeddings compute a gate value that is dependent on the context of multiple utterances that occur in a conversation.  Let $e_w = e_w(y_{u-1})$ be our previous word embedding for a word $y_{u-1}$ , and let $e_s = e_s(x^k_{1:T})$ be a speech embedding for the acoustic features of current $k$ -th utterance $x^k_{1:T}$ and $e_c = e_c(s_{k-1-n:k-1})$ be our conversational-context embedding for $n$ -number of preceding utterances ${s_{k-1-n:k-1}}$ .

The output of the decoder $h$ is then combined with conversational-context embedding $e_c$ again with a gating mechanism,\n\n$$g = \\sigma (e_C, h) \\\\ \\hat{h} = g \\odot (e_c, h)$$ (Eq. 17)\n\nThen the next hidden layer takes these gated activations, $\\hat{h}$ , and so on.",

            "input": "Dataset Probes and Construction\nOur probing methodology starts by constructing challenge datasets (Figure FIGREF1, yellow box) from a target set of knowledge resources. Each of our probing datasets consists of multiple-choice questions that include a question $\\textbf {q}$ and a set of answer choices or candidates $\\lbrace a_{1},...a_{N}\\rbrace $. This section describes in detail the 5 different datasets we build, which are drawn from two sources of expert knowledge, namely WordNet BIBREF35 and the GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English (GCIDE). We describe each resource in turn, and explain how the resulting dataset probes, which we call WordNetQA and DictionaryQA, are constructed.\n\nFor convenience, we will describe each source of expert knowledge as a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. The nodes of this graph are $\\mathcal {V} = \\mathcal {C} \\cup \\mathcal {W} \\cup \\mathcal {S} \\cup \\mathcal {D}$, where $\\mathcal {C}$ is a set of atomic concepts, $\\mathcal {W}$ a set of words, $\\mathcal {S}$ a set of sentences, and $\\mathcal {D}$ a set of definitions (see Table TABREF4 for details for WordNet and GCIDE). Each edge of $G$ is directed from an atomic concept in $\\mathcal {C}$ to another node in $V$, and is labeled with a relation, such as hypernym or isa$^\\uparrow $, from a set of relations $\\mathcal {R}$ (see Table TABREF4).\n\nWhen defining our probe question templates, it will be useful to view $G$ as a set of (relation, source, target) triples $\\mathcal {T} \\subseteq \\mathcal {R} \\times \\mathcal {C} \\times \\mathcal {V}$. Due to their origin in an expert knowledge source, such triples preserve semantic consistency. For instance, when the relation in a triple is def, the corresponding edge maps a concept in $\\mathcal {C}$ to a definition in $\\mathcal {D}$.\n\nTo construct probe datasets, we rely on two heuristic functions, defined below for each individual probe: $\\textsc {gen}_{\\mathcal {Q}}(\\tau )$, which generates gold question-answer pairs $(\\textbf {q},\\textbf {a})$ from a set of triples $\\tau \\subseteq \\mathcal {T}$ and question templates $\\mathcal {Q}$, and $\\textsc {distr}(\\tau ^{\\prime })$, which generates distractor answers choices $\\lbrace a^{\\prime }_{1},...a^{\\prime }_{N-1} \\rbrace $ based on another set of triples $\\tau ^{\\prime }$ (where usually $\\tau \\subset \\tau ^{\\prime }$). For brevity, we will use $\\textsc {gen}(\\tau )$ to denote $\\textsc {gen}_{\\mathcal {Q}}(\\tau )$, leaving question templates $\\mathcal {Q}$ implicit.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA\nWordNet is an English lexical database consisting of around 117k concepts, which are organized into groups of synsets that each contain a gloss (i.e., a definition of the target concept), a set of representative English words (called lemmas), and, in around 33k synsets, example sentences. In addition, many synsets have ISA links to other synsets that express complex taxonomic relations. Figure FIGREF6 shows an example and Table TABREF4 summarizes how we formulate WordNet as a set of triples $\\mathcal {T}$ of various types. These triples together represent a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. Our main motivation for using WordNet, as opposed to a resource such as ConceptNet BIBREF36, is the availability of glosses ($\\mathcal {D}$) and example sentences ($\\mathcal {S}$), which allows us to construct natural language questions that contextualize the types of concepts we want to probe.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Example Generation @!START@$\\textsc {gen}(\\tau )$@!END@.\nWe build 4 individual datasets based on semantic relations native to WordNet (see BIBREF37): hypernymy (i.e., generalization or ISA reasoning up a taxonomy, ISA$^\\uparrow $), hyponymy (ISA$^{\\downarrow }$), synonymy, and definitions. To generate a set of questions in each case, we employ a number of rule templates $\\mathcal {Q}$ that operate over tuples. A subset of such templates is shown in Table TABREF8. The templates were designed to mimic naturalistic questions we observed in our science benchmarks.\n\nFor example, suppose we wish to create a question $\\textbf {q}$ about the definition of a target concept $c \\in \\mathcal {C}$. We first select a question template from $\\mathcal {Q}$ that first introduces the concept $c$ and its lemma $l \\in \\mathcal {W}$ in context using the example sentence $s \\in \\mathcal {S}$, and then asks to identify the corresponding WordNet gloss $d \\in \\mathcal {D}$, which serves as the gold answer $\\textbf {a}$. The same is done for ISA reasoning; each question about a hypernym/hyponym relation between two concepts $c \\rightarrow ^{\\uparrow /\\downarrow } c^{\\prime } \\in \\mathcal {T}_{i}$ (e.g., $\\texttt {dog} \\rightarrow ^{\\uparrow /\\downarrow } \\texttt {animal/terrier}$) first introduces a context for $c$ and then asks for an answer that identifies $c^{\\prime }$ (which is also provided with a gloss so as to contain all available context).\n\nIn the latter case, the rules $(\\texttt {isa}^{r},c,c^{\\prime }) \\in \\mathcal {T}_i$ in Table TABREF8 cover only direct ISA links from $c$ in direction $r \\in \\lbrace \\uparrow ,\\downarrow \\rbrace $. In practice, for each $c$ and direction $r$, we construct tests that cover the set HOPS$(c,r)$ of all direct as well as derived ISA relations of $c$:\n\nThis allows us to evaluate the extent to which models are able to handle complex forms of reasoning that require several inferential steps or hops.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Distractor Generation: @!START@$\\textsc {distr}(\\tau ^{\\prime })$@!END@.\nAn example of how distractors are generated is shown in Figure FIGREF6, which relies on similar principles as above. For each concept $c$, we choose 4 distractor answers that are close in the WordNet semantic space. For example, when constructing hypernymy tests for $c$ from the set hops$(c,\\uparrow )$, we build distractors by drawing from $\\textsc {hops}(c,\\downarrow )$ (and vice versa), as well as from the $\\ell $-deep sister family of $c$, defined as follows. The 1-deep sister family is simply $c$'s siblings or sisters, i.e., the other children $\\tilde{c} \\ne c$ of the parent node $c^{\\prime }$ of $c$. For $\\ell > 1$, the $\\ell $-deep sister family also includes all descendants of each $\\tilde{c}$ up to $\\ell -1$ levels deep, denoted $\\textsc {hops}_{\\ell -1}(\\tilde{c},\\downarrow )$. Formally:\n\nFor definitions and synonyms we build distractors from all of these sets (with a similar restriction on the depth of sister distractors as noted above). In doing this, we can systematically investigate model performance on a wide range of distractor sets.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Perturbations and Semantic Clusters\nBased on how we generate data, for each concept $c$ (i.e., atomic WordNet synset) and probe type (i.e., definitions, hypernymy, etc.), we have a wide variety of questions related to $c$ that manipulate 1) the complexity of reasoning that is involved (e.g., the number of inferential hops) and; 2) the types of distractors (or distractor perturbations) that are employed. We call such sets semantic clusters. As we describe in the next section, semantic clusters allow us to devise new types of evaluation that reveal whether models have comprehensive and consistent knowledge of target concepts (e.g., evaluating whether a model can correctly answer several questions associated with a concept, as opposed to a few disjoint instances).\n\nDetails of the individual datasets are shown in Table TABREF12. From these sets, we follow BIBREF22 in allocating a maximum of 3k examples for training and reserve the rest for development and testing. Since we are interested in probing, having large held-out sets allows us to do detailed analysis and cluster-based evaluation.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA\nThe DictionaryQA dataset is created from the GCIDE dictionary, which is a comprehensive open-source English dictionary built largely from the Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary BIBREF38. Each entry consists of a word, its part-of-speech, its definition, and an optional example sentence (see Table TABREF14). Overall, 33k entries (out of a total of 155k) contain example sentences/usages. As with the WordNet probes, we focus on this subset so as to contextualize each word being probed. In contrast to WordNet, GCIDE does not have ISA relations or explicit synsets, so we take each unique entry to be a distinct sense. We then use the dictionary entries to create a probe that centers around word-sense disambiguation, as described below.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA ::: Example and Distractor Generation.\nTo generate gold questions and answers, we use the same generation templates for definitions exemplified in Figure TABREF8 for WordNetQA. To generate distractors, we simply take alternative definitions for the target words that represent a different word sense (e.g., the alternative definitions of gift shown in Table TABREF14), as well as randomly chosen definitions if needed to create a 5-way multiple choice question. As above, we reserve a maximum of 3k examples for training. Since we have only 9k examples in total in this dataset (see WordSense in Table TABREF12), we also reserve 3k each for development and testing.\n\nWe note that initial attempts to build this dataset through standard random splitting gave rise to certain systematic biases that were exploited by the choice-only baseline models described in the next section, and hence inflated overall model scores. After several efforts at filtering we found that, among other factors, using definitions from entries without example sentences as distractors (e.g., the first two entries in Table TABREF14) had a surprising correlation with such biases. This suggests that possible biases involving differences between dictionary entries with and without examples can taint the resulting automatically generated MCQA dataset (for more discussion on the pitfalls involved with automatic dataset construction, see Section SECREF5).",

The field of NLP has advanced substantially with the advent of large-scale language models such as ELMo (BID6), ULMFit (BID37), GPT (BID38), BERT (BID7), and RoBERTa (BID8). These models are trained to perform various language prediction tasks such as predicting a missing word or the next sentence, using large amounts of text (e.g., BERT was trained on Wikipedia + the Google Book Corpus of 10,000 books). They can also be fine-tuned to new language prediction tasks, such as question-answering, and have been remarkably successful in the few months that they have been available. We apply BERT to multiple choice questions by treating the task as classification: Given a question $q$ with answer options $a_{i}$ and optional background knowledge $K_{i}$, we provide it to BERT as:\n\n[CLS] $K_i$ [SEP] $q$ [SEP] $a_{i}$ [SEP] The AristoBERT solver uses three methods to apply BERT more effectively. First, we retrieve and supply background knowledge along with the question when using BERT. This provides the potential for BERT to \u201cread\u201d that background knowledge and apply it to the question, although the exact nature of how it uses background knowledge is more complex and less interpretable.

For example, for the set of a target-aspect pair (LOCATION1, safety), the sentence we generate is \u201cwhat do you think of the safety of location - 1 ?\"\n\nFor the NLI task, the conditions we set when generating sentences are less strict, and the form is much simpler. The sentence created at this time is not a standard sentence, but a simple pseudo-sentence, with (LOCATION1, safety) pair as an example: the auxiliary sentence is: \u201clocation - 1 - safety\".\n\nFor QA-B, we add the label information and temporarily convert TABSA into a binary classification problem ( INLINEFORM0 ) to obtain the probability distribution. At this time, each target-aspect pair will generate three sequences such as \u201cthe polarity of the aspect safety of location - 1 is positive\", \u201cthe polarity of the aspect safety of location - 1 is negative\", \u201cthe polarity of the aspect safety of location - 1 is none\". We use the probability value of INLINEFORM1 as the matching score. For a target-aspect pair which generates three sequences ( INLINEFORM2 ), we take the class of the sequence with the highest matching score for the predicted category.\n\nThe difference between NLI-B and QA-B is that the auxiliary sentence changes from a question to a pseudo-sentence. The auxiliary sentences are: \u201clocation - 1 - safety - positive\", \u201clocation - 1 - safety - negative\", and \u201clocation - 1 - safety - none\".\n\nAfter we construct the auxiliary sentence, we can transform the TABSA task from a single sentence classification task to a sentence pair classification task. As shown in Table TABREF19 , this is a necessary operation that can significantly improve the experimental results of the TABSA task.",

With this baseline we aim at assessing if the tweets' hashtags may help detecting the non-factual accounts.\n\nLR + All Features (tweet-level): We extract all our features from each tweet and feed them into a LR classifier.

We aim at investigating the importance of the sequential flow of tweets.\n\nTop-$k$ replies, likes, or re-tweets: Some approaches in rumors detection use the number of replies, likes, and re-tweets to detect rumors BIBREF21. Thus, we extract top $k$ replied, liked or re-tweeted tweets from each account to assess the accounts factuality. We tested different $k$ values between 10 tweets to the max number of tweets from each account. Figure FIGREF24 shows the macro-F1 values for different $k$ values.

For social scientists working in computational analysis, the questions are often grounded in theory, asking: How can we explain what we observe?

For example, what can we learn about how and why hate speech is used or how this changes over time? Is hate speech one thing, or does it comprise multiple forms of expression? Is there a clear boundary between hate speech and other types of speech, and what features make it more or less ambiguous? Sometimes we also hope to connect to multiple disciplines. For example, while focusing on the humanistic concerns of an archive, we could also ask social questions such as \u201cis this archive more about collaborative processes, culture-building or norm creation?\u201d or \u201chow well does this archive reflect the society in which it is embedded?\" BIBREF3 used quantitative methods to tell a story about Darwin's intellectual development\u2014an essential biographical question for a key figure in the history of science.",

The authors were able to achieve Accuracy of 83.9%, Precision of 80.2%, Recall of 69.8%.\n\nThe approach looked promising given that the dataset was merely 3189 sentences divided into three categories and thus we replicated the experiment but failed to replicate the results. The results were poor than what the original authors achieved. But, most of the model hyper-parameter choices where inspired from this work.\n\nRelated Work ::: Hybrid models\nIn another localized setting of Vietnamese language, Nguyen et al. in 2017 proposed a Hybrid multi-channel CNN and LSTM model where they build feature maps for Vietnamese language using CNN to capture shorterm dependencies and LSTM to capture long term dependencies and concatenate both these feature sets to learn a unified set of features on the messages. These concatenated feature vectors are then sent to a few fully connected layers. They achieved an accuracy rate of 87.3% with this architecture.",

            "input": "Incorporating Document Features ::: Learning Phase ::: Feature Extraction ::: Document-unaware Features\nOrdinal position: It is shown that inclusion of sentence, in summary, is relevant to its position in the document or even in a paragraph. Intuitively, sentences at the beginning or the end of a text are more likely to be included in the summary. Depending on how it is defined, this feature might be document-unaware or not. For example, in BIBREF29 and BIBREF37 it is defined as $\\frac{5}{5}$ for the first sentence, $\\frac{4}{5}$ for the second, and so on to $\\frac{1}{5}$ for fifth and zero for remaining sentences. In another research conducted by Wong et al. BIBREF9, it is defined as $\\frac{1}{sentence\\ number}$. With such a definition, we may have several sentences, for example, with position=$\\frac{1}{5}$ in the training set, these may not have the same sense of position. While a sentence position=$\\frac{1}{5}$ means \u201camong the firsts\u201d in a document with 40 sentences, it has a totally different meaning of \u201cin the middle\u201d, in another document containing 10 sentences. Thus, a useful feature formula should involve differences of documents which may change the meaning of information within it. In our experiments, we used the definition of BIBREF9. A document-aware version of position will be introduced in (SECREF6).\n\nLength of sentence: the intuition behind this feature is that sentences of too long or too short length are less likely to be included in the summary. Like sentence position, this feature is also subject to the wrong definition that makes it document-unaware. For example, in BIBREF9 it is defined as a number of words in a sentence. Such a definition does not take into account that a sentence with, say 15 words may be considered long if all other sentences of document have fewer words. Another sentence with the same number of words may be regarded as short, because other sentences in that document have more than 15 words. This might occur due to different writing styles. However, we included this in our experiments to compare its effect with that of its document-aware counterpart, which will be listed in (SECREF6).\n\nThe Ratio of Nouns: is defined in BIBREF30 as the number of nouns divided by total number of words in the sentence, after stop-words are removed. Three other features, Ratio of Verbs, Ratio of Adjectives, and Ratio of Adverbs are defined in the same manner and proved to have a positive effect on ranking performance. From our perspective, however, a sentence with a ratio of nouns =0.5, for example, in a document containing many nouns, must be discriminated in the training set from another sentence with the same ratio of nouns, that appeared in another document having fewer nouns. This feature does not represent how many nouns are there in the document, which is important in sentence ranking. The same discussion goes on to justify the need to consider the number of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in the document. The impact of these features is examined in our experiments and compared to that of their document-aware counterparts.\n\nThe Ratio of Numerical entities: assuming that sentences containing more numerical data are probably giving us more information, this feature may help us in ranking BIBREF31, BIBREF32. For calculation, we count the occurrences of numbers and digits proportional to the length of sentence. This feature must be less weighted if almost all sentences of a document have numerical data. However, it does not count numbers and digits in other sentences of the document.\n\nCue Words: if a sentence contains special phrases such as \u201cin conclusion\u201d, \u201coverall\u201d, \u201cto summarize\u201d, \u201cin a nutshell\u201d and so forth, its selection as a part of the summary is more probable than others. The number of these phrases is counted for this feature.\n\nIncorporating Document Features ::: Learning Phase ::: Feature Extraction ::: Document-aware Features\nCosine position: As mentioned in (SECREF5) a good definition of position should take into account document length. A well-known formula used in the literature BIBREF38, BIBREF7 is\n\nin which index is an integer representing the order of sentences and T is the total number of sentences in document. This feature ranges from 0 to 1, the closer to the beginning or to the end, the higher value this feature will take. $\\alpha $ is a tuning parameter. As it increases, the value of this feature will be distributed more equally over sentences. In this manner, equal values of this feature in the training set represent a uniform notion of position in a document, so it becomes document-aware.\n\nRelative Length: the intuition behind this feature is explained in (SECREF5). A discussion went there that a simple count of words does not take into account that a sentence with a certain number of words may be considered long or short, based on the other sentences appeared the document. Taking this into consideration, we divided the number of words in the sentence by the average length of sentences in the document. More formally, the formula is:\n\nin which n is number of sentences in the document and $s_i$ is the i\u2019th sentence of it. Values greater than 1 could be interpreted as long and vice versa.\n\nTF-ISF: this feature counts the frequency of terms in a document and assigns higher values to sentences having more frequent terms. It also discounts terms which appear in more sentences. Since it is well explained in the literature, we have not included details and formula which are in references BIBREF34 and BIBREF39. Nonetheless, the aspect that matters in our discussion is that both frequency and inverse sentence frequency are terms which involve properties of context, and consequently are document-aware.\n\nPOS features: Here we introduce another way to include the ratio of part of speech (POS) units in features and keep them document-normalized. To do this, the number of occurrences of each POS unit should be divided by the number of them in the document, instead of that occurring in a sentence. The formal definition of the new document-aware features are as follows:\n\nIncorporating Document Features ::: Learning Phase ::: Feature Extraction ::: Explicit Document Features\nIn order to further investigate how effective are document specific features in sentence ranking, we defined several features for documents. These features are then calculated for each document and repeated in the feature vector of every sentence of that document. Their formal definition is described below and their effect is examined in the result and discussion section (SECREF5):\n\nDocument sentences: An important property of a document that affects summarization is the total number of sentences participating in sentence ranking. As this number grows, a summarizer should be more selective and precise. Also, some sentence features such as cue words, maybe more weighted for longer documents. In addition, the main contextual information is probably more distributed over sentences. In such a case even lower values of other features should be considered important.\n\nDocument words: the number of words in the document is another notion of document length. Since the number of sentences alone is not enough to represent document length, this feature should also be considered.\n\nTopical category: different topics such as political, economic, etc. have different writing styles and this might affect sentence ranking. For instance, numerical entities may appear more in economic or sport reports than in religious or social news. Therefore the weight of this attribute should be more or less, based on a document\u2019s category. So it needs to be included.",

In doing so, the gate architecture learns which words or n-grams contribute to the sentiment the most, these words or n-grams often co-relate with domain independent words. On the other hand the gate gives less weightage to n-grams which are largely either specific to domain or function word chunks which contribute negligible to the overall sentiment. This is what makes gated architectures effective at Domain Adaptation. We see that gated architectures almost always outperform recurrent, attention and linear models BoW, TFIDF, PV. This is largely because while training and testing on same domains, these models especially recurrent and attention based may perform better. However, for Domain Adaptation, as they lack gated structure which is trained in parallel to learn importance, their performance on target domain is poor as compared to gated architectures. As gated architectures are based on convolutions, they exploit parallelization to give significant boost in time complexity as compared to other models. ",

We trained a Doc2Vec model BIBREF15 using the dataset and used the embedding document vectors as features for a linear SVM classifier.\n\nBenchmarks ::: Hierarchical RNN\nFor this benchmark, we considered a Hierarchical RNN, following BIBREF16. We used two BiLSTMs BIBREF17 with 256 units each to model sentences and documents. The tokens of a sentence were processed independently of other sentence tokens. For each direction in the token-level BiLSTM, the last outputs were concatenated and fed into the sentence-level BiLSTM as inputs.\n\nThe outputs of the BiLSTM were connected to 2 dense layers with 256 ReLU units and a Softmax layer. We initialized tokens with publicly available embeddings trained with GloVe BIBREF18. Sentence boundaries were provided by SpaCy. Dropout was applied to the dense hidden layers during training.\n\nBenchmarks ::: Bi-directional RNN and Self-Attention (BiRNN + Self-Attention)\nOne challenge with RNN-based solutions for text classification is finding the best way to combine word-level representations into higher-level representations.\n\nSelf-attention BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21 has been adapted to text classification, providing improved interpretability and performance. We used BIBREF20 as the basis of this benchmark.\n\nThe benchmark used a layered Bi-directional RNN (60 units) with GRU cells and a dense layer. Both self-attention layers were 60 units in size and cross-entropy was used as the cost function.\n\nNote that we have omitted the orthogonal regularizer term, since this dataset is relatively small compared to the traditional datasets used for training such a model. We did not observe any significant performance gain while using the regularizer term in our experiments.\n\nBenchmarks ::: ELMo embedding and Bi-directional RNN (ELMo + BiRNN)\nDeep Contextualized Word Representations (ELMo) BIBREF22 have shown recent success in a number of NLP tasks. The unsupervised nature of the language model allows it to utilize a large amount of available unlabelled data in order to learn better representations of words.\n\nWe used the pre-trained ELMo model (v2) available on Tensorhub for this benchmark. We fed the word embeddings of ELMo as input into a one layer Bi-directional RNN (16 units) with GRU cells (with dropout) and a dense layer. Cross-entropy was used as the cost function.\n\nBenchmarks ::: Fine-tuned BERT\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) BIBREF11 has achieved state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks, including sentence classification.\n\nWe used the fine-tuning procedure outlined in the original work to adapt the pre-trained uncased BERT$_\\textrm {{\\scriptsize LARGE}}$ to a multi-class passage classification task.

Lsa, which uses latent semantic analysis (LSA) to decompose the term-by-sentence matrix of a document and extracts sentences based on the result. We experimented with the two approaches proposed in BIBREF15 and BIBREF16 respectively. LexRank, which constructs a graph representation of a document, where nodes are sentences and edges represent similarity between two sentences, and runs PageRank algorithm on that graph and extracts sentences based on the resulting PageRank values BIBREF17 . TextRank, which is very similar to LexRank but computes sentence similarity based on the number of common tokens BIBREF19 . Bayes, which represents each sentence as a feature vector and uses naive Bayes to classify them BIBREF5 . The original paper computes TF-IDF score on multi-word tokens that are identified automatically using mutual information. We did not do this identification, so our TF-IDF computation operates on word tokens. Hmm, which uses hidden Markov model where states correspond to whether the sentence should be extracted BIBREF20 . The original work uses QR decomposition for sentence selection but our implementation does not. We simply ranked the sentences by their scores and picked the top 3 as the summary. MaxEnt, which represents each sentence as a feature vector and leverages maximum entropy model to compute the probability of a sentence should be extracted BIBREF21 . The original approach puts a prior distribution over the labels but we put the prior on the weights instead. Our implementation still agrees with the original because we employed a bias feature which should be able to learn the prior label distribution. As for the neural supervised method, we evaluated NeuralSum BIBREF11 using the original implementation by the authors. We modified their implementation slightly to allow for evaluating the model with ROUGE. Note that all the methods are extractive. Our implementation code for all the methods above is available online. As a baseline, we used Lead-N which selects INLINEFORM0 leading sentences as the summary.

Given a question-answer pair $\\langle q, a \\rangle $ , the joint probability $P(q, a)$ can be computed in two equivalent ways.\r\n\r\n$$P(q, a) = P(a) P(q|a) = P(q)P(a|q)$$ (Eq. 1)\r\n\r\nThe conditional distribution $P(q|a)$ is exactly the QG model, and the conditional distribution $P(a|q)$ is closely related to the QA model. Existing studies typically learn the QA model and the QG model separately by minimizing their own loss functions, while ignoring the probabilistic correlation between them.\r\n\r\nBased on these considerations, we introduce a training framework that exploits the duality of QA and QG to improve both tasks. There might be different ways of exploiting the duality of QA and QG. In this work, we leverage the probabilistic correlation between QA and QG as the regularization term to influence the training process of both tasks. Specifically, the training objective of our framework is to jointly learn the QA model parameterized by $\\theta _{qa}$ and the QG model parameterized by $\\theta _{qg}$ by minimizing their loss functions subject to the following constraint.\r\n\r\n$$P_a(a) P(q|a;\\theta _{qg}) = P_q(q)P(a|q;\\theta _{qa})$$ (Eq. 3)\r\n\r\n$P_a(a)$ and $P_q(q)$ are the language models for answer sentences and question sentences, respectively. Overall, the framework includes three components, namely a QA model, a QG model and a regularization term that reflects the duality of QA and QG. The QA specific objective aims to minimize the loss function $l_{qa}(f_{qa}(a,q;\\theta _{qa}), label)$ , where $label$ is 0 or 1 that indicates whether $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ or not. For each correct question-answer pair, the QG specific objective is to minimize the following loss function,\r\n\r\n$$l_{qg}(q, a) = -log P_{qg}(q|a;\\theta _{qg})$$ (Eq. 6)\r\n\r\nwhere $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ . The third objective is the regularization term which satisfies the probabilistic duality constrains as given in Equation 3 . Specifically, given a correct $\\langle q, a \\rangle $ pair, we would like to minimize the following loss function,\r\n\r\n$$ \\nonumber l_{dual}(a,q;\\theta _{qa}, \\theta _{qg}) &= [logP_a(a) + log P(q|a;\\theta _{qg}) \\\\ & - logP_q(q) - logP(a|q;\\theta _{qa})]^2$$ (Eq. 9)\r\n\r\nwhere $P_a(a)$ and $P_q(q)$ are marginal distributions, which could be easily obtained through language model.",

Name calling or labeling.\nLabeling the object of the propaganda as something the target audience fears, hates, finds undesirable or otherwise loves or praises BIBREF12.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 3. Repetition.\nRepeating the same message over and over again, so that the audience will eventually accept it BIBREF13, BIBREF12.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 4. Exaggeration or minimization.\nEither representing something in an excessive manner: making things larger, better, worse, or making something seem less important or smaller than it actually is BIBREF14, e.g., saying that an insult was just a joke.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 5. Doubt.\nQuestioning the credibility of someone or something.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 6. Appeal to fear/prejudice.\nSeeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative, possibly based on preconceived judgments.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 7. Flag-waving.\nPlaying on strong national feeling (or with respect to a group, e.g., race, gender, political preference) to justify or promote an action or idea BIBREF15.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 8. Causal oversimplification.\nAssuming one cause when there are multiple causes behind an issue. We include scapegoating as well: the transfer of the blame to one person or group of people without investigating the complexities of an issue.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 9. Slogans.\nA brief and striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping. Slogans tend to act as emotional appeals BIBREF16.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 10. Appeal to authority.\nStating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority/expert on the issue supports it, without any other supporting evidence BIBREF17. We include the special case where the reference is not an authority/expert, although it is referred to as testimonial in the literature BIBREF14.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 11. Black-and-white fallacy, dictatorship.\nPresenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist BIBREF13. As an extreme case, telling the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choice (dictatorship).\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 12. Thought-terminating clich\u00e9.\nWords or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic. They are typically short and generic sentences that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought BIBREF18.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 13. Whataboutism.\nDiscredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly disproving their argument BIBREF19.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 14. Reductio ad Hitlerum.\nPersuading an audience to disapprove an action or idea by suggesting that the idea is popular with groups hated in contempt by the target audience. It can refer to any person or concept with a negative connotation BIBREF20.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 15. Red herring.\nIntroducing irrelevant material to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points made BIBREF11. Those subjected to a red herring argument are led away from the issue that had been the focus of the discussion and urged to follow an observation or claim that may be associated with the original claim, but is not highly relevant to the issue in dispute BIBREF20.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 16. Bandwagon.\nAttempting to persuade the target audience to join in and take the course of action because \u201ceveryone else is taking the same action\u201d BIBREF15.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 17. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness, confusion.\nUsing deliberately unclear words, to let the audience have its own interpretation BIBREF21, BIBREF11. For instance, when an unclear phrase with multiple possible meanings is used within the argument and, therefore, it does not really support the conclusion.\n\nPropaganda Techniques ::: 18.

We describe these datasets below, and we provide a summary of the datasets in Table TABREF17 . ArXiv papers: This dataset contains the abstracts of papers published on the ArXiv under the 19 different tags between April 2007 and June 2015. We treat each tag as a group and fit sefe with the goal of uncovering which words have the strongest shift in usage. We split the abstracts into training, validation, and test sets, with proportions of INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , respectively.\n\nSenate speeches: This dataset contains U.S. Senate speeches from 1994 to mid 2009. In contrast to the ArXiv collection, it is a transcript of spoken language. We group the data into state of origin of the speaker and his or her party affiliation. Only affiliations with the Republican and Democratic Party are considered. As a result, there are 83 groups (Republicans from Alabama, Democrats from Alabama, Republicans from Arkansas, etc.). Some of the state/party combinations are not available in the data, as some of the 50 states have only had Senators with the same party affiliation. We split the speeches into training ( INLINEFORM0 ), validation ( INLINEFORM1 ), and testing ( INLINEFORM2 ).\n\nGrocery shopping data: This dataset contains the purchases of INLINEFORM0 customers. The data covers a period of 97 weeks. After removing low-frequency items, the data contains INLINEFORM1 unique items at the 1.10upc (Universal Product Code) level. We split the data into a training, test, and validation sets, with proportions of INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 , and INLINEFORM4 , respectively. The training data contains INLINEFORM5 shopping trips and INLINEFORM6 purchases in total. For the text corpora, we fix the vocabulary to the 15k most frequent terms and remove all words that are not in the vocabulary. Following BIBREF2 , we additionally remove each word with probability INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is the word frequency. This downsamples especially the frequent words and speeds up training. (Sizes reported in Table TABREF17 are the number of words remaining after preprocessing.) Models. Our goal is to fit the sefe model on these datasets.

These guidelines address common pitfalls and sub-optimal practices we observed in the literature.\n\nGuidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Be explicit in what you evaluate.\nConflating plausability and faithfulness is harmful. You should be explicit on which one of them you evaluate, and use suitable methodologies for each one. Of course, the same applies when designing interpretation techniques\u2014be clear about which properties are being prioritized.\n\nGuidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Faithfulness evaluation should not involve human-judgement on the quality of interpretation.\nWe note that: (1) humans cannot judge if an interpretation is faithful or not: if they understood the model, interpretation would be unnecessary; (2) for similar reasons, we cannot obtain supervision for this problem, either. Therefore, human judgement should not be involved in evaluation for faithfulness, as human judgement measures plausability.\n\nGuidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Faithfulness evaluation should not involve human-provided gold labels.\nWe should be able to interpret incorrect model predictions, just the same as correct ones. Evaluation methods that rely on gold labels are influenced by human priors on what should the model do, and again push the evaluation in the direction of plausability.\n\nGuidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Do not trust \u201cinherent interpretability\u201d claims.\nInherent interpretability is a claim until proven otherwise. Explanations provided by \u201cinherently interpretable\u201d models must be held to the same standards as post-hoc interpretation methods, and be evaluated for faithfulness using the same set of evaluation techniques.\n\nGuidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Faithfulness evaluation of IUI systems should not rely on user performance.\nEnd-task user performance in HCI settings is merely indicative of correlation between plausibility and model performance, however small this correlation is. While important to evaluate the utility of the interpretations for some use-cases, it is unrelated to faithfulness.",

This module starts with a standard information retrieval library to retrieve a small set of candidates for fine-grained filtering as cao2018retrieve. To do that, all non-alphabetic characters (e.g., dates) are removed to eliminate their influence on article matching. The retrieval process starts by querying the training corpus with a source article to find a few (5 to 30) related articles, the summaries of which will be treated as candidate templates. The above retrieval process is essentially based on superficial word matching and cannot measure the deep semantic relationship between two articles. Therefore, the Fast Rerank module is developed to identify a best template from the candidates based on their deep semantic relevance with the source article.

Then, the absolute approach encodes the remaining length:\n\nwhere $i=1,\\ldots ,d/2$.\n\nSimilarly, the relative difference encodes the relative position to the end. This representation is made consistent with the absolute encoding by quantizing the space of the relative positions into a finite set of $N$ integers:\n\nwhere $q_N: [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\lbrace 0, 1, .., N\\rbrace $ is simply defined as $q_N(x) = \\lfloor {x \\times N}\\rfloor $. As we are interested in the character length of the target sequence, len and pos are given in terms of characters, but we represent the sequence as a sequence of BPE-segmented subwords BIBREF17.

However, after a predetermined number of child models, $m$ , have been evaluated, a hurdle, $h_0$ , is created by calculating the the mean fitness of the current population. For the next $m$ child models produced, models that achieve a fitness greater than $h_0$ after $s_0$ train steps are granted an additional $s_1$ steps of training and then are evaluated again to determine their final fitness. Once another $m$ models have been considered this way, another hurdle, $h_1$ , is constructed by calculating the mean fitness of all members of the current population that were trained for the maximum number of steps. For the next $m$ child models, training and evaluation continues in the same fashion, except models with fitness greater than $m$0 after $m$1 steps of training are granted an additional $m$2 number of train steps, before being evaluated for their final fitness.

To examine whether users react to content from trusted sources differently than from deceptive sources, we measure the reaction delay, which we define as the time elapsed between the moment the link or content was posted/tweeted and the moment that the reaction comment or tweet occurred.

A potential way of constructing a graph from a document is by simply observing word co-occurrences. When two words co-occur, they are used as an edge. However, such approaches do not take into account the sequence nature of the words, meaning that the order is lost. We attempt to take this aspect into account as follows. The given corpus is traversed, and for each element INLINEFORM6 , its successor INLINEFORM7 , together with a given element, forms a directed edge INLINEFORM8 . Finally, such edges are weighted according to the number of times they appear in a given corpus. Thus the graph, constructed after traversing a given corpus, consists of all local neighborhoods (order one), merged into a single joint structure.

While this feature might seem a priori useful, it is somewhat limited as this is a free text field that users can leave empty, input a location name that is ambiguous or has typos, or a string that does not match with any specific locations (e.g., \u201cat home\u201d). Looking at users' self-reported locations, Hecht et al. BIBREF49 found that 66% report information that can be translated, accurately or inaccurately, to a geographic location, with the other 34% being either empty or not geolocalisable.\n\nUser language (ulang): This is the user's self-declared user interface language. The interface language might be indicative of the user's country of origin; however, they might also have set up the interface in a different language, such as English, because it was the default language when they signed up or because the language of their choice is not available.\n\nTimezone (tz): This indicates the time zone that the user has specified in their settings, e.g., \u201cPacific Time (US & Canada)\u201d. When the user has specified an accurate time zone in their settings, it can be indicative of their country of origin; however, some users may have the default time zone in their settings, or they may use an equivalent time zone belonging to a different location (e.g., \u201cEurope/London\u201d for a user in Portugal). Also, Twitter's list of time zones does not include all countries.\n\nTweet language (tlang): The language in which a tweet is believed to be written is automatically detected by Twitter. It has been found to be accurate for major languages, but it leaves much to be desired for less widely used languages. Twitter's language identifier has also been found to struggle with multilingual tweets, where parts of a tweet are written in different languages BIBREF50 .\n\nOffset (offset): This is the offset, with respect to UTC/GMT, that the user has specified in their settings. It is similar to the time zone, albeit more limited as it is shared with a number of countries.\n\nUser name (name): This is the name that the user specifies in their settings, which can be their real name, or an alternative name they choose to use. The name of a user can reveal, in some cases, their country of origin.\n\nUser description (description): This is a free text where a user can describe themselves, their interests, etc.\n\nTweet content (content): The text that forms the actual content of the tweet. The use of content has a number of caveats. One is that content might change over time, and therefore new tweets might discuss new topics that the classifiers have not seen before. Another caveat is that the content of the tweet might not be location-specific; in a previous study, Rakesh et al. BIBREF51 found that the content of only 289 out of 10,000 tweets was location-specific.",

We thus enhance the quality of the synthetic examples of the source-originated Fr*-De data by further training its mother translation model (En $\\rightarrow $ Fr). As illustrated in Figure 2 , with the target-originated Fr-De* corpus being fixed, the quality of the models trained with the source-originated Fr*-De data and PSEUDOmix increases in proportion to the quality of the mother model for the Fr*-De corpus. Eventually, PSEUDOmix shows the highest BLEU, outperforming both Fr*-De and Fr-De* data.  As presented in Table 6 , we observe that fine-tuning using ground truth parallel data brings substantial improvements in the translation qualities of all NMT models. Among all fine-tuned models, PSEUDOmix shows the best performance in all experiments. This is particularly encouraging for the case of De $\\rightarrow $ Fr, where PSEUDOmix reported lower BLEU than the Fr-De* data before it was fine-tuned.

Most of the grammatical error correction systems use classification and rule-based approaches for correcting specific error types. However, these systems use several linguistic cues as features. The standard linguistic analysis tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers and parsers are often trained on well-formed text and perform poorly on ungrammatical text. This introduces further errors and limits the performance of rule-based and classification approaches to GEC. As a consequence, the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC has gained popularity because of its ability to learn text transformations from erroneous text to correct text from error-corrected parallel corpora without any additional linguistic information.  We conduct experiments by incorporating NNGLM and NNJM both independently and jointly into our baseline system On top of our baseline system described above, we incorporate the two neural network components, neural network global lexicon model (NNGLM) and neural network joint model (NNJM) as features.

Based on our investigation of several previous studies, we found that most of the works utilized ISO 9241 to assess chatbots' quality by focusing on the usability aspect. This aspect can be grouped into three focuses, including efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction, concerning systems' performance to achieve the specified goals. In automatic evaluation, some studies focus on evaluating the system at emotion level BIBREF15 , BIBREF28 . Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label. This evaluation is similar to emotion classification tasks such as previous SemEval 2018 BIBREF32 and SemEval 2019 . Other studies also proposed to use perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (to determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical) BIBREF14 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF28 . This evaluation metric is widely used to evaluate dialogue-based systems which rely on probabilistic approach BIBREF61 . Another work by BIBREF14 used BLEU to evaluate the machine response and compare against the gold response (the actual response), although using BLEU to measure conversation generation task is not recommended by BIBREF62 due to its low correlation with human judgment. This evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. BIBREF15 used three annotators to rate chatbots' response in two criteria, content (scale 0,1,2) and emotion (scale 0,1). Content is focused on measuring whether the response is natural acceptable and could plausible produced by a human.

The key idea of this framework is to first align $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$ across domains before performing domain-invariant learning, and then take account the shift of $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$ in the label prediction procedure. Specifically, it introduces a class weight $\\mathbf {w}$ to weigh source domain examples by class. Based on the weighted source domain, the domain shift problem is resolved in two steps.  The motivation behind this practice is to adjust data distribution of the source domain or the target domain to alleviate the shift of $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$ across domains before applying DIRL. Consider that we only have labels of source domain data, we choose to adjust data distribution of the source domain. To achieve this purpose, we introduce a trainable class weight $\\mathbf {w}$ to reweigh source domain examples by class when performing DIRL, with $\\mathbf {w}_i > 0$. Specifically, we hope that:\n\nand we denote $\\mathbf {w}^*$ the value of $\\mathbf {w}$ that makes this equation hold.  We shall see that when $\\mathbf {w}=\\mathbf {w}^*$, DIRL is to align $\\rm {P}_S(G(\\rm {X})|\\rm {Y})$ with $\\rm {P}_T(G(\\rm {X})|\\rm {Y})$ without the shift of $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$. According to our analysis, we know that due to the shift of $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$, there is a conflict between the training objects of the supervised learning $\\mathcal {L}_{sup}$ and the domain-invariant learning $\\mathcal {L}_{inv}$. And the conflict degree will decrease as $\\rm {P}_S(\\rm {Y})$ getting close to $\\rm {P}_T(\\rm {Y})$. Therefore, during model training, $\\mathbf {w}$ is expected to be optimized toward $\\mathbf {w}^*$ since it will make $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$ of the weighted source domain close to $\\rm {P}_T(\\rm {Y})$, so as to solve the conflict.",

The softmax activation function is applied to the hidden layer to classify.\n\n2. Insert nonlinear layers: Here, the first architecture is upgraded and an architecture with a more robust classifier is provided in which instead of using a fully connected network without hidden layer, a fully connected network with two hidden layers in size 768 is used. The first two layers use the Leaky Relu activation function with negative slope = 0.01, but the final layer, as the first architecture, uses softmax activation function as shown in Figure FIGREF8.\n\n3. Insert Bi-LSTM layer: Unlike previous architectures that only use [CLS] as the input for the classifier, in this architecture all outputs of the latest transformer encoder are used in such a way that they are given as inputs to a bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-LSTM) as shown in Figure FIGREF8. After processing the input, the network sends the final hidden state to a fully connected network that performs classification using the softmax activation function.\n\n4.

So that the output vectors of each transformer encoder are concatenated, and a matrix is produced. The convolutional operation is performed with a window of size (3, hidden size of BERT which is 768 in BERTbase model) and the maximum value is generated for each transformer encoder by applying max pooling on the convolution output.

The batch selection then works by taking the samples that have largest gradient norms, DISPLAYFORM0\n\nFor RNNs, the gradients for each potential label can be obtained by back-propagation. Another practical issue is that EGL marginalizes over all possible labelings, but in speech recognition, the number of labelings scales exponentially in the number of timesteps. Therefore, we only marginalize over the INLINEFORM0 most probable labelings. They are obtained by beam search decoding, as in BIBREF7 . The EGL method in BIBREF3 is almost the same as Eq.

We chose magnitude weight pruning, which compresses models by removing weights close to 0, because it is one of the most fine-grained and effective compression methods and because there are many interesting ways to view pruning, which we explore in the next section. Our findings are as follows: Low levels of pruning (30-40%) do not increase pre-training loss or affect transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks.",

At the macro level, it is important to decide which is the appropriate field to attend to next and at a micro level (i.e., within a field) it is important to know which values to attend to next. To capture this behavior, we use a bifocal attention mechanism as described below. Fused Attention: Intuitively, the attention weights assigned to a field should have an influence on all the values belonging to the particular field. To ensure this, we reweigh the micro level attention weights based on the corresponding macro level attention weights. In other words, we fuse the attention weights at the two levels as: DISPLAYFORM0\n\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the field corresponding to the INLINEFORM1 -th value, INLINEFORM2 is the macro level context vector.",

We use counts of noun, adjective, adverb, verb words in a tweet as POS features.\n\nPrior polarity of the words: We use a polarity dictionary BIBREF3 to get the prior polarity of words. The dictionary contains positive, negative and neutral words along with their polarity strength (weak or strong). The polarity of a word is dependent on its POS tag. For example, the word `excuse' is negative when used as `noun' or `adjective', but it carries a positive sense when used as a `verb'. We use the tags produced by NLTK postagger while selecting the prior polarity of a word from the dictionary. We also employ stemming (Porter Stemmer implementation from NLTK) while performing the dictionary lookup to increase number of matches. We use the counts of weak positive words, weak negative words, strong positive words and strong negative words in a tweet as features.\n\nWe have also explored some advanced features that helps improve detecting sentiment of tweets.\n\nEmoticons: We use the emoticon dictionary from BIBREF2 , and count the positive and negtive emocicons for each tweet.\n\nThe sentiment of url: Since almost all the articles are written in well-formatted english, we analyze the sentiment of the first paragraph of the article using Standford Sentiment Analysis tool BIBREF4 . It predicts sentiment for each sentence within the article. We calculate the fraction of sentences that are negative, positive, and neutral and use these three values as features.\n\nHashtag: We count the number of hashtags in each tweet.\n\nCapitalization: We assume that capitalization in the tweets has some relationship with the degree of sentiment. We count the number of words with capitalization in the tweets.\n\nRetweet: This is a boolean feature indicating whether the tweet is a retweet or not.\n\nUser Mention: A boolean feature indicating whether the tweet contains a user mention.\n\nNegation: Words like `no', `not', `won't' are called negation words since they negate the meaning of the word that is following it. As for example `good' becomes `not good'. We detect all the negation words in the tweets. If a negation word is followed by a polarity word, then we negate the polarity of that word. For example, if `good' is preceeded by a `not', we change the polarity from `weak positive' to `weak negative'.\n\nText Feature: We use tf-idf based text features to predict the sentiment of a tweet. We perform tf-idf based scoring of words in a tweet and the hashtags present in the tweets. We use the tf-idf vectors to train a classifier and predict the sentiment.

In practice, we select two thresholds $t_\\text{min}$ and $t_\\text{max}$ according to the length ratio distribution. All the sentence pairs with length ratio between $t_\\text{min}$ and $t_\\text{max}$ are in the normal group, the ones with ratio below $t_\\text{min}$ in short and the remaining in long. At training time we prepend a length token to each source sentence according to its group ($<$short$>$, $<$normal$>$, or $<$long$>$), in order to let a single network to discriminate between the groups (see Figure FIGREF2).

There is special type of API, called Streaming API, that provides a real-time stream of tweets. The key difference with regular API is that connection is kept alive as long as possible, and Tweets are sent in real-time to the client. There are three endpoints of Streaming API of our interest: \u201csample\u201d, \u201cfilter\u201d and \u201cfirehose\u201d. The first one provides a sample (random subset) of the full Tweet stream. The second one allows to receive Tweets matching some search criteria: matching to one or more search keywords, produced by subset of users, or coming from certain geo location. The last one provides the full set of Tweets, although it is not available by default. In order to get Twitter \u201cfirehose\u201d one can contact Twitter, or buy this stream from third-parties.\n\nIn our case the simplest approach would be to use \u201csample\u201d endpoint, but it provides Tweets in all possible languages from all over the World, while we are concerned only about one language (Russian). In order to use this endpoint we implemented filtering based on language. The filter is simple: if Tweet does not contain a substring of 3 or more cyrillic symbols, it is considered non-Russian. Although this approach keeps Tweets in Mongolian, Ukrainian and other slavic languages (because they use cyrillic alphabet), the total amount of false-positives in this case is negligible. To demonstrate this we conducted simple experiment: on a random sample of 200 tweets only 5 were in a language different from Russian. In order not to rely on Twitter language detection, we chose to proceed with this method of language-based filtering.\n\nHowever, the amount of Tweets received through \u201csample\u201d endpoint was not satisfying. This is probably because \u201csample\u201d endpoint always streams the same content to all its clients, and small portion of it comes in Russian language. In order to force mining of Tweets in Russian language, we chose \"filter\" endpoint, which requires some search query. We constructed heuristic query, containing some auxiliary words, specific to Russian language: conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions.

This gap isn't a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easy-negative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones, which has a huge negative effect on the final F1 performance.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose to multiply the soft probability $p$ with a decaying factor $(1-p)$, changing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22 to the following form:\n\nOne can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.\n\nA close look at Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 reveals that it actually mimics the idea of focal loss (FL for short) BIBREF16 for object detection in vision. Focal loss was proposed for one-stage object detector to handle foreground-background tradeoff encountered during training.

Following the traditional approach adopted by BIBREF7 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF9 and many other studies, we train our neural network as follows. At each time step, we present one input character to our model and then ask it to predict the set of next possible characters, based on the current character and the prior hidden states. Given a vocabulary $\\mathcal {V}^{(i)}$ of size $d$ , we use a one-hot representation to encode the input values; therefore, all the input vectors are $d$ -dimensional binary vectors. The output values are $(d+1)$ -dimensional though, since they may further contain the termination symbol $\\dashv $ , in addition to the symbols in $\\mathcal {V}^{(i)}$ . The output values are not always one-hot encoded, because there can be multiple possibilities for the next character in the sequence, therefore we instead use a $k$ -hot representation to encode the output values.

Most of the grammatical error correction systems use classification and rule-based approaches for correcting specific error types. However, these systems use several linguistic cues as features. The standard linguistic analysis tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers and parsers are often trained on well-formed text and perform poorly on ungrammatical text. This introduces further errors and limits the performance of rule-based and classification approaches to GEC. As a consequence, the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC has gained popularity because of its ability to learn text transformations from erroneous text to correct text from error-corrected parallel corpora without any additional linguistic information.  We model our GEC system based on the phrase-based SMT approach. However, traditional phrase-based SMT systems treat words and phrases as discrete entities. We take advantage of continuous space representation by adding two neural network components that have been shown to improve SMT systems BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . To train NNJM, we use the publicly available implementation, Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) BIBREF14 . The latest version of Moses can incorporate NNJM trained using NPLM as a feature while decoding. Similar to NNGLM, we use the parallel text used for training the translation model in order to train NNJM. We use a source context window size of 5 and a target context window size of 4. We select a source context vocabulary of 16,000 most frequent words from the source side. The target context vocabulary and output vocabulary is set to the 32,000 most frequent words.

We again have three flavors: one single-task (BiGRU-ATT-S-1) and two multi-task (BiGRU-ATT-M-1 and BiGRU-ATT-M-5).\n\nMethods ::: Baselines ::: ROUGE:\nThis baseline is the ROUGE version that performs best on each dataset, among the versions considered by BIBREF13. Although ROUGE focuses on surface similarities between peer and reference summaries, we would expect properties like grammaticality, referential clarity and coherence to be captured to some extent by ROUGE versions based on long $n$-grams or longest common subsequences.\n\nMethods ::: Baselines ::: Language model (LM):\nFor a peer summary, a reasonable estimate of $\\mathcal {Q}1$ (Grammaticality) is the perplexity returned by a pre-trained language model. We experiment with the pre-trained GPT-2 model BIBREF22, and with the probability estimates that BERT can produce for each token when the token is treated as masked (BERT-FR-LM). Given that the grammaticality of a summary can be corrupted by just a few bad tokens, we compute the perplexity by considering only the $k$ worst (lowest LM probability) tokens of the peer summary, where $k$ is a tuned hyper-parameter.\n\nMethods ::: Baselines ::: Next sentence prediction:\nBERT training relies on two tasks: predicting masked tokens and next sentence prediction. The latter seems to be aligned with the definitions of $\\mathcal {Q}3$ (Referential Clarity), $\\mathcal {Q}4$ (Focus) and $\\mathcal {Q}5$ (Structure & Coherence). Intuitively, when a sentence follows another with high probability, it should involve clear referential expressions and preserve the focus and local coherence of the text. We, therefore, use a pre-trained BERT model (BERT-FR-NS) to calculate the sentence-level perplexity of each summary:\n\nwhere $p(s_i|s_{i-1})$ is the probability that BERT assigns to the sequence of sentences $\\left< s_{i-1}, s \\right>$, and $n$ is the number of sentences in the peer summary.",

As a first step towards solving this problem, we evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art models developed for other QA tasks, including a sentence-level prediction task and two segment retrieval tasks. Baselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction\nGiven a transcript (a sequence of sentences) and a question, Baseline1 predicts (starting sentence index, ending sentence index). The model is based on RaSor BIBREF13, which has been developed for the SQuAD QA task BIBREF6. RaSor concatenates the embedding vectors of the starting and the ending words to represent a span. Following this idea, Baseline1 represents a span of sentences by concatenating the vectors of the starting and ending sentences. The left diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline1 model.\n\nModel. The model takes two inputs, a transcript, $\\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_n\\rbrace $ where $s_i$ are individual sentences and a question, $q$. The output is the span scores, $y$, the scores over all possible spans. GLoVe BIBREF14 is used for the word representations in the transcript and the questions. We use two bi-LSTMs BIBREF15 to encode the transcript.\n\nwhere n is the number of sentences . The output of Passage-level Encoding, $p$, is a sequence of vector, $p_i$, which represents the latent meaning of each sentence. Then, the model combines each pair of sentence embeddings ($p_i$, $p_j$) to generate a span embedding.\n\nwhere [$\\cdot $,$\\cdot $] indicates the concatenation. Finally, we use a one-layer feed forward network to compute a score between each span and a question.\n\nIn training, we use cross-entropy as an objective function. In testing, the span with the highest score is picked as an answer. Baselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval\nWe also considered a simpler task by casting our problem as a retrieval task. Specifically, in addition to a plain transcript, we also provided the model with the segmentation information which was created during the data collection phrase (See Section. SECREF3). Note that each segments corresponds to a candidate answer. Then, the task is to pick the best segment for given a query. This task is easier than Baseline1's task in that the segmentation information is provided to the model. Unlike Baseline1, however, it is unable to return an answer span at various granularities. Baseline2 is based on the attentive LSTM BIBREF17, which has been developed for the InsuranceQA task. The right diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline2 model.\n\nModel. The two inputs, $s$ and $q$ represent the segment text and a question. The model first encodes the two inputs.\n\n$h^s$ is then re-weighted using attention weights.\n\nwhere $\\odot $ denotes the element-wise multiplication operation. The final score is computed using a one-layer feed-forward network.\n\nDuring training, the model requires negative samples. For each positive example, (question, ground-truth segment), all the other segments in the same transcript are used as negative samples. Cross entropy is used as an objective function.\n\n Baselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval\nWe construct a pipelined approach through another segment retrieval task, calculating the cosine similarities between the segment and question embeddings. In this task however, we want to test the accuracy of retrieving the segments given that we first retrieve the correct video from our 76 videos. First, we generate the TF-IDF embeddings for the whole video transcripts and questions. The next step involves retrieving the videos which have the lowest cosine distance between the video transcripts and question. We then filter and store the top ten videos, reducing the number of computations required in the next step. Finally, we calculate the cosine distances between the question and the segments which belong to the filtered top 10 videos, marking it as correct if found in these videos. While the task is less computationally expensive than the previous baseline, we do not learn the segment representations, as this task is a simple retrieval task based on TF-IDF embeddings.\n\nModel. The first two inputs are are the question, q, and video transcript, v, encoded by their TF-IDF vectors: BIBREF18:\n\nWe then filter the top 10 video transcripts(out of 76) with the minimum cosine distance, and further compute the TF-IDF vectors for their segments, Stop10n, where n = 10. We repeat the process for the corresponding segments:\n\nselecting the segment with the minimal cosine distance distance to the query.",

This holds for the Relevant category ($0.81$), the Vaccine category ($0.79$) and the Positive category ($0.64$).

Similarly, they can be applied online during each epoch of LF-MMI training, without the need for realignment.\n\nConsider each utterance (i.e. after the audio segmentation in Section SECREF5), and we compute its log mel spectrogram with $\\nu $ dimension and $\\tau $ time steps:\n\nFrequency masking is applied $m_F$ times, and each time the frequency bands $[f_0$, $f_0+ f)$ are masked, where $f$ is sampled from $[0, F]$ and $f_0$ is sampled from $[0, \\nu - f)$.\n\nTime masking is optionally applied $m_T$ times, and each time the time steps $[t_0$, $t_0+ t)$ are masked, where $t$ is sampled from $[0, T]$ and $t_0$ is sampled from $[0, \\tau - t)$. Data augmentation ::: Speed and volume perturbation\nBoth speed and volume perturbation emulate mean shifts in spectrum BIBREF18, BIBREF19. To perform speed perturbation of the training data, we produce three versions of each audio with speed factors $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1$. The training data size is thus tripled. For volume perturbation, each audio is scaled with a random variable drawn from a uniform distribution $[0.125, 2]$.",

The initial step is therefore feature combination, with the phonetic feature used as auxiliary information to assist acoustic RNN LID. This is improved further, as additional research identified that a simpler model using only the phonetic feature as the RNN LID input provides even better performance. We call this RNN model based on phonetic features the phonetic temporal neural LID approach, or PTN LID. As well as having a simplified model structure, the PTN offers deeper insight into the LID task by rediscovering the value of the phonetic temporal property in language discrimination. ",

The weights we observe vary in the amount of insight provided: for example, offering extra help at the end of a conversation, or thanking the customer yields more satisfied customers, and more resolved problems (with ratios of above 6:1). However, some outcomes are much more subtle: for example, asking yes-no questions early-on in a conversation is highly associated with problem resolution (ratio 3:1), but asking them at the end of a conversation has as similarly strong association with unsatisfied customers. Giving elaborate answers that are not a simple affirmative, negative, or response acknowledgement (i.e. Answer (Other)) towards the middle of a conversation leads to satisfied customers that are not frustrated.

The first uses neural question-answering technique to extract relations from a story text. The second, provided as a baseline, uses OpenIE5, a commonly used rule-based information extraction technique. For the sake of simplicity, we considered primarily the location-location and location-character/object relations, represented by the \u201cnext to\u201d and \u201chas\u201d edges respectively in Figure FIGREF4. We instead propose a new method that leverages models trained for context-grounded question-answering tasks to do entity extraction with no task dependent data or fine-tuning necessary. Our method, dubbed AskBERT, leverages the Question-Answering (QA) model ALBERT BIBREF15. AskBERT consists of two main steps as shown in Figure FIGREF7: vertex extraction and graph construction. The first step is to extract the set of entities\u2014graph vertices\u2014from the story. We are looking to extract information specifically regarding characters, locations, and objects. This is done by using asking the QA model questions such as \u201cWho is a character in the story?\u201d. BIBREF16 have shown that the phrasing of questions given to a QA model is important and this forms the basis of how we formulate our questions\u2014questions are asked so that they are more likely to return a single answer, e.g. asking \u201cWhere is a location in the story?\u201d as opposed to \u201cWhere are the locations in the story?\u201d. In particular, we notice that pronoun choice can be crucial; \u201cWhere is a location in the story?\u201d yielded more consistent extraction than \u201cWhat is a location in the story?\u201d. ALBERT QA is trained to also output a special <$no$-$answer$> token when it cannot find an answer to the question within the story. Our method makes use of this by iteratively asking QA model a question and masking out the most likely answer outputted on the previous step. This process continues until the <$no$-$answer$> token becomes the most likely answer. The first step is to extract the set of entities\u2014graph vertices\u2014from the story. We are looking to extract information specifically regarding characters, locations, and objects. This is done by using asking the QA model questions such as \u201cWho is a character in the story?\u201d. BIBREF16 have shown that the phrasing of questions given to a QA model is important and this forms the basis of how we formulate our questions\u2014questions are asked so that they are more likely to return a single answer, e.g. asking \u201cWhere is a location in the story?\u201d as opposed to \u201cWhere are the locations in the story?\u201d. In particular, we notice that pronoun choice can be crucial; \u201cWhere is a location in the story?\u201d yielded more consistent extraction than \u201cWhat is a location in the story?\u201d. ALBERT QA is trained to also output a special <$no$-$answer$> token when it cannot find an answer to the question within the story. Our method makes use of this by iteratively asking QA model a question and masking out the most likely answer outputted on the previous step. This process continues until the <$no$-$answer$> token becomes the most likely answer.\n\nThe next step is graph construction. Typical interactive fiction worlds are usually structured as trees, i.e. no cycles except between locations. Using this fact, we use an approach that builds a graph from the vertex set by one relation\u2014or edge\u2014at a time. Once again using the entire story plot as context, we query the ALBERT-QA model picking a random starting location $x$ from the set of vertices previously extracted.and asking the questions \u201cWhat location can I visit from $x$?\u201d and \u201cWho/What is in $x$?\u201d. The methodology for phrasing these questions follows that described for the vertex extraction. The answer given by the QA model is matched to the vertex set by picking the vertex $u$ that contains the best word-token overlap with the answer. Relations between vertices are added by computing a relation probability on the basis of the output probabilities of the answer given by the QA model. We compared our proposed AskBERT method with a non-neural, rule-based approach. This approach is based on the information extracted by OpenIE5, followed by some post-processing such as named-entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. OpenIE5 combines several cutting-edge ideas from several existing papers BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19 to create a powerful information extraction tools. For a given sentence, OpenIE5 generates multiple triples in the format of $\\langle entity, relation, entity\\rangle $ as concise representations of the sentence, each with a confidence score. These triples are also occasionally annotated with location information indicating that a triple happened in a location.\n\nAs in the neural AskBERT model, we attempt to extract information regarding locations, characters, and objects. The entire story plot is passed into the OpenIE5 and we receive a set of triples. The location annotations on the triples are used to create a set of locations. We mark which sentences in the story contain these locations. POS tagging based on marking noun-phrases is then used in conjunction with NER to further filter the set of triples\u2014identifying the set of characters and objects in the story.\n\nThe graph is constructed by linking the set of triples on the basis of the location they belong to. While some sentences contain very explicit location information for OpenIE5 to mark it out in the triples, most of them do not. We therefore make the assumption that the location remains the same for all triples extracted in between sentences where locations are explicitly mentioned. For example, if there exists $location A$ in the 1st sentence and $location B$ in the 5th sentence of the story, all the events described in sentences 1-4 are considered to take place in $location A$. The entities mentioned in these events are connected to $location A$ in the graph.",

Following the setting of previous works, we treated a reviews as class `1' if it was ranked up to 3 stars, and as class `2' if it was ranked 4 or 5 stars. For each task, $\\mathcal {D}_S$ consisted of 1,000 examples of each class, and $\\mathcal {D}_T$ consists of 1500 examples of class `1' and 500 examples of class `2'. In addition, since it is reasonable to assume that $\\mathcal {D}_T$ can reveal the distribution of target domain data, we controlled the target domain testing dataset to have the same class ratio as $\\mathcal {D}_T$. Using the same label assigning mechanism, we also studied model performance over different degrees of $\\rm {P}(\\rm {Y})$ shift, which was evaluated by the max value of $\\rm {P}_S(\\rm {Y}=i)/\\rm {P}_T(\\rm {Y}=i), \\forall i=1, \\cdots , L$.

As more than one user may interact with a given post, we first add a maximum pooling layer after the user matrix embedding layer and user vector embedding layer to form a moderator matrix embedding INLINEFORM0 and a moderator vector embedding INLINEFORM1 for moderator INLINEFORM2 respectively, where INLINEFORM3 is used for the semantic transformation in the document composition process, as mentioned in the previous section. The term moderator here is to denote the pseudo user who provides the overall semantic/sentiment of all the engaged users for one document. The embedding INLINEFORM4 models the moderator stance preference, that is, the pattern of the revealed user stance: whether a user is willing to show his preference, whether a user likes to show impartiality with neutral statements and reasonable arguments, or just wants to show strong support for one stance. Ideally, the latent user stance is modeled by INLINEFORM5 for each user. Likewise, for topic information, a maximum pooling layer is added after the topic matrix embedding layer and topic vector embedding layer to form a joint topic matrix embedding INLINEFORM6 and a joint topic vector embedding INLINEFORM7 for topic INLINEFORM8 respectively, where INLINEFORM9 models the semantic transformation of topic INLINEFORM10 as in users and INLINEFORM11 models the topic stance tendency. The latent topic stance is also modeled by INLINEFORM12 for each topic.\n\nAs for comments, we view them as short documents with authors only but without likers nor their own comments. Therefore we apply document composition on comments although here users are commenters (users who comment). It is noticed that the word embeddings INLINEFORM0 for the same word in the posts and comments are the same, but after being transformed to INLINEFORM1 in the document composition process shown in Figure FIGREF4 , they might become different because of their different engaged users. The output comment representation together with the commenter vector embedding INLINEFORM2 and topic vector embedding INLINEFORM3 are concatenated and a maximum pooling layer is added to select the most important feature for comments. Instead of requiring that the comment stance agree with the post, UTCNN simply extracts the most important features of the comment contents; they could be helpful, whether they show obvious agreement or disagreement. Therefore when combining comment information here, the maximum pooling layer is more appropriate than other pooling or merging layers. Indeed, we believe this is one reason for UTCNN's performance gains.\n\nFinally, the pooled comment representation, together with user vector embedding INLINEFORM0 , topic vector embedding INLINEFORM1 , and document representation are fed to a fully connected network, and softmax is applied to yield the final stance label prediction for the post.",

TextCat is not the only example of an off-the-shelf implementation of the out-of-place method: other implementations include libtextcat with 76 language models, JTCL with 15 languages, and mguesser with 104 models for different language-encoding pairs. The main issue addressed by later implementations is classification speed: TextCat is implemented in Perl and is not optimized for speed, whereas implementations such as libtextcat and mguesser have been specifically written to be fast and efficient. whatlang-rs uses an algorithm based on character trigrams and refers the user to the BIBREF7 article. It comes pre-trained with 83 languages.\n\nis the language identifier embedded in the Google Chrome web browser. It uses a NB classifier, and script-specific classification strategies. assumes that all the input is in UTF-8, and assigns the responsibility of encoding detection and transcoding to the user. uses Unicode information to determine the script of the input. also implements a number of pre-processing heuristics to help boost performance on its target domain (web pages), such as stripping character sequences like .jpg. The standard implementation supports 83 languages, and an extended model is also available, that supports 160 languages.\n\nis a Java library that implements a language identifier based on a NB classifier trained over character . The software comes with pre-trained models for 53 languages, using data from Wikipedia. makes use of a range of normalization heuristics to improve the performance on particular languages, including: (1) clustering of Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters to reduce sparseness; (2) removal of \u201clanguage-independent\u201d characters, and other text normalization; and (3) normalization of Arabic characters.\n\nis a Python implementation of the method described by BIBREF150 , which exploits training data for the same language across multiple different sources of text to identify sequences of characters that are strongly predictive of a given language, regardless of the source of the text. This feature set is combined with a NB classifier, and is distributed with a pre-trained model for 97 languages prepared using data from 5 different text sources. BIBREF151 provide an empirical comparison of to , and and find that it compares favorably both in terms of accuracy and classification speed. There are also implementations of the classifier component (but not the training portion) of in Java, C, and JavaScript.\n\nBIBREF153 uses a vector-space model with per-feature weighting on character sequences. One particular feature of is that it uses discriminative training in selecting features, i.e. it specifically makes use of features that are strong evidence against a particular language, which is generally not captured by NB models. Another feature of is that it uses inter-string smoothing to exploit sentence-level locality in making language predictions, under the assumption that adjacent sentences are likely to be in the same language. BIBREF153 reports that this substantially improves the accuracy of the identifier. Another distinguishing feature of is that it comes pre-trained with data for 1400 languages, which is the highest number by a large margin of any off-the-shelf system.\n\nwhatthelang is a recent language identifier written in Python, which utilizes the FastText NN-based text classification algorithm. It supports 176 languages.\n\nimplements an off-the-shelf classifier trained using Wikipedia data, covering 122 languages. Although not described as such, the actual classification algorithm used is a linear model, and is thus closely related to both NB and a cosine-based vector space model.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned general-purpose language identifiers, there have also been efforts to produce pre-trained language identifiers targeted specifically at Twitter messages. is a Twitter-specific tool with built-in models for 19 languages. It uses a document representation based on tries BIBREF401 . The algorithm is a LR classifier using all possible substrings of the data, which is important to maximize the available information from the relatively short Twitter messages.\n\nBIBREF152 provides a comparison of 8 off-the-shelf language identifiers applied without re-training to Twitter messages. One issue they report is that comparing the accuracy of off-the-shelf systems is difficult because of the different subset of languages supported by each system, which may also not fully cover the languages present in the target data. The authors choose to compare accuracy over the full set of languages, arguing that this best reflects the likely use-case of applying an off-the-shelf system to new data. They find that the best individual systems are , and , but that slightly higher accuracy can be attained by a simple voting-based ensemble classifier involving these three systems.\n\nIn addition to this, commercial or other closed-source language identifiers and language identifier services exist, of which we name a few.

            "input": "Results ::: CoinCollector\nIn this setting, we compare the number of actions played in the environment (frames) and the score achieved by the agent (i.e. +1 reward if the coin is collected). In Go-Explore we also count the actions used to restore the environment to a selected cell, i.e. to bring the agent to the state represented in the selected cell. This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively. In case of Game CoinCollector,  In CookingWorld, we compared models in the three settings mentioned earlier, namely, single, joint, and zero-shot. In all experiments, we measured the sum of the final scores of all the games and their trajectory length (number of steps). Table TABREF26 summarizes the results in these three settings. Phase 1 of Go-Explore on single games achieves a total score of 19,530 (sum over all games), which is very close to the maximum possible points (i.e. 19,882), with 47,562 steps. A winning trajectory was found in 4,279 out of the total of 4,440 games. This result confirms again that the exploration strategy of Go-Explore is effective in text-based games. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of the simple imitation learning policy trained using the extracted trajectories in phase 1 of Go-Explore in the three settings mentioned above. In this setting, each model is trained from scratch in each of the 4,440 games based on the trajectory found in phase 1 of Go-Explore (previous step). As shown in Table TABREF26, the LSTM-DQN BIBREF7, BIBREF8 approach without the use of admissible actions performs poorly. One explanation for this could be that it is difficult for this model to explore both language and game strategy at the same time; it is hard for the model to find a reward signal before it has learned to model language, since almost none of its actions will be admissible, and those reward signals are what is necessary in order to learn the language model. As we see in Table TABREF26, however, by using the admissible actions in the $\\epsilon $-greedy step the score achieved by the LSTM-DQN increases dramatically (+ADM row in Table TABREF26). DRRN BIBREF10 achieves a very high score, since it explicitly learns how to rank admissible actions (i.e. a much simpler task than generating text). Finally, our approach of using a Seq2Seq model trained on the single trajectory provided by phase 1 of Go-Explore achieves the highest score among all the methods, even though we do not use admissible actions in this phase. However, in this experiment the Seq2Seq model cannot perfectly replicate the provided trajectory and the total score that it achieves is in fact 9.4% lower compared to the total score achieved by phase 1 of Go-Explore. Figure FIGREF61 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows the score breakdown for each level and model, where we can see that the gap between our model and other methods increases as the games become harder in terms of skills needed. In this setting the 4,440 games are split into training, validation, and test games. The split is done randomly but in a way that different difficulty levels (recipes 1, 2 and 3), are represented with equal ratios in all the 3 splits, i.e. stratified by difficulty. As shown in Table TABREF26, the zero-shot performance of the RL baselines is poor, which could be attributed to the same reasons why RL baselines under-perform in the Joint case. Especially interesting is that the performance of DRRN is substantially lower than that of the Go-Explore Seq2Seq model, even though the DRRN model has access to the admissible actions at test time, while the Seq2Seq model (as well as the LSTM-DQN model) has to construct actions token-by-token from the entire vocabulary of 20,000 tokens. On the other hand, Go-Explore Seq2Seq shows promising results by solving almost half of the unseen games. Figure FIGREF62 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows that most of the lost games are in the hardest set, where a very long sequence of actions is required for winning the game. These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games.",

It displays statistics that provide important evidence as to the scale of harassment and that can serve as the basis for more effective interventions to be developed by authorities ranging from advocacy organizations to policy makers. It provides evidence to support some commonly assumed factors about harassment: First, we demonstrate that harassment occurred more frequently during the night time than the day time. Second, it shows that besides unspecified strangers (not shown in the figure), conductors and drivers are top the list of identified types of harassers, followed by friends and relatives. Furthermore, we uncovered that there exist strong correlations between the age of perpetrators and the location of harassment, between the single/multiple harasser(s) and location, and between age and single/multiple harasser(s) (Figure FIGREF20).  We also found that the majority of young perpetrators engaged in harassment behaviors on the streets. These findings suggest that interventions with young men and boys, who are readily influenced by peers, might be most effective when education is done peer-to-peer. It also points to the locations where such efforts could be made, including both in schools and on the streets.  In contrast, we found that adult perpetrators of sexual harassment are more likely to act alone. Most of the adult harassers engaged in harassment on public transportation. These differences in adult harassment activities and locations, mean that interventions should be responsive to these factors. For example, increasing the security measures on transit at key times and locations. In addition, we also found that the correlations between the forms of harassment with the age, single/multiple harasser, type of harasser, and location (Figure FIGREF21). For example, young harassers are more likely to engage in behaviors of verbal harassment, rather than physical harassment as compared to adults. It was a single perpetrator that engaged in touching or groping more often, rather than groups of perpetrators. In contrast, commenting happened more frequently when harassers were in groups. Last but not least, public transportation is where people got indecently touched most frequently both by fellow passengers and by conductors and drivers. The nature and location of the harassment are particularly significant in developing strategies for those who are harassed or who witness the harassment to respond and manage the everyday threat of harassment. For example, some strategies will work best on public transport, a particular closed, shared space setting, while other strategies might be more effective on the open space of the street.",

It then uses the query representation to locate relevant regions in the image and uses this to pick an answer from a fixed vocabulary.\n\n- SANDYBIBREF1: This is the best performing model on the DVQA dataset and is a variant of SAN. Unfortunately, the code for this model is not available and the description in the paper was not detailed enough for us to reimplement it. Hence, we report the numbers for this model only on DVQA (from the original paper).\n\n- VOES: This is our model as described in section SECREF3 which is specifically designed for questions which do not have answers from a fixed vocabulary.\n\n- VOES-Oracle: blackThis is our model where the first three stages of VOES are replaced by an Oracle, i.e., the QA model answers questions on a table that has been generated using the ground truth annotations of the plot. With this we can evaluate the performance of the WikiTableQA model when it is not affected by the VED model's errors.\n\n- SAN-VOES: Given the complementary strengths of SAN-VQA and VOES, we train a hybrid model with a binary classifier which given a question decides whether to use the SAN or the VOES model. The data for training this binary classifier is generated by comparing the predictions of a trained SAN model and a trained VOES model on the training dataset. For a given question, the label is set to 1 (pick SAN) if the performance of SAN was better than that of VOES. We ignore questions where there is a tie. The classifier is a simple LSTM based model which computes a representation for the question using an LSTM and uses this representation to predict 1/0.

Our coverage enhancement starts by transforming the knowledge base INLINEFORM0 into a vector space representation that is comparable to that of the corpus-based space INLINEFORM1 . To this end, we use two techniques for learning low-dimensional feature spaces from knowledge graphs: DeepWalk and node2vec. DeepWalk uses a stream of short random walks in order to extract local information for a node from the graph. By treating these walks as short sentences and phrases in a special language, the approach learns latent representations for each node. Similarly, node2vec learns a mapping of nodes to continuous vectors that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. Thanks to a flexible objective that is not tied to a particular sampling strategy, node2vec reports improvements over DeepWalk on multiple classification and link prediction datasets. For both these systems we used the default parameters and set the dimensionality of output representation to 100. Also, note than nodes in the semantic graph of WordNet represent synsets. Hence, a polysemous word would correspond to multiple nodes. In our experiments, we use the MaxSim assumption of BIBREF11 in order to map words to synsets.",

This indicates that the task of POS labeling (word-level POS tagging) is not an ideal task for contemplating the syntactic understanding of contextual word embeddings.

As gated architectures are based on convolutions, they exploit parallelization to give significant boost in time complexity as compared to other models. The effectiveness of gated architectures rely on the idea of training a gate with sole purpose of identifying a weightage. In the task of sentiment analysis this weightage corresponds to what weights will lead to a decrement in final loss or in other words, most accurate prediction of sentiment. In doing so, the gate architecture learns which words or n-grams contribute to the sentiment the most, these words or n-grams often co-relate with domain independent words.

In support of this hypothesis, we found a strong negative correlation between informativity and error rates across items and conditions: listeners make fewer errors when utterances are a better fit for the target relative to the distractor ( $\\rho = -0.81$ , bootstrapped 95% CI $= [-0.9, -0.7]$ ; Fig. 6 B). This result suggests that listener behavior is driven by an expectation of speaker informativity: listeners interpret utterances proportionally to how well they fit objects in context. Our Rational Speech Act (RSA) formalization of cooperative reasoning in this context predicts that speakers (directors) naturally increase the informativity of their referring expressions to hedge against the increased risk of misunderstanding; Exp. 1 presents direct evidence in support of this hypothesis. Exp. 2 is consistent with this hypothesis; when directors used underinformative scripted instructions (taken from prior work), listeners made significantly more errors than when speakers were allowed to provide referring expressions at their natural level of informativity, and speaker informativeness strongly modulated listener error rates.",

For this baseline, unsupervised LDA is used instead of pLSA, and the labels from the different annotators for kNN (with INLINEFORM0 ) are aggregated using majority voting (mv).\n\nThe results obtained by the different approaches for the LabelMe data are shown in Fig. FIGREF94 , where the svi version is using mini-batches of 200 documents.\n\nAnalyzing the results for the Reuters-21578 and LabelMe data, we can observe that MA-sLDAc outperforms all the baselines, with slightly better accuracies for the batch version, especially in the Reuters data. Interestingly, the second best results are consistently obtained by the multi-annotator approaches, which highlights the need for accounting for the noise and biases of the answers of the different annotators. Both the batch and the stochastic variational inference (svi) versions of the proposed model (MA-sLDAc) are compared with the following baselines:\n\n[itemsep=0.02cm]\n\nLDA + LogReg (mv): This baseline corresponds to applying unsupervised LDA to the data, and learning a logistic regression classifier on the inferred topics distributions of the documents. The labels from the different annotators were aggregated using majority voting (mv). Notice that, when there is a single annotator label per instance, majority voting is equivalent to using that label for training. This is the case of the 20-Newsgroups' simulated annotators, but the same does not apply for the experiments in Section UID89 .\n\nLDA + Raykar: For this baseline, the model of BIBREF21 was applied using the documents' topic distributions inferred by LDA as features.\n\nLDA + Rodrigues: This baseline is similar to the previous one, but uses the model of BIBREF9 instead.\n\nBlei 2003 (mv): The idea of this baseline is to replicate a popular state-of-the-art approach for document classification. Hence, the approach of BIBREF0 was used. It consists of applying LDA to extract the documents' topics distributions, which are then used to train a SVM.

Our experiments show that using whole documents (i. e., full news articles) as unit of evaluation increases the rating gap between human and machine translation (Section SECREF4).\n\nRecommendations ::: (R3) Evaluate fluency in addition to adequacy.\nRaters who judge target language fluency without access to the source texts show a stronger preference for human translation than raters with access to the source texts (Sections SECREF4 and SECREF24). In all of our experiments, raters prefer human translation in terms of fluency while, just as in BIBREF3's BIBREF3 evaluation, they find no significant difference between human and machine translation in sentence-level adequacy (Tables TABREF21 and TABREF30). Our error analysis in Table TABREF34 also indicates that MT still lags behind human translation in fluency, specifically in grammaticality.\n\nRecommendations ::: (R4) Do not heavily edit reference translations for fluency.\nIn professional translation workflows, texts are typically revised with a focus on target language fluency after an initial translation step. As shown in our experiment in Section SECREF24, aggressive revision can make translations more fluent but less accurate, to the degree that they become indistinguishable from MT in terms of accuracy (Table TABREF30).\n\nRecommendations ::: (R5) Use original source texts.\nRaters show a significant preference for human over machine translations of texts that were originally written in the source language, but not for source texts that are translations themselves (Section SECREF35). Our results are further evidence that translated texts tend to be simpler than original texts, and in turn easier to translate with MT.",

We notice that while the not-sarcastic patterns generated for RQs are similar to the topic-specific not-sarcastic patterns we find in the general dataset, there are some interesting features of the sarcastic patterns that are more unique to the RQs.\n\nMany of our sarcastic questions focus specifically on attacks on the mental abilities of the addressee. This generalization is made clear when we extract and analyze the verb, subject, and object arguments using the Stanford dependency parser BIBREF32 for the questions in the RQ dataset. Hyperbole. One common pattern for hyperbole involves adverbs and adjectives, as noted above. We did not use this pattern to retrieve hyperbole, but because each hyperbolic sarcastic utterance contains multiple cues, we learn an expanded class of patterns for hyperbole.  We learn a number of verbal patterns that we had not previously associated with hyperbole, as shown in Table TABREF34 . Interestingly, many of these instantiate the observations of CanoMora2009 on hyperbole and its related semantic fields: creating contrast by exclusion, e.g. no limit and no way, or by expanding a predicated class, e.g. everyone knows.

By doing this, we aim to incorporate semantic information from an external lexical resource into the word embedding so that the embedding dimensions are aligned along predefined concepts. This alignment is achieved by introducing a modification to the embedding learning process. In our proposed method, which is built on top of the GloVe algorithm BIBREF2 , the cost function for any one of the words of concept word-groups is modified by the introduction of an additive term to the cost function.
