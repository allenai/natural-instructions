            "output": "The 1975 -- 76 season of the National Basketball Association was the 30th season of the NBA .",
            "explanation": "The paraphrase of the original sentence in English is correct and accurate because even though sentence order has been changed, the denotion that the 30th season of the NBA occurred in the years 1975 - 1976 is retained."
