    "Definition": "In this task, structured regex expression is given as an input and your task is to generate a description in natural language for the given structured regex expression. The description should eliminate ambiguity and clearly explain the constraints a string (i.e., generated from regex expression) should follow to match the pattern. The regex structure may include functions like (1) 'concat' to combine two expression passed to it. (2) 'repeatrange' to repeat the expression for a given number of times. The first will be the minimum and the second will be the maximum. (3) 'repeatatleast' -> takes an expression and a number to be repeated a given number of times. (4) 'optional' -> takes an expression that may or may not be present. (5) 'repeat' -> repeat an expression an exact number of times. There may also be terms to denote the patterns like (1) '<cap>' -> Captial Alphabets (2) 'let' -> Both upper case and lower case letters. (3) '<num>' -> denotes a digit. (4) '<low>' -> denotes the lower case letters. (5) '<any>' -> denotes any character including numbers, letters and special characters.",
