I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet.

The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the \"modern\" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for \"hill\"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the \"cream\" in between.  Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.  But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.  These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: \"Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees\").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.",

Those who rate it badly, some say it has no flavor or there aren't chunks in it.

If I want to, next time I will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it's contents- not a big deal to do.

I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.  Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned.",

But I am very happy.  I use Reaper to record vocals with a ASIO driver (AND IT DOES WORK WITH MY ASIO DRIVER) someone put in their comment that it doesnt. For those of you that arnt familure with ASIO it is a driver/program that runs and samples your audio going in, you basically use it with anything that is MIDI or MIDI/MIC to USB. It makes your audio not lag and sound more professional. Also for the people that said the volume was too low, go into Sound in windows and turn the mic up a little, I keep mine on 5%. Also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after.  GO AHEAD AND BUY ONE!",

Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?  Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?  One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.  So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.  The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.  With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.  This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.",

I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain.

So this was a real treat - outstanding aroma just opening the bag, and even better when brewing. Delightfully smooth taste, and highly drinkable black (the only way I drink coffee or tea).  My only complaint is opening the bag. Based on what other reviewers stated, I opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills. Very glad I did - an appreciable amount was spilled when I cut into the bag. I decanted it into an air-tight container. I've had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee, but the very fine grind of the Melitta made it even more of a problem.  Still, not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star.

I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.  To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.  Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out.",

            "input": "This is one of my favorite Life Savers flavors, and like almost all flavors, it has gotten hard to find it locally.  I rarely see the roll version of anything other than Pep-O-Mint and Wint-O-Green. Remember the days when you could go into a store and find tons of Life Savers? Berry (was it called Mixed Berries or Wild Berry?), Tropical Fruits, Fancy Fruits, Wild Cherry, Butter Rum ... the original Five Flavor mix, and two of my long-gone favorites: Butter Mint and Tangerine! I really miss those days!  I can still find the Butter Rum and Wild Cherry at my local pharmacy. They're both better for soothing a scratchy throat than any cough drop that they sell, so it makes sense that they'd have them there. In the supermarket I can often find them both - plus the new version of the Five Flavor mix (which isn't as good as the original), but these are individually wrapped candy in bags. They are bigger than the roll version, and I prefer the rolls.  There was a gas station in my area that sold these Spear-O-Mint rolls, but they stopped about a year ago. I am so happy to have found a source for them here at Amazon. YIPPEE! Now if only they'd come back with the Tangerine and Butter Mint! I can't understand how the convenience store shelves can contain 100 different types of super mints (I can't stand the overpoweringly strong mints and gums sold today), but not make room for old fashioned, traditional Life Savers!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * UPDATE: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  I had originally given this product 5 stars, but I have now had to lower the rating to just 3 stars. I've opened six rolls of the Life Savers and three of them have contained completely crushed candies. Each mint is broken into 4-6 chunks and a bunch of minty powder. What a mess! Even the three that were not completely broken, were at least partially broken.  The package seemed to be in good shape when it arrived with no signs of damage, so one can only assume that this damage was done before the product was shipped. I don't know how the remaining 14 rolls will size up, but it's not looking hopeful.  I was so excited to receive this product, and now I am so disappointed.  # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # FURTHER UPDATE: # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #  I've now opened just about all of the rolls of Life Savers and every single roll (other than the first three good ones mentioned above) contained broken candy. Most were completely shattered or contained about 80% broken candy. Just a few rolls contained at least half unbroken candy. As I've said, the packaging was not damaged at all, so these were obviously broken before they were shipped out. Most likely, they were stored and/or handled improperly.  Oh well. I guess that Life Savers are getting to be thing of the past. You can hardly find good flavors locally, and obviously mail order is not an option. This sure was a pricy lesson for me.",

Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.  These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of \"calms\" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.  Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not \"crispy\" cookies, or the blurb would say \"crispy,\" rather than \"chewy.\"  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.  So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.",

One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a \"tinny\" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.

It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).  I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor.

Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.  I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats.

I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know...\"I thought you said 5 stars.\"  It gets better.)  Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.  Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.

I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.  As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better.

The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their \"original\" flavor...I can't imagine what the \"Salt & Pepper\" style must be like.  I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a \"healthy\" alternative to chips.",

I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.  What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar \"heaviness\" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.  I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.  It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.  In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.  5 stars.",

I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh.  Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes....  I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix.  Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred.  It's complicated!  Amazon has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS5K\">Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. Amazon, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store.  In order to enhance customer demand, Amazon's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features:  -Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!) -The moistest, most delicious -A special treat for the special people  Of course, \"the special people\" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's \"America's Favorite Cake\". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix!  Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough \"the moistest, most delicious\" yellow cake for a very large number of \"the special people\".  Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Amazon suggests \"Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought\": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, \"the special people\" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers.  A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy!

It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.  The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.",

Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn't melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I'm definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can't find a local store  EDIT: Oct 11, 2012  *****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****  So I decided to restock after I couldn't fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.  Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won't change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn't \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.",

While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain \"different\" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: \"it really is delicious for a decaf.\"  The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.  The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.  I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this.",

In a highly (un)scientific blind taste test involving my three children, the Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle mix was the unanimous choice.  I make a triple batch according to the instructions--although i use only one tablespoon of melted butter instead of three--and the batter stores well in the fridge for up to four days. The triple batch makes 4 1/2 waffles on our waffle maker and they are crispy, light, and golden brown.  This brand is slightly more expensive per waffle than the normal grocery store brands (like Krusteaz), but our family thinks the taste is worth it. As an aside, my son has a soy allergy and this mix is free of soy--unlike most other brands.",

So my love of food has driven me to learn how to make decent versions of food I like which are gluten and dairy free.  I am now a MASTER pizza chef, to put it modestly.  Practically a PIZZA GOD.  I've got the pizza stone, the piel, found the best gf crust, the best df cheese, and the result is usually pretty great.  ANYWAY...  I like mushrooms on my pizza, specifically SLICED mushrooms, and I make pizza at home often enough that checking out at the grocery store with 20 or 30 cans of sliced mushrooms draws awkward stares.  The solution, of course, is to order in bulk via Amazon.  Have done this many times, trying out different brands, etc.  I'm almost certain I'd purchased this exact product in the past with no issues...but this latest shipment brought with it a harrowing ordeal involving smelly mushrooms and untopped pizzas.  At first I thought I might have gotten a bad can, so I tossed the first stinky one.  Then the next one smelled just as bad.  Now - the smell isn't a rotten smell or an unnatural smell.  The best way I can describe it is a combination of normal canned mushroom smell and... horse shit.  If you don't know what horse shit smells like just imagine dog shit with a lot of hay and some mud mixed in.  So I stopped there and made my pizza without toppings.  The next day or two when I made another pizza I decided maybe my sense of smell had been off before and to try opening another can of mushrooms from the same case.  Same fecal smell.  Even after extensive rinsing it smelled like I had been rinsing the mushrooms in an unflushed toilet bowl.  I had my wife smell the can (oh, she LOVES being asked to smell-check gross stuff...actually, no).  She agreed with the horse shit description.  I put the remaining cans back on a high shelf far out of sight.  When next I went to the grocery store (actually, Target I think) I got a couple cans of Green Giant sliced mushrooms and later when I used them on a pizza they smelled totally normal and free of ungulate diarrhea.  You can see in the attached image how one of my normal pizzas comes out...with normal mushrooms.  So I'm highly disappointed...and it's left me feeling unsure of any Giorgio mushroom cans...and unsure about any organic mushroom cans...and just about canned mushrooms in general.  I like to use fresh when I have them (like, as I write this)...but most of the time when I make a pizza I use canned shrooms.  But I feel deeply scarred by this turd-infused experience and may have trouble trusting any canned mushrooms for a while.  Which is definitely going to cramp my style pizza-wise.  LAME!  (In case anyone is wondering, this is not a joke, even if it may be funny to laugh at my stinky mushroom ordeal.  I lived it and I have the battle scars to prove it.)",

A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.\"  The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. \"Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,\" the directions say.  Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  \"These things tend to be wolfed down,\" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. \"They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old.

As far as the acid free part, that seemed to be true. It didn't flip out my stomach with too much acid like some coffee's do. I just didn't like the flavor of it. When I first opened the bag of coffee I didn't like the smell of it either. It just didn't have that nice coffee smell. Not sure what it smelled like, but it wasn't coffee and it was a really dark black fine grind that didn't look much like coffee either. I assumed that the package was supposed to be for a single pot of coffee and used the whole thing in my Bun Coffee brewer. It could have been too strong because my Bun Coffee brewer has a smaller pot than my old Mr Coffee does. But it doesn't seem to make that much difference with my usual Folgers coffee. While it was brewing it didn't smell much like coffee either. I tried a couple cups and it was so strong that after I dumped the grounds out of the basket I ran a couple cups of water through it to dilute the pot of coffee a little bit. Didn't help any, it still tasted way too strong for me. If I had some more of it I might try using half the prepackaged amount but I don't think it would change the taste of it all that much. Would I buy some of this coffee anyway because its acid free? No. Wouldn't matter how cheap it was either. Would I recommend this coffee to somebody? Not if they were one of my friends! Who would like this coffee? Maybe somebody that's used to having the very strong espresso coffee or the super strong coffee I've heard they drink in the middle east.

And well now the family loves them and looks forward to Sunday waffles every couple weeks.  I even double up the ingredients so I can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them.  These can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast.  Forget the Eggos even as frozen waffles these are great.  What do I like best about them?  The waffles come out light and fluffy.  They are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries, nuts or whatever toppings you may choose.  In no way do they feel heavy or soggy.  They are a snap to prepare, and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker. Lastly the whole family loves them.  So despite the higher price it is well worth every penny.",

So first, the ingredient \"vegetarian spices\" includes granulated garlic powder, possibly onion. In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.

First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.  I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.  They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.  So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1 - 2 bags a day!!!  They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.  So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.  Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends/family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.

I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.",

However, the treats are far from gourmet as the packaging, price, and picture would suggest. In fact, they're really no different than the run-of-the-mill soft dog treats that you can buy for half the price. One thing I always loved about the Cesars line is that their dog food actually smells palatable. It doesn't just have a meat-like aroma but a meaty aroma...a big difference. The same difference in quality can't be found in the treats though. Upon opening, I was at once overcome by a strong, acrid and chemical-like aroma. Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it. I gave the package to a neighbor who feeds her dogs Ol' Roy treats which resemble these in texture and smell and they loved them. Nothing wrong with Ol' Roy btw...but why pay three times the price for the same thing?",

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",

Oreos might taste a wee bit better but then they're Oreos, come on.  A cool fact I found out when I was looking up ingredients for Whonu Chocolate Sandwich cookies and Oreos, the first ingredient in regular Oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies I think it is flour.

The slightly high price tag would have been worth it if this product had lived up to its hype.  I had hopes that this brand would be different, but it wasn't.  The morning after this arrived in the mail, I had a friend over for morning coffee and we both had a cup together.  I brewed it using a drip method and we sat down to see if this really was better than the average coffee.  She thought it tasted very good, but I didn't think the taste was anything special.  Still, I hoped it would leave me feeling better than coffee usually does.  At first I was OK, but about an hour after drinking my coffee, the old, familiar burning sensation in my gut started.  Then, the inflammation in my joints and soft tissues.  This experiment had failed miserably and I had to endure an entire day regretting that I had tried this coffee.  At midnight, I was still feeling bad from a cup of coffee I had drunk at 8:00 am.  Just a side note about low acid coffee:  ANY coffee (no mater how cheap) can be made low acid by a cold brewing method.  Just type \"cold coffee brewers\" into Amazon's search engine and you will see all kinds of contraptions that will make low acid coffee.  It is the brewing method that develops acid, and not the type or brand of coffee you use.  ALSO, there are health problems associated with coffee that have little to do with acid. If you have any kind of inflammation, brewing low acid coffee will not help that because coffee is intrinsicly inflamatory.  I will not be using the rest of this.  It might be low acid, but it seems that any acid at all is too much for some people.  Coffee is just not worth the consequences for me.  UPDATE - October 2, 2011:  5 DAYS LATER, my joints still hurt from this experiment.  My daughter is a professional barrista, so I gave her a cup to try and asked for her \"expert\" opinion.  Her verdict was that it is poor quality coffee that is extremely bitter.  Not a very good reccommendation!",

Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.

I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later.

That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed. I am really confused/irritated how my review for \"alive and aware raw cacao\" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say \"out of stock\" or \"currently unavailable\" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around? Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao. I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand. Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the \"brands\" and \"vendors\" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said \"alive and aware\" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.  For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.  Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!! I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food \"of the Gods\" (theobroma) as they say :) My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!! Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw. Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!",

(We've only been together almost five years!)  I, on the other hand, have never cared for pancakes.  I loved my Gram's waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. I just didn't care for PANCAKES!  She did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my Daddy enjoyed pancakes, so I learned. I was in Central Market on Saturday when I ran into a co-worker and her husband.  They took me by the hand from the Baking Products isle to the Jams, Jelly, Syrup, Honey isle.  On the top shelf was \"the very best pancake mix\":  Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix. I saw the price and took a deep breath, it was twice the price of the mix I had just been contemplating purchasing. On their recommendation, I tossed it in the cart along with some \"real\" organic, light amber, maple syrup. This morning, I fixed three small (3 inch diameter) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. I needed to know! Well, I don't believe I have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. I have NEVER liked that stuff! That pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was DELICIOUS! It was the pancake mix that made the difference. Now I am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker.  After tasting that light, fluffy pancake, I can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix.  These reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation! I will never buy any thing else.",

Just set a limit of 1 bag.  Cons: As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.",

There's no problem with the Blue Icicle itself though. There would be a problem when trying to install this with Windows 7. There was no problem at all using it with Windows XP. It seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being 'Blue Icicle'. Instead, it would show up as 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device'. It just didn't sound the same when I was using it with Windows XP. It sounded more louder with some feedback in the background. What I did to fix this problem was to uninstall the 'USB Multi-Channel Audio Device' driver from Device Manager, then unplug the Icicle and plug it back in. When the 'Installing device driver software' notification pops up, click it and click 'Skip obtaining driver software from Windows Update'. It will now be installed as 'Blue Icicle' and work like how it should be! Make sure you raise the levels up in Sound in Control Panel if the mic sounds too low for you, even with the Gain Control Volume up; it shouldn't be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this problem, but I hope this helps whoever does!  When I first got the Icicle, it sounded amazing and I had a lot of fun with it! I still do, too! I use this with my Audio-Technica AT2020. I use it almost everyday, whether if it's for music producing or online gaming with friends.

I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!!

When I contacted them by email they informed me that \"THIS IS OUR POLICY\" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ \"Package!!! RIDICULOUS!!

White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.  As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.  I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.  I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.  That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.

If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.  However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.  You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow you'll need to put out for the birds?  Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.  So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.  I'm not really a health nut so if I wanted an orange soda, I'd just go out and get an Orange Crush.",

Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"  Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.  You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a \"diet\" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being \"too salty\" or \"high in sodium\". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.",

Here they are:  INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)  Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.  So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?  Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.  I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.  In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.  Pam T~ mom/blogger/brownie baker",

They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.  This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.  If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).  Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.  However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).",

The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.",

What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...  Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.  All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.",

I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was \"breed-specific\" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently \"forgot\" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the \"breed-specific\" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!  And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!",

As I read some reviews only at that point, some parents had pointed out these were rancid, and I could confirm my can smelled bad as well.  Too bad Amazon would not accept returns on these products.

            "input": "from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:  Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.  Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.  It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word \"Agave\" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.  Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.  Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as \"diabetic friendly\". What's not to like?  As it turns out, quite a lot.  Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.  All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.  Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.  Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .  And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.  In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.  \"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,\" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses\", she told me. \"Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK\".  Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.",

However, at $5 per box, the cost of the other ingredients you must add, time to prepare, and the small amount of product in the box, I suggest you look at other gluten-free products from Pamela's, The Gluten Free Pantry, Bob's Red Mill, or Arrowhead Mills.  You may see a better value for your food dollars.  Incidentally, Arrowhead Mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare, but I believe you are getting more product in the bag.  Feeding a family of 4 would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this product.  If the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price, I would have given it 5 stars. Safeway was the first store in San Francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products.  Now, however, it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching $6 per box.  Forget it at those prices.  Hey, it's largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar!  Bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat GF product in its inventory.  I would certainly buy it.",

The slippery terminology used for 'truffle' oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, \"infused\" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle \"aroma.\"  When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.  Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma.",

It's baking outcome is very desireable.  I have never had trouble with it. In fact, many times the comments I get on my baked goods from my non-GF friends is that they can't tell it's gluten free.

The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.  So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...  I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...  This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly. BUYER BEWARE!",

I would be able to load up 50 k-cups with any type of coffee I chose, and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning. After waiting a month for this product to reach me (20 days before they even shipped it!) I finally found it on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher; these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than I expected. I filled one and snapped the lid down. I ensured it was sealed all the way around, placed it in my Kuerig, and hit the brew button. At first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it isn't supposed to. By the time it was over I had quite a mess to clean up. Upon opening the Kuerig I found the DisposaKup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly. However the bit of overhanging filter was soaked, dripping, and HOT! I had discovered the source of the leak. I have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem. I guess I should have bought the EcoBrew cup after all.  If you like the appearance of convenience, and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you.  (I went ahead and gave it two stars because I like the idea of the product so much.)",

I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.",

I just got back from a Bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  They're usually pretty honest about how the gluten-free food I take tastes, even telling me once that some store-bought cookies I took tasted like cardboard.  I did notice a VERY SLIGHT bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  I think next time I make these I may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  Oh, and I only added 3 TBS of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  I'm sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.  I just went to the Hodgson Mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  This mix does not have garbanzo flour.  They use sorghum instead, now.  I did not make these as muffins.  I found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which I prefer to muffins.  Very good.  I will continue to make these when I need something fast and don't have time to make it from scratch.

The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.  What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.

Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.  The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right. See photo added.  I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!  The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more \"plain\" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.  My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but I'd rather buy this mix than other GF products I've tried that are just as pricey and don't taste nearly as good.",

It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.

And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being \"off the grid\".  The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.  A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.  This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.  This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but I'd want her to if in danger.

Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked \"brushed\" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.  Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle \"look\", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing. NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.  Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example \"JR Mushrooms & Specialties\" on Amazon, is a good start--about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).",

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]  From the article:  Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.  No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",

Furthermore, I had to ask a coffee lover for an opinion, so I asked my mother-in-law, who drinks all kinds of coffees from all over the world almost 5 times a day.  She was skeptical at first, because she refuses to drink decaf.  However, after a few sips of this coffee, she said that although it is a \"mild\" coffee, it was in fact very tasty and nothing hinted at its decaf origins.  She liked it so much, she poured another cup.  Between the two of us, we have almost finished the bag.  It should pass the test from even the pickiest coffee drinkers.

Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.  I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.  However, this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes!  If these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers, this would be a very ideal gift/house warming present for these hot summer months!

I doubt that I will be trying any of the other fresh mixers unless I get them for free, like I did with this one, but I just had to find a place on-line to express how awful it tastes. I hate to throw away food, but this was simply inedible. My stomache and head were both hurting after just a few bites. My body was completey rejecting this garbage from the time I started eating it. I hope that Healthy Choice contacts me to offer me a job as a taste-tester, because I would never let any food-maker release this product with confidence. Stay away from this product.",

I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.  Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.) Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)  I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.  It seems to be hit or miss with the \"Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket\" purchase.  I will not say flat out \"NO!

I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!  The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.  I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.  This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.",

It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it.

A few friends of mine that tried it and said,\"It wasn't bad.\" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments. If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.

I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.  Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.  Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).  Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.  If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).",

With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one.

Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.  SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say \"Natural\" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?",

Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.  But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.  I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!

I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.

The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.  Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.  Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.  Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

            "input": "MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Hey guys, So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs. So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!  THEIR ANSWER  Dear Dave,  Thank you for contacting Nature's One®.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic® formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.  Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic® formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic® falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5. Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.  The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic® formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic® formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.  Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials® DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.  If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.  DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs  Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.  Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.  However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.  Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.  The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.   (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, \"The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,\" Allergy 56; 5:403  I hope this information is helpful to you.

These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of \"made in USA\", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food.

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.  Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.  When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.  Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.",

Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable.

            "input": "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.  I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.  My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.  I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.  For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.  We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.  A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.  So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.  I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.  Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",

I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.",

So it strikes out as a medicine, but how is it as a beverage? The answer is, at best, nothing special.  While billed as a \"dark French roast\", the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso, and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste, which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor, such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water. In fairness, my wife liked it more, but she regularly dilutes the coffee that I make... why pay for gourmet when you could just add water?",

Well, if that is the case, then there must be way too much licorice root in this stuff. So much licorice in fact, that the liquid is very thick (almost chewy) and dark brown in color. I felt excited for hours after drinking it. Whatever the nebulous \"natural root beer flavor\" is, it could very well be some type of rare herb that is dangerous to some people, like Ephedra or St. John's Wort for example. (Beware of potential drug interactions with unidentified herbs). It was a surprise to drink this, because it doesn't taste like root beer to me at all. It tastes like crap. I could barely drink this stuff. I had to choke it down, and quite frankly, I felt like I was going to regurgitate it back up. I bought a whole 24 pack of it from Amazon before even testing it. A huge waste of money. I will never ever in my life by this product again, nor recommend it to anyone. What I do recommend though is: A), never buy Blue sky Organic Root Beer. B), Do some research first on root beer before buying it over the internet. Subsequent to my purchase, I discovered several websites that rate the flavor of root beer on the internet, and Blue sky Organic Root Beer was at the bottom of every one.

Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!",

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is \"store fat!\" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.  My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the \"during taste\" either.  Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)  Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!",

Martek advertises this formula on their website!  \"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents\".  Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be \"agricultural ingredients.\" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as \"necessary vitamins and minerals,\" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:  Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and \"other\" undisclosed ingredients) Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol) Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium Heavily processed ingredients that are far from \"natural\"  quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.  This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula: AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg  Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: \"includes mutant organisms\" and \"recombinant organisms\", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is \"extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.\"  The patent for Life'sARA states: \"genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid\" and \"extraction with solvents such as ... hexane.\" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.  Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.  BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.  Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom  The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.",

I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.  I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.  In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.",

I was sent these gummy bears by accident when I ordered the sour gummy bears (also by Surf Sweets) and I am glad I was, as these are absolutely delicious. They have the same texture as regular gummy bears, though if you let them warm up a little bit or get an off batch they may be a little bit chewier.  Some find them a little bit sweeter than regular gummy bears, but I think that is due to the lack of corn syrup. I don't really notice any difference. Note that these do still contain gelatin, so vegans should NOT eat this (I think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for vegans). The natural fruit juice flavors are delicious, and the fact that you get your vitamin C as well is just an added bonus. I would definitely recommend these, though I suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one go!  One last caveat - if you are on a budget I suggest you go with the Surf Sweets Sour Gummy Bears (also available on Amazon) as they are ten dollars cheaper. I'm still unsure of the reason for the price difference, but if you're on a budget the other ones are great too!",

My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.",

But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.  Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.  I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.  I love my animal.

So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.  I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.

I had never ordered any, but I came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last Christmas.  I have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say I have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  Pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually I buy the cheapest I can find, or at least one that I am familiar with.  I tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. But every now and then I get curious of a brand like this one. It just so happens that when I visited this camping store, I was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  Unfortunately it wasn't 'till I left that I realized that this mix was not one of the \"just add water\" ones that we all know and love.  The best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  So instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, I have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  I really don't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes I have ever tasted from a mix.  They are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  If you have a pancake fiend in your home, I would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. Its cheaper here on Amazon than I paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. I have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... Highly recommended...",

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and \"other natural flavors\", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.  I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.  I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not \"slivered\" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.  So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" from the same company.

But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars.",

I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.  HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.

If you're on the go, the advantage of these bottles of Gatorade is this: because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular, larger size bottles of Gatorade G2.

However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.  First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.  Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.  Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.  I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.  It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!",

I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.  When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a \"test\" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.  So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  \"Icicle compatibility with Windows 7\", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.  Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle \"techs\" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us \"technical support\", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.  I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.  If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.",

I had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when I discovered they were not on the low-carb diet I'd switched to, I had to find something else to use as a substitute.  NuStevia products are what I chose.  I tried several other types of stevia, but NuStevia products seem to be the best so far.  The bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from NuStevia products.

The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.  Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky.

I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.  A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.  On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house.",

It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

In my opinion, they need to up the powdered milk in them, or the non-dairy creamer in them.  It would improve this product so greatly.  They are thieves nonetheless, you usually get 10 envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks, buy two for less than ten, and still be spending less than what I spent with these.

I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.  The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G\">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.  I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy!",

My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.  I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients.

The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.  If you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat, having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation.  I'm happy with one square most days.

            "input": "UPDATE: April 3, 2009 I \"ordered\" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: \"A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE.\" Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be \"healthy.\" Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.  As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The \"diet\" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of \"off the diet.\"  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a \"wolf in lamb's clothing\" for those who consider themselves \"heath conscious.\"  The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:  \"The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]\"  Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas: Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml) Servings [per can]: 1 Total Fat: 0g  0% DV Sodium: 15mg  1% DV Total Carb: 34g  11% DV  SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g Protein: 0g  0% DV  Then separately listed: Vitamin C: 100%  There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.  Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as \"Carb\" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.  As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR): Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).  Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].  Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.  That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.  But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?",

First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.  Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.  Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.

Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.  So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.  Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.",

Also, I found that this coffee had a quite strong bitter taste.  Though, I did notice that this coffee did seem to be easier on my stomach. I'm sure this might work well for someone who loves coffee, but, has a sensitive stomach.  Overall, a basic French roast nothing too spectacular. Might be good for someone who wants a low acid coffee who is willing to sacrifice the typical French roast depth of flavor.

I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.  Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.  Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"  I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA\">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.  The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.  In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.",

She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a>  Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.  In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month.

Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, \"Hey, that's the perfect solution!\". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.  I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love.",

I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a \"gravy\" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.",

Four flavors are here: noisette, hazelnuts, alpine milk and strawberry. All are delicious, though I don't like strawberry/chocolate (in any candy) personally, and give those away to eager friends. The Naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work.  Milka and its famous purple cow, is owned by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries.  Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate.

            "input": "Let's get this out of the way, first: Yes the case is made of thin flimsy plastic, and it doesn't look like it can handle drops to the floor.  I'm using it with a Behringer ecm8000 mic and Real Time Analyzer (RTA) software (on my laptop running WindowsXP PRO SP3) to precisely tune notch filters and speaker crossover networks and it works perfectly.  Audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope, with peaks at 90 degrees (which is a good sign).  No hissing sounds at all, it's very quiet with a mic connected, high frequency-spectrum wise.  For the record, I bought a usb to Toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptop/PC sound cards are usually noisy as hell.  I think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources (e.g. cheesy soundcards, amps, receivers or multimedia speakers), or even lousy, improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit, but who knows.  What I can safely say is, for the cheap price, the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrum.  WINDOW7 FUNCTIONALITY(updated): At first, it didn't work with WINDOWS7 x64 Ultimate.  I kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver.  And at the time the Icicle website made no mention of Windows 7 compatibility (2 months later, they are saying it's compatible with XP, VISTA and Windows 7).  After nearly giving up, I found my old USB motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar mini-usb header to the that of the Icicle's.  I connected the Icicle using the motorola cable into my Windows 7 PC, and to my surprise it was recognized.  I actually got the idea when the Icicle began losing its USB connection (with the original cable) whenever I moved it around a lot.  Could it be the dinky looking USB cable included with the Icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with Windows 7?  I'm really not sure at this point.  What I can say is that the Blue Icicle seems 100% reliable when used with the old Motorola USB cable.  Perhaps the Motorola cable makes better contact or has better shielding--who knows.  (I'm inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original Icicle cable just see if it's shielded to the USB's electrical ground source.  It wouldn't be the first time I find an unshielded USB cable.  Then again, it might be the mini-USB header causing the problem.)",

I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.  I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.  After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just \"something she picked up,\" but the dog food itself.  Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.

Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.  I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.  What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.  I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it \"tea\".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.  What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.

To start with I do experience occasional heartburn, reflux, etc, so this was a very exciting taste test. I brewed a pot of fairly well renowned regular coffee, and a pot of Puroast. I poured both into identical cups, no milk or sugar to start with. The regular coffee had a deep brown color, while the Puroast had a black brown color. I tested the pH of both, the regular was about 5-5.5 while the Puroast was indeed 7.0 or neutral as claimed. First taste was of the Puroast as I did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste. Good grief... It was wet, it was warm, very flat taste with no finish, hardly what I would call even an average cup of coffee. The best comparison is that to a day old coffee that has been left to evaporate and oxidize. Perhaps burned charcoal aroma with hints of bitter chocolate and caramel? The standard coffee by comparison had a rich coffee aroma, and the taste was wonderfully balanced coffee bean with tinge of vanilla, and a pleasant finish with a slight kick (the balance finish kick is unfortunately from the acid).  I now added some whole milk, and as expected the regular coffee mellowed out a bit, but all of the wonderful flavor still came across. Incredibly when I added milk to the Puroast, it turned a poor tasting cup into an awful tasting cup. The flavor now became that of  mostly spoiled milk! This was such a strange sensation that I had three more people confirm the sour milk phenomenon. To top things of, the color had now become that of black brown mud.  So all in all, this was a bad experience. If you have a need to drink a low acid coffee do this. Get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead.",

To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.  I'm the type of person that will eat nearly everything, and cannot think of any food that I don't like.  I'm going to continue my search for a \"NATURAL\" TRUE pumpkin extract; however, this is definitely not it.  I hope this helps you, especially if you're as passionate about pumpkin flavor as I am.

Then you have to add water.  They give you a fill line, but it's kind of awkward.  Then microwave for 3 minutes.  Then stir, then microwave again for one minute.

My dogs did eat this food at first, but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as their previous brand. After reading the ingredients of Beneful, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. I try to avoid corn in all pet foods, and as a main ingredients is just ridiculous. Dogs are meant to eat real meat, they are carnivores. Basically dogs cannot fully digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging when they are not present in the food; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan.

After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.  Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.  I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.  My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.  UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a \"fair shake\", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a \"bad batch\" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat \"favorites\" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???  I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into \"fish broth\", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on \"fish water\" doesn't sound like a good deal to me.",

I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.

I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.

I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem. After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that! Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase.",

And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)  Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.

It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep-O-Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like \"conspicuously strong mints\" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re-flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep-O-Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint-O-Green or Spear-O-Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the \"new and [not] improved\" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their \"taste tests\" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.  MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear-O-Mint, which I also gave 5 stars] These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.  I hate sugarless products and the associated throat dryness that comes with consuming them. These are great tasting, sweetened with sugar, and also seem to act as an upset stomach reliever.",

            "input": "We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)  Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"  Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.  Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.  So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:    * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)   * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces   * a combination of the above two factors   * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract   o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease   o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation   o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage  Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.  Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.  Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.  When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.    The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.  The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining. Top  Bottle fed infants are \"a whole 'nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.  The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.  The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting. Top  Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:    * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.   * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).    Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:    Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"    \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"    For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.    * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.   * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.   * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)   * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)  Top  Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:    * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.    The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.    * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.  Top",

One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or \"best by\" date.

Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.  Amazon doesn't seem to specify \"use by\" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.

It has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time. It has deep red color, and looks very appealing.  It keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator. It blends well with walnuts, adds a unique flavor to beans, adds wonderful flavor to poultry, gives a nice taste to fish, gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables, and is a great tenderizer for lamb and pork.  I like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor (and beautiful color) to sorbets.  Ali Julia review",

It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us.",

Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the \"pegs\" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is \"buried\") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting.",

The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to \"spin\" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't \"Paw-centric\" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.  One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product.

My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed \"scrap\" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to \"re-label\" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!  I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the \"smaller\" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at \"perfect levels\" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever!

She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its \"food\". and the company who makes it basically said \"Sorry, but it sucks to be you\". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.",

            "input": "I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.  I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.  Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for \"Best in Show,\" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?  I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.  I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.  Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.  I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.  Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?  The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.  The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.   Karl and Lori  Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever.",

And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)  Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.  We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.  Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.  I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!",

Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first \"unofficial\" producers of \"we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker\" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.  Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.  As others have pointed out, there's a definite \"diet\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK\">Splenda</a>\" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.  \"Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want.\" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious \"diet\" sweeteners.  The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.  The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).  Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.",

I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.   I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this \"top shelf\" Stash.

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.  As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.  Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.  I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.  Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"",

With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick!",

            "input": "Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are \"drop \"biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.  About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.  The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.  The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.  I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.",

I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.  So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.  Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food.

Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.  Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.  The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.  The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.  PROS: Used grounds can be used in the garden Not bitter or acidic  CONS: Bland & forgetful flavor",

It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common \"fruit\" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.  It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of \"fructose\" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.  So another drink on the hit parade of \"pretend\" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.  You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.  Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water.

(25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle...

Finally, maybe I would find a less-acid-y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to brew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant.

At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds. I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste. Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the \"Switch\" carbonated fruit juice drinks. Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also. Both during and after you swallow it.",

Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article  Mozaffarian et al \"Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,\" The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006).  Here are a few quotations from this article:  \"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [\"coronary heart disease\"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. \"heart attacks\"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.\"  Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:  \"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.\"  They conclude  \"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.\"  Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook \"nutritional epidemiology\", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book \"Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating.\"",

The recent batch had cereal that had black/gray-ish flakes mixed with the regular-looking oat flakes, and it smelled horrible, almost like mold or really, really rancid oil. I had bought that batch from [...] and they promptly issued a refund. Now I'm a fix as to what to feed my baby! I don't want to experiment with an unfamiliar brand given how much he loves this one, but again I don't want him to eat what clearly doesn't look or smell like food.

First, I opened the package and smelled the coffee. It had the aroma of one of those motel room brews--the kind that aren't fabulous but will do the trick when you need some caffeine. Then I made the coffee in my Gevalia coffee maker. I sampled it black to get the true flavor. That flavor was ... burned. Even after adding a generous amount of liquid creamer, the coffee still tasted burned. Next, I gave some to my roommate. She put some half and half in hers, and she could barely choke it down. The coffee was completely unpalatable, and we dumped the rest of the pot down the drain.  While I like the idea of a low acid coffee, I cannot recommend this brand.",

In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.  My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.  Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.  But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils. Great for lavendar scented bath potions.  If you love it, give up on me in this regard. This is not a Sam-I -Am-Moment for the two of us. I would not, could not on one foot, in a bar, by a car, I will not, should not in cathedral, for a beagle or by that icosahedral.

I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of \"Switch,\" probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.  The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at \"carbonation\" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as \"carbonated\" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.  In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase \"Switch.\"  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it.",

About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.  Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.  I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.  If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.",

I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:  \"\"Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.\"\"  Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as \"unadulterated\" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.  I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.  \"\"What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.\"\"  If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.  Thank you for your time. -Amy  PS. I used to be one of those \"organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?\" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than \"oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it.\" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc.",

They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt/sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.  Cento sells many others, much cheaper, that are not these.

The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.",

            "input": "Riviera Sunset Decaffinated Coffee, from the Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection, is a good coffee for that first, morning cup of coffee.  It is a South American blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of Java.  The coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  The folks at Melitta know how to compact coffee for travel--all ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  Cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  The aroma was intoxicating--think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  The bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast (somewhere between a `full city' and European).  The bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you'd want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  This, I imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.  For some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  I'm not sure how they drink coffee in Europe, but in the US coffee machines measure by the cup.  This leads to a bizarre ~2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and (to my taste) a slightly weak cup of coffee.  In spite of the grind, I'd stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  Your intuition should serve you well, and I'd stick with your usual measurements (I'm one of those `heaping' tablespoon per cup guys).  The coffee definitely shows its South American origins.  In spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than I imagined it would be. Given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. Still, it is a well balanced South American blend.  It lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  Although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.  This is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  This coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer--a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those Torani syrups (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2QS\">Torani Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>) for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  It also makes a great iced coffee.  If cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. (I did not try using this in an espresso machine as I do not have one, but I don't think that it would yield a great espresso.  Concentrated, I think the acidity might become overwhelming.)  All in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  With a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee.",

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.  Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.  I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.  Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",

I could only make two perfect 7\" round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3-4 pancakes. The pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review.

Looking at the ingredient label did I realize it has more chemicals than other brands.

For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list \"color (blue 1)\" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.  July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color \"blue 1\", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!",

However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you.",

I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly. All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.  3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.  I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars.",

Everyone has their favorite flavor (i'm no exception -BBQ FTW!) so I recommend trying the variety pack first.  I thought I'd have at least one or two flavors we'd 'hate', but no.  My initial purchase of an alternative snack was Stacy's Pita Chips in Parmesan Garlic & Herb.  Nothing against them, but they lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.

You can't go wrong with these if you're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor.  2-ounce bags are about double the size of the kid's bags; about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks. It's really a good size for an adult.  It's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips, but it has 300 calories per bag. Again, not too bad, but something to think about.

The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value.

I was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle. I snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink.  I had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago. Only to find out when I got home that they didn't sell the canned version at my store. I was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online.  I have tried the other brands. This is by far the best. It could be because it's in a glass. I'm not a high end taste tester but I just know there is a big difference. And this stuff is like wine...best served when chilled. So being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world. Guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled. I'll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck. I'm a foodie. I love savoring food and beverage.  A lot of people are mentioning it's over priced. Compared to what? And if you notice it's not Amazon selling it, it's a distributor using Amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it. The free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case. They could reduce the price but then it would probably say $10-$15.00 for shipping. It really would not make a difference.  But I'm happy it's at my local health food store. I'm not ready to buy this by the case. Woohoo. Thanks, Taste Nirvana. This really is \"Happiness in a bottle.\" Go get your own. I'm not sharing ;)",

The tea-leaf flavor itself is quite nice - the subtle flavor of South Carolina's black tea is interestingly different from what I drink on a daily basis, and I like that change every once in a while. Also, the tea leaves seem very fresh.  I like the Governor Grey and Breakfast teas for a simple, linear-tasting black tea, but there are still other brands I gravitate toward for more complexity (Mighty Leaf has a wonderful Earl Grey with stronger bergamot flavor).  The problem with this particular tea is that the peach flavoring is strange and sometimes reminds me of chemically scented plastic (a warning sign of artificial flavoring).  I did double-check to make sure the \"peach flavor\" mentioned in the ingredient list is natural, and the website for the Charleston Tea Plantation affirms that a natural essential oil is used in all of their teas, but the peach tastes so chemical compared to other, more natural teas I've had - you know, the teas that have visible bits of fruit in it.  When I checked the reviews on the Charleston Tea Plantation website, I noticed that someone else had left a review mentioning the same chemical taste.  This tea is refreshing and easy to drink, but I just can't get over the weird peach aftertaste that lingers just a bit too long and too strongly.  Maybe it's just a personal preference (many other people seem to love this tea), but I'm going to stick with Green Hill Tea's peach apricot loose tea because it is much better, and the ingredients seem better (taken from their website: black tea, natural dried papaya, freeze dried peach + apricot, blackberry leaves, sunflower + calendula petals, natural flavours).",

They've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking, but they're a lot healthier than chips or crackers, and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you're mindful of blood sugar impact. They're also great for the occasional mild tummy upset, since they're light and bland and don't require the preparation of other bland foods.  Try them with hummus!

I opened it and found most of the little creamer containers to be crushed to some degree, with the creamer leaked out all over the inside of the box. It had apparently been in this condition for a while as some of the creamer had thickened and adheared to the insides of the box in nasty clumps. At first, I thought perhaps I could check and save some of the little containers, but on second look, it was apparent I was wrong. What a nasty mess, and the worst part is even if I wanted to return this mess, I discovered it cannot be returned. So I'm appealing to you to consider refunding this horendous example of bad packaging. Until now, I've always been happy with Amazon and will probably order many other things down the road despite this incident, but I just think I shouldn't have to pay for such a mess.

But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.  He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.  I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part. He did leave scratches all over it, but hasn't yet managed to crack it.

Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise. -Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy-duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged. -Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half-dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market. -Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15-20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos/mini muffins type. -Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the \"potato\" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips/some doritos). NATURAL taste. I bought these on sale with a 15-20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash/trees on the gigantic box they come in.

I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!  Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.",

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",

I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.  I set out to brew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, \"ummm this is really good.\"  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.  Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love. However,it had a smooth flavor, but  a little richer than I like and I didn't seem to notice that it was decaf, that was a good thing.  It was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee.  Hubby liked it a lot. So I would have to say it was a winner, a good rich coffee flavor and a good price.",

They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them.

Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China.

But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient.

The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.  The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.  (Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)  So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI\">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?

I gave this product 2 stars because it did not aggravate my stomach in any way, so it did live up to its claim, but, the taste of the coffee was awful.  Since taste is subjective, I hesistate to dissuade others from trying the Puroast, but I have to caution buyers about the taste.  In my former coffee drinking days, I was never picky about brands, and I find the taste of the Folgers low acid coffee to be almost as good as their regular brand, so again, I would caution coffee lovers that Puroast, while it's definitely easy on the tummy, is not as pleasing on the palate.",

I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste - nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side-by-side).  If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet, don't buy them.  You will be very very disappointed.

Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.

When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.  Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.  So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as \"gluten intolerance\"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.",

It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.  I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.  The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.",

It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.  Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use \"natural flavors\" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called \"effervescent decaffeination\" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.  On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, \"Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness.\" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.  I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.  ****",

I smelled it, and it does(it's not very strong but does has the smell like when all the nuts or rice turn bad)! I smelled the \"Earth's best\" one I have and it smells pefectly normal. Then I remembered I got a Happy Bellies multi-grain cereal before from [...]. It had not been opened and expires on March 2010. I opened it right away and it has a VERY strong bad smell. It makes me sick for several minutes and feel like there will be something fly out of it! I was really scared! You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it. It makes me really upset and I want to give it negative 5 starts if I could. BTW, I submitted this reviw to [...] but they didn't publish it.

The only down-side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.  I usually don't go for \"miracle\" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works - this is the real deal.

At one point, my mom's sugar spiked to it's highest ever at 389.  She was so scared when she saw \"CHECK FOR KETONES\" on the machine.  Well, let's try baking bread and using this coconut sugar instead.  It has that same effect.  I was wondering if we could be doing something wrong.  Maybe we are using a wrong ratio to the table sugar.  My parents used the 1 to 1 ratio (e.g. 1 tsp coconut sugar = 1 tsp cane sugar).  I really had high hopes with this product specially for my diabetic parents. I researched high and low here in Amazon and other diabetes blog sites. I have read nothing but excellent reviews of this product and other Organic Coconut Sugar.  Please, if we are doing something wrong, let us know.  Give us some feedback.

I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.  This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new \"worst\" one.  FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.",

Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.

If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.

The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.  And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total.",

The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.

Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.  Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is \"imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.\"  All that said, taste is pretty good and the \"wet\" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).",

This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.  If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.

Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.  On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier.

I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.  They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.  My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it.

You don't feel you would get sick eating it, but you might consider using it as a torture on someone. I would ask my wife to try it, but I want to live.  There are other better products on the market that taste much better, power bars, etc.  Some people may question aguave being \"good,\" but I think it is better than staight sugar or corn syrup--correction--there is some evaporated cane sugar in the product as well as coconut sugar.

Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess.

I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.  The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.  My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:  RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99  Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.  I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED.",

            "input": "...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.  However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).  O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.  Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says \"O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.  Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try.",

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.",

I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box.

Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.  I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.  For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?  I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.  If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.",

The packaging isn't the best once you open it, but I have separate air tight containers which I use (as I imagine most coffee drinkers would own).  I prefer dark/bolder roasts, and I found that Community Coffee definitely fit the bill. My girlfriend didn't like it, claiming it was too strong, which further reinforced my belief that it was at the right level for me. I brew the coffee the traditional way (coffee pot), but also via cold brewing. I've found that the cold brewed version of Community Coffee far surpasses the traditional, heat-brewing product.

In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is \"decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods.\" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure. See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]",

I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored \"cake\".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.",

Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.  Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!  Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.  I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM\">Celsius®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG\">Celsius®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.  One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.

Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.  Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.",

Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink.

What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.  \"Real\" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend \"time-to-mushiness.\")  And certainly only the Kellog's product contains HFCS.  You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob's Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven't tried Familia (but I'm not crazy about the idea of the \"fruit flakes\"), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog's, but I'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.  I'm surprised Quaker doesn't sell a muesli product...  Given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the U.S., you'd think it would be a natural fit for them.",

One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa.

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.  Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.  We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.  The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.  Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.

That is NO longer the case.  Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a \"hot spot\" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an \"allergic reaction.\"  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!  Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.  In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.  It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.  ******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems.",

Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item. A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering. Anyone want some tuna? O well.  P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast!

Within a month of bottling the Pear Chablis our 30 bottles is down to 6 remaining. We have given as gifts and taken to get togethers. My only negative comment is that the starting Specific Gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines. I did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning...but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine. Anyway, the Pear Chablis is a nice easy drinking wine. It has an attractive label. I used clear bottles and the final product looks sharp. If you are looking for straight wines that are not sweet fruit flavored wines, check out the Vino Italiano kits. These also come with corks, foils, and labels.

The chocolate had clearly been melted at some point, with a muted color, irregular coating, sticking to the packaging.  These cookies were very unsuccessful and a great disappointment. My Dad loved the two types of Walkers shortbread cookies I brought to him, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQ18K\">Walkers Shortbread Lemon Thins, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLVI\">Walkers Shortbread Assorted, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, so these were much anticipated for a dark chocolate and ginger lover.  They were absolutely lousy and ended up in the trash.  The cookies were extremely chewy, sticking to the teeth, but I'm not sure if this is the nature of the cookies or simply the batch we received.  We opened each box, finding all cookies in the same condition -- messed up chocolate sticking to the package, cookies overtly sticky.  If I can find these in a b&m store, I'll update, but won't order online again. Trader Joe's triple ginger cookies have a better texture and taste so we'll have a piece of dark chocolate with those for the desired combination. I may try dipping those cookies in melted bittersweet chocolate, leaving an edge free for easy holding.",

            "input": "I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.  I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.  These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.  I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.  ****SUMMARY****  How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)  Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.  Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.  If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:  **POP CHIPS:** Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%), Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g  **BAKED LAYS:** Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%  So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.  I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.  At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.  (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO\">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )",

I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.  In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.  The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages.

My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same-day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!  I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS=1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.

They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.  I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.  Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.  I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.  I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.  For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.  This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.  All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.  I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.",

Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.  The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.  Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says \"Not a significant source of protein.\"  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.  I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.  Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.  To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.  I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way.",

I was getting Maxwell House Hazelnut, but this coffee is much tastier; and Maxwell House has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing Community's bolder flavored hazelnut.  You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder, but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer, nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.

After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).  This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.  Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.  The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.

It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear \"skin\" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce.

The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer.  The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them.",

That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.

My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.

Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said \"I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again.\" My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain.",

            "input": "FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES  When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.  IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE  Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, \"100 calorie packs\" -- 4.5 inches across!  WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\" & \"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL  2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES  BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES  As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.",

Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.  Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.  Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).  By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say \"no *added* sugar\", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying \"no sugar\" or \"no sucrose\" (table sugar).  disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.",

If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner.  Ingredients: 1-1 ½ lbs chicken breast cut into 1-2\" cubes 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt Salt 3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor/heat depending on your taste  1 (generous) tsp cumin seed 1 (generous) tsp mustard seed 1 small onion diced 3 cloves garlic diced 2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes 2-3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice ½ cup frozen peas 2-3 tbsp cooking oil Salt to taste  1. Add chicken yogurt, curry paste and about ½ tsp salt to a bowl; mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables 2. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot 3. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, stir.  They are ready when mustard seeds start to pop.  Do not let them burn. 4. Add onion and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Stir constantly or else it will burn. 5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize. 6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low. 7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through. 8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste. 9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.

After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.  CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.  PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.  Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.  Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them.",

It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.  The candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy.  If I place it in an airtight container, it remains soft, but I really love it as the texture changes.  The flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice.  I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.  Therefore, if you want your licorice to remain fresh, I'd recommend placing it in an airtight container.  I've also purchased the raspberry flavor but haven't tried that yet.

I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.  After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. \"Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds\". Dogster-com  Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!  At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.  In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.",

I took one reviewer's advice and bought some at Wally World at a considerable savings.  My first (and probably last) attempt was chicken breasts, chick peas and sweet onions in a slow cooker.  I poured on the seasoning as I added each layer (onions, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning) to the extent that I though surely I had overdone it.  The result was tasteless.  There was no flavor at all.  It's not that it wasn't flavorful enough, it was flavorless.  I confess that I grew up in a household where we ate \"world food\" all the time, we just didn't know what it was because we had no cable TV and there was no FoodTV back in the dark ages anyway.  I live in an area where authentic ethnic food is everywhere.  Maybe my taste buds are completely fried (I do like me some spicy hot anything!) but to me this has less character than a moderate sprinkling of plain old black pepper, which is no character at all.",

New Ingredients Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract  I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.

Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.  I just want to warn pet owners of this danger.

I was about to get on a 6 hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying - but juice sounded too heavy. I'd heard the rumblings about coconut water so I looked to see if I liked any of the flavor options - I can't stand mango and just about everyone adds it. I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a \"splash of pineapple\" so I figured I'd give it a go. The woman at the counter said \"are you sure you want that? It's $4.\" Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda. I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.  It's amazing. I was happy to find it on Amazon - as I'm definitely hooked. Since I have Prime shipping, it gets to me in 2 days (if I order it right, that is!) which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock.

I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.  I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.  \"Stacey\"'s review sold me on it:  \"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with \"meat by-product\" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be \"unfit for human consumption\". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered \"waste\" and packaging it up as \"healthy & nutritious\" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.  Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not \"sold-out\" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of \"aflatoxin poisoning\" from the \"healthy & nutritious\" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".  My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. \"",

The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as \"illegal\" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that \"coca leaf\" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  [...]  DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.  If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.

My experience is what made me turn around and realize the truth about this product: 1. INSANE cravings for more carbs. You will want them whether it comes from this product or junk. That is because a carb is a carb and regular store bought/ restaurant style/ vending machines/ cafeteria food/ etc will not use this product. You will seriously slip in your will power.

Atkins gave me the clearest skin ever. After a week of this product I had tiny zits all over my face! Unacceptable!  Considering the expense of this product, it is not worth paying for.

Since I'm not a coffee snob I don't like to get crazy with the adjectives, but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor. Full-bodied is a good way to describe it, as opposed to a lesser-bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it. This is definitely the best coffee I've ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster. It has no aftertaste and it is not bitter. You can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it, or add some cream. Even if you go heavy on the creamer it doesn't lose is flavor. Buy it, and ignore the starbucks haters.

First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon). First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge. For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix.",

First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.  Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.  Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.  At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee.",

Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.  I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.  Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.  Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.  Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!  Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them.",

            "input": "This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.  I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.  If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.",

As a result of this habit I find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. As a general rule I prefer an Arabica bean but I could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. Curious I checked their web site and found they use the Arabica bean exclusively.  On the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the Rivera Sunset coffee; the Swiss water process is used. Their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: \"Unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water-soluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. The water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. This decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. Finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting.\"  More information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; I found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out.  Another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; I've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee.  Let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. First it is very smooth and rich; I almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. That is very rare! The coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which I found pleasing.  I did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. After working on it for several minutes, I had decided I was not going to let a bag beat me, I discovered that I was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. Once I got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. Fortunately the two small tears I made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. The bag recommends storage in a refrigerator.  This coffee is pleasant and refreshing and I have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think. I hope you're as pleased with it as I am!",

We hope we have assisted you correctly.  Thank you.  Kind regards,  Julie Mrs Mays  ------------------------------------------------------------  I've read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops, Communism, and carbon footprint. To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.  I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.  Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it.",

As others have said in the reviews, she couldn't get the treats out...she knew they were in there, but they don't come out easily and I put in her smallest doggie food.  Heck, I couldn't even get them out unless I pulled VERY hard on the rope.  She likes the rope, but not for long...she'd like it better by itself.  I got the smallest one and she's a very smart dog, but it's just not for her.  Don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...just put it in her toy box I guess and hope she latches onto it once in a while.  It's a total waste of money in my opinion.  She likes the roller treat dispensers...I even made one myself with an empty plastic peanut jar, used an exacto knife to cut holes on two sides, and she can roll it around and get excited about her treats rolling out...even an empty butter tub can be used.  Save you money on this one.  Just MHO. Update:  My puppy is now 11 pounds, full grown and will be 1 year soon and STILL cannot get the treats out of this thing.  I even have a hard time getting them out....I have to pull the rope HARD to get anything out.  Then I noticed my pup chewing on it and she was chewing the bottom off and, by the time I noticed what she was doing, she had it off.  She GOT the treats, but I threw the thing away....total waste of money I think.  Not MHO this time....experience!!",

This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.

There's not all that much root per teabag though, and since I like strong coffee I only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. Then with some cream and sugar it's quite good.  As for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. I don't know about that yet, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from drinking this. I feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that's as far as I can confirm the effects.  And with even decaf coffee containing 5-15 mg caffeine per serving, this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine.

For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the \"sweetest\" ones she'd ever had.  However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).  Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).

So, I recommend this, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting some Chebe too and cutting the Bisquick with it.

I made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as I always do. It's surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. Still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though I do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. (There's really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told.) It's as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee I've ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesn't seem to be an issue here. Ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so I'd suggest using it fairly quickly, but that's easy to do with a 10-ounce bag.

The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!",

This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.  I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.  Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.",

Are you game for a little challenge: Get three 3rd graders, heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons, green, yellow and orange.  Now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains, \"carrots and lemons\" or if your brave enough for a real acid test, \"lemons and carrots.\"  All I am saying, is give 3's a chance!

Although I'd love to give him human food all the time, I know it's not good for his digestive system, and it doesn't have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. Upon trying various brands including Blue and Call of the Wild, I couldn't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. After reading some positive reviews here on Amazon for Newman's, I decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after I poured some into his dish. He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US-made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. Newman's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. Will be buying Newman's as a regular!",

I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else.

For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste.

Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.  While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely \"natural\" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.",

Pretty much anyone else can easily skip it, however, as the taste and smell are both frankly supbar.  Clearly other reviewers have enjoyed this coffee, so individual taste reactions may vary, but I'm baffled at why this is advertised as being less bitter than standard coffee. It has a very strong and unpleasant chemical taste that is significantly more bitter than nearly any other coffee I've had in recent memory.  This may not be an issue for everyone, but it's worth noting that the Puroast low acid variety doesn't create that wonderful brewed coffee aroma at all. You have to put your nose directly next to the cup to smell it at all, and then the result is an off-putting chemical scent to match the flavor. Having my kitchen fill up with that distinctive scent to let everyone know the coffee is ready is a major part of the coffee drinking experience, and this brand doesn't offer that.  It seems like Puroast may be an acquired taste, but after four cups and trying the coffee both black and with different creamer options, I certainly didn't acquire it and can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious heartburn problem.",

Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product.",

The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again - Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor.",

The buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14 4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again.

What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so \"out of this world\"? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G\">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6\">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: \"Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!\" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.  The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.  One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.  My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO\">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee. The Don Francisco 100% Colombia Supremo coffee is still the best I've ever tasted -- at any price.  'nuff said.",

If it did, a lot of us would be happier--not thrilled but happier. You need to read thru all the comments to understand the prob. Keurig has changed the pumps in their design at last 3 times in the last two years but the problem isn't the pumps; it's the valves.  The most reliable way to unstick the valves is to remove the water tank, unplug the device, hold it upside down over the sink and give it a goo whack on the bottom. Really this works. If you think that's an ok way to operate a device that costs this much, then this machine is for.  More recently we've heard that Keurig support is telling folks that they cannot get a refund or replacement under warranty anymore because too many machines have been returned. Not honoring warranty? I don't see how that's legal. I can believe they are overwhelmed with returns, but that's the cost of business when you sell a bad design, keep selling it, keep insisting it's just scale build-up, keep refusing to continue selling the product.

It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.",

            "input": "I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.  The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.  The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.  My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!  My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.  I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!  I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.  If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.  I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.",

Today I received the email notice that my Subscribe and Save order had been shipped and that the charge for this item was $16.10.  Since that is $0.67 per can (and I can get it locally for $0.40 per can), I wondered why I would have signed up for Subscribe and Save at that price.  I checked my account and discovered that my original (on February 3rd) Subscribe and Save order had cost $8.49; a good deal at $0.35 per can and no sales tax.  The Amazon price has now almost doubled.  Now I've learned to check the prices of my Subscribe & \"Save\" items more often and cancel when necessary.  Regular checking is essential because Amazon doesn't include the current Amazon price of the order in the \"Order Shipping Soon\" email.  Most incredibly,  the \"regular\" Amazon price has ballooned to about $0.79 per can, which is almost TWICE the price of the same item at my local pet store.  No, this is not a good deal.",

Copied from FDA web site.  FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products November 18, 2011  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.  FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.  Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.  FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.  FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.  The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]",

Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.  Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.  The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.

It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.

Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.  I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.  Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!",

First, the smell upon opening the bag of Puroast dark French roast was underwhelming to say the least.  It was nothing that I could attach an adjective like \"rich\" or \"inviting\" to but rather made me think \"what an odd aroma for coffee.\"  Not a good start.  The quantity in the bag seemed small in the filter so I brewed with 10 cups of water and not 12.  I think it was a good choice because I could still see too much light through the brewed coffee for my taste.  And speaking of taste, I found this coffee to have an ash like character.  Not rich, smoky or full bodied like I anticipate a French roast to be.  The aftertaste is unpleasant and really lingers.  Overall, not a good coffee experience.  Because taste is subjective, I will mention what coffee I find tasty so you can get an idea of what the other end of the spectrum from Puroast is for me.  Peet's Major Dickason's and Ola's Organic Uganda Bugisu are two of my favorites.",

I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don't particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger's bags.    They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I'm not any kind of coffee expert, so I don't know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.    Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.  Jerry",

After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the \"astronaut\" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.  Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.  It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.  With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product.",

I, in particular, am not at all fond of Starbucks and their coffee, and the best I can say to describe this coffee, would be to compare it to Starbucks' most bitter blend... and then some.  If you were to ask only my taste-buds, they'd say \"no thank-you\"  ...but as far as acidity is concerned, this coffee is spot-on.",

The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!",

When I asked for the percentage of cranberry juicr in the product, she said that she did not have that information.  When I asked where I could find out, she said she didn't know.

It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.

That said, the small mini's are the first time that we have had a problem (PROBLEM) with about 1/3 of them being moldy or having mold on them.  Storage has not been an issue.  When we got them (within 1/2 an hour), they were placed into the freezer until use.  As we use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave (for a quick warm-up).  However, still I am fearful each time I rip into a small package, that I will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookie.  This is, obviously, not conducive to enjoyment while eating them.  We have NEVER had this problem with any of the the big cookie variety.  **UPDATE:**  02/15/12  - Today I opened my door to find a box sent to me from Erin Baker's... and it had 2 boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis (the exact amount that I had found to be moldy in my original order).  AMAZING company.  Check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about.  TOP MARKS to this company.  Not only fabulous breakfast cookies, but amazing customer service (which THEY volunteered - I did NOT ask for!!!)",

When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.

No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  \"It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth,\" one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.  There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?  But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 \"recycle\" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.  Bottom line?

If you were alive in the 70's, you know that Shake n Bake is a pre-made coating you put in a bag along with your meat.  As you may have guessed, you shake the bag, then bake your meat.  It's simple, and it's a low fat alternative to stovetop methods that need oil or butter. But the result is pretty pedestrian.  The coating doesn't crisp very well; it was downright mushy in spots, and the 'spices' in the mix were bland bland bland.  Pork is already low fat and bland.  It needs a little bit of fat for flavor.  I don't fry any meat, but I do sautee my pork chops (coated with Panko & my own spices)in a splash of olive oil , which makes them moister, tastier, and crunchier.  To me, the baking just didn't work well.  Maybe if the SnB coating was actually, you know, flavorful, it would have helped.

First batch was way to bitter for me, didn't even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker. From that next batch on, I became hooked on this brand. I don't like the price, but love the taste.  That conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall. If I tinker with taste as I also add assorted coffee-mate creamers (also something I am not allowed anymore but REFUSE to give up), the taste goes to a 5 for me. Even with all the discounts if I order through the subscribe & save program (see below), I find this a bit pricey.  ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  UPDATE: December 4 2010:   It still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very 1st Vine Program Item I ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me. As a result, I raise my review from 4 stars to 5 starts. Another thing I like is I have no decaf \"aftertaste\" that I always experience with other brands. It is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing (for ME anyway) that I can still really enjoy, that helps me relax in the middle of all this can't eat this, can't drink that \"stuff\" going on in my life the past 6 months. It's also the time I haven't felt like I was compromising good taste for good health. For that, I am truly grateful. Just ordered the 3 pack on the AMAZON Subscribe & save page.",

However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldn't do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store.",

            "input": "I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set-up area, are flexible for size/shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high-lining, tying to the trailer, etc.  There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component-by-component rundown on the items in this kit.  CHARGER - This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less-than-stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on-off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.  ELECTRIC TAPE --  This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½\" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4-5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre-installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.  STEP-IN POSTS - These are my favorite kind of step-in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set-up and take-down easier.  CORNER GUY LINES - This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set-up and take-down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.  WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC -- Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12\" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.  CARRYING BAG - Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap-off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble - one of the step-in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy-duty fabric, but not quite heavy-duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)  All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to \"contain 4-5 horses \", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time.",

After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).  The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.  Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.  My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.  I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.

I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.

I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.  -Taste  +Unsweetened: ++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring. ++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down *I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.  -Sweetened ++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor. ++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.  -2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.  Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.  I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back.

After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.  It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.

As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china. I find that pretty incredulous, considering the claims on the packaging about all natural and even free range. Definately beware!",

They are just as delectable as ... well... any popular chocolate-sandwich-with-cream-center-cookie you can think of :)  When you compare them, they are slightly larger in serving size (2g bigger), and still they have about 10 fewer calories, the same fat, sugar, and carb content, but 25% less saturated fat, three times the fiber, and are MUCH more nutritious (loads of vitamins, minerals, etc). Plus, you don't HAVE to eat 3 cookies, you can just have one or two (good luck).  Everyone who has come to my house has asked to try one, and they went crazy for them.  If you are craving something sweet after a meal and still want to put good things into your body, you will absolutely love these cookies. Delicious to munch and no weird after-taste whatsoever (unlike the WhoNu chocolate chip cookies).  Just sweet, chocolatey, Oreo-esque yumminess.  I will say, though, that I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why they're so expensive on Amazon. Maybe because they're not in every grocery store yet, so, when combined with shipping, Amazon can get away with charging a little more?  Who knows. I know I bought them here for convenience, and I'm so glad I got three boxes.  I know you can find them in ShopRite or WalMart for around $3.  Wherever you end up getting them, enjoy!",

The shipping label was attached directly to the SINGLE pastry box (rather that being affixed to a larger cardboard box that could possibly hold two) and said BOX 1 of 1, so I know it wasn't a delivery service problem.

I thought this was a little pricy, and could not easily determine how big of a package this actually was, but bought it anyway.  We got the candy after a few days with Amazon Prime, but when it came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The package (not shipping material, but actual bag of candy) was in battered condition, but not being punctured, we kept it. The candy itself was very stale - and exactly like Circus Peanuts candy (just a different shape/color).  In short, go for the $1.00 package of circus peanuts before spending $10 on this.

Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didn't work because they couldn't provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.  Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8. Software: Garage Band. Mic: Shure SM57.  Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.  Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap - it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.  For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4.",

            "input": "This kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.  I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.  The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can't get them into rock hard dry ground, but that's not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you've probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.  The kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1/2\" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.  The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.  The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.  I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you're glad to have the option.  The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It's a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.  The hook for the gate isn't quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you're counting on the fence never being touched, so it's not a big problem.  The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.  This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence.",

The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.  Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.  By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings.

So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them.

I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.  I wanted to love this stuff -- oh well. --- A month later I have come back to re-rate this product.  I have about 13 packs left out of the initial 20.

These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.  These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!  These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.  I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.  I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.  Buy some and enjoy them today!  SMILES",

Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere.  I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a \"chaser\", following a heavy-duty breath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.  I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.

The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for \"White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,\" \"Green Tea Papaya Nectar\" and \"Green Tea Sugar Cookies.\" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.  ~The Rebecca Review",

Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.  Better Than The Rest  I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.  Complimenting Flavors  Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means \"seeded apple\" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.  Brewing  I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!  Conclusion  Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!",

There weren't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans, which I've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats. The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild \"spam\"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that's why I heavily seasoned it. Don't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why!

In short, you don't have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you--despite the \"Fruit & Nut\" flavor--have to be a little \"fruity\" (to quote Norman Bates' audible thoughts in Hitchcock's \"Psycho\") or a \"health nut\" to find these tasty and nutritious--maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so).

Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.  I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as \"PB2\" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again).",

I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.

The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.  Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample.",

My next thought was....\"well, as soon as I bite into it, the thing's going to explode into a thousand tiny shards. I was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been. These crackers really hold together nicely.  The flavor is very plain. There is no seasoning, and very little salt. they taste like the grains they are made from. I have ordered a case of the \"Garlic\" flavor and look forward to trying them.

I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice.",

The second container I opened (again, same packaging, and good expiration date) had a totally different color - this time it was brownish-green. However, the worst part was the rancid smell.  It smells like rancid oil.  I opened the third container - same brownish-green color and and same rancid smell.  Very unhappy with this product.

It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?

If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.  Why eat a nutritionally empty \"100 calorie pack\" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??  I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.  Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:  Calories 80 (10 from fat) Total Fat 1g Cholesterol 35mg Sodium 15mg Total Carb 0g Protein 18g Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg  You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says \"in water\" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.

I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.  The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple \"100 calorie\" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.  My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.  These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat.

They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific. I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled. Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.  I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.  I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, I'd have just got a second bag of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158\">Hi I'm Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce</a>.

Recently at a friends house we were having some various crackers with a little butter and when I asked what the first cracker was, I was presented with a box of Kavli Crispy Thin crackers. The only way I've tried them so far is plain, buttered or with homemade cranberry jam and they're hard to put down.  I was a little surprised to see the other reviews bringing up the healthful aspects of these crackers as the two main reasons I love them so much have nothing to do with anything other than what I want out of a cracker - light, crispy texture and delicious flavor!",

The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.

Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store-bought soft cookies out there.  In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind-blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth-watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).  I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money-saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.  The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!",

            "input": "I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.  WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.  Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed. But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!  Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )  I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me! These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours (paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)  The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:  Potatoes Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil), Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey), Rice Powder Sugar Salt Onion Powder Tomato Powder Paprika Torula Yeast Garlic Powder Chili Pepper Citric Acid Cayenne Pepper Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour) Natural Smoke Flavour  Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!  Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key. Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production  As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!  Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )  These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE, are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!  Flavoured potato PERFECTION!",

I sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area. They sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order. The replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter-in-law.  In hindsight, I should have contacted The Spice Lab before I posted the review, so they could have had time to resolve the problem. I had jumped to the conclusion that I'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement, which wasn't the case.  Since it's a gift, I can't speak to the quality of the salt, but I can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive, and the little spoon is a charming addition.

When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!",

The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste.

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.  As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.  I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.",

Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake/waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.  We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.

It's difficult to describe....it's too bitter and way too sourdough-ish.  My trash can now smells of beer from the the sourdough packet.  If you like a bitter beer that you need to chew then by all means go for this mix.  The aftertaste is indescribable.....very bitter and medicinal. At $5 per loaf this is way overpriced.  My advice:  Keep a jar of sourdough and make your own.",

But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t-discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo/Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: \"New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!\" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t-disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!! It's a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as I drink this day after day, I'm starting to think it's even better than my old favorite Starbucks flavors. It's as bold as Starbucks with no bitterness at all. I'd love to hear what others think of this. I am very pleased with it, and I'm so glad that I am able to go back to the simplicity of using my Tassimo brewer, because they make a great t-disc again!",

I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped.

I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled.

Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.  These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.  As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.  Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.  I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA\">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.  Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"",

I made decorations 3 days in advance (which I've done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they weren't drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi-dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, I'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time.

She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.  Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.  I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :  \"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.\"  They ended their response with this condescending comment :  \"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.\"  After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The \"Canidae Team\" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.  So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.  I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?",

Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.  The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.  Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.  Not recommended, sorry.",

Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.  There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills.

He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to \"encourage\" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly.

Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.  I also like that it's organic.  I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.  Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.  Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.  Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.  Enjoy.  Mir",

They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left.",

The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.

The \"truffle essence\" put in this and other truffle oils is a synthetic ingredient, whipped up in a lab, that mimics just one flavor of truffles. The aftertaste this (and any truffle oil) leaves is chemical. In order to make it work in a dish, you'll have cover it with garlic and other seasonings: basically, hide the flavor.  There are some oils available through Amazon in which actual truffles are infused, but the problem is that oil doesn't easily absorb real truffle essence, so the presence of authentic truffle flavor is very weak and nearly undetectable.  If you like this artificial flavor, then the price is right ($). But if you want real truffle flavor, get the real thing ($$$).",

I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means you'd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldn't drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know it's not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid.   I was very disappointed as I thought \"yeah\" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.  Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park. I have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesn't,t turn cloudy when I boil it.

The pack comes with 12 big T-discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee. This coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts.  Update: I am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me (changing from a 4 to 5 stars); it is quite tasty and smooth. This is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that Sbux left. There will be some that will say that this is not the same as Sbux and it isn't!

Over the past 10 years, since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant, I have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad I ended up feeling like I might as well be eating the box!  This Bisquick mix is by far the best I have found for making scones (plain or sweet) and biscuits!  The Orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones I have made were delicious. It was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, I found I can play around with this and don't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  Of course, you can't roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  I have found that if I don't make it too sticky, I can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. I have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza (be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan - I use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesn't stick). Bisquick Mix is made by the Betty Crocker company and this, along with the Betty Crocker cakes and brownie mixes, allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again!  I have Bisquick Mix on Subscribe and Save, which makes it very affordable and makes sure that I don't ever run out!",

That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.  It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.  They all taste awful to me and they give me a reason to keep going with my diet so i never have to consider drinking these again.  So yeah they help, but the worst tasting drink ever in my opinion.",

But its claim that it will convert any \"condenser\" mic, even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power, into a \"plug 'n play\" USB mic should not be taken at face value.  I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).  So, if necessary, give it a try--and more than one.  But make sure there are return privileges.",

You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",

My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff.

I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.  My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food.

Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.

Each dog treat is scored to break it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2\" X 1-1/4 inch and quite thick - about 1/2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a \"treat\". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on \"Newman's Own\" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again.",

The Riviera Sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don't want the real thing. It had a nice, rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste.

Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.  So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called \"Eight O'Clock\" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.  My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.  Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better.",

No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else- there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself.  The hinged clam-shell of the K-cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track.  This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow.  The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew. Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere. Just Google Keurig hole problem.  It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed.",

I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:  #1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and #2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.  Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.  Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum  Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).  That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.  Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.  Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for: rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store), sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) , potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store), baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials), salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's), xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).  Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.  Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their \"mix\" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.  I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.  MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!  Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.  Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).  To find the recipe, do a google search of \"betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.\"  Boo on Betty Crocker.",

I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand.

When I arrived home to get the package, it looked like UPS played kickball with the package. There was a big dent in the box like someone stomped on it. Luckily, the tree survived. Since, I have been taking extreme care of it. I water it every Sunday. I give it indirect sunlight and sometimes take it outside on the porch for fresh air. I use a spray mist bottle and mist it once in a while to make sure to clean off dust, bugs and other things.  Other than my disappointment in what I got, I am happy to finally have a tree that I can take care of and watch grow.",

The brewed coffee didn't smell any better as the kitchen was filled with a smell like a dirty ashtray. The taste is not better. I dutifully drank three cups so I could give it a fair assessment, and the last cup tasted as bad as the first. I even added a spoonfull of chocolate powder to the last cup to make it palatable. That only helped marginally.  I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It may be low acid and make one's tummy feel better, but it's a big price to pay for the comfort. Now I'm disappointed that I still have a little of this stuff left. Definitely don't recommend this flavor.  Why didn't I give this foul tasting brew one star?

He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.  At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally.

The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.  The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt.

The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor.

Could you please define the word \"rich\" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full-bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.  It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.  I would reason that the fact your coffee costs \"4x less than Starbucks Via\" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself \"Taster's Choice\"  Who's choice?  A zombie?  Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes \"the smart choice\" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice!",

It just doesn't add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.

Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.

However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six-inch tall pill bottle with the 1/2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it --i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1/4\"H x 6 1/2\"W x 1 1/2\" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1/2\" inch long) foil packet is just under 3\" long, less than 1/2\" wide, & 3/8\" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat-poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.  Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed-ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.  In a (presumably) unconscious self-satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says \"Still Hungry?\"  Well yes, and I know several people who would answer same if they ate the entire box of bar-lets, particularly if they'd been expecting something appropriate to the size of the box.",

However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!",

Aside from the fact that I don't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.

It was getting so bad, that I figured I'd spend the money and try one of these sprays knowing that the reviews for pretty much all of them seem to be split.  I figured I had nothing to lose.  So I applied as per the labels instructions.  I did not have any issue with the spray damaging any of my flowers or plants and it did seem to work initially.  I had almost a week with no new damage. There was also no rain of any note that may have washed it away.  I don't think the rain since has washed it away either though, as I can see a residue on some of the leaves on some plants that were sprayed and left high up in a place where rabbits couldn't get to them.  Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived. Again I was coming home to check on my plants and finding more bitten off leaves and decapitated lilies. I stopped checking before leaving for work because it would put me in such a bad mood every time I'd see more \"victims\".  I just hate spending almost $20.00 for something (I was so desperate that I paid the extra 3.99 for 1 day even though I am a prime member) that in the end did not work as it should have. I just planted replacement bulbs for the 22 of 25 lilies that were beheaded and now I am here looking for a different kind of rabbit/small animal repellent. It's difficult to choose, as again it seems many products work for some and not for others. It looks like I was just one of the unlucky ones with this product and I'll try something else and see what happens.  Good luck to you all.

Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.

This appeared to fit the bill, so I bought a six-pack!  Pros: 1) Easy cooking - Very easy to cook, finished in under four minutes, and requires no additional materials (except about a cup of water). 2) healthy - is fairly healthy (all things considered). 3) Contains meat - this is a debatable pro, however I've found it difficult to actually find microwave meals (that require no refrigerator/freezer) that contain meat. This does, although not very much... 4) Acceptable serving size - given that the base of the dish is rice, the serving size is acceptable for a light lunch. I certainly feel full for most of the afternoon if I eat this meal with an extra snack during my lunch hour.  Cons: 1) low-average flavor/taste - I've definitely had better microwave meals (even microwave easy mac beats this). I usually love sweet and sour, but this flavor profile tastes more like an artificial pineapple flavor fused with minute-rice. I will not be re-purchasing this item solely based on it's poor execution of flavor. 2) Uneven rice texture - The base of this dish is quick-cook rice, and the method that Healthy Choice chose was basically rehydration of cooked rice in a microwave. The result is unevenly cooked rice with either too firm or too soft texture. 3) Very sparse serving of veggies/meat - despite the fact that this meal contains veggies/meat, the size of the serving is very sparse. Whether it was to cut production cost or to cut caloric cost, the result is a very meager portion of flavored rice with bits of processed chicken/veggies.  All-in-all, this meal has some pros that I was really looking for in no-fridge/to-go meals, but the cons just outweigh them too much. I won't be purchasing again.",

About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",

I would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday, \"You always smell so good.

I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1/4 as thick.  My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his \"treat\", looked at it as if to say, \"You've GOT to be KIDDING!\" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.  I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.  They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.

Years ago \"Grecian Delight\" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.

So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.

Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.  Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.  You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.  Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.  Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.  Enjoy!",

I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.

I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix.",

It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.  TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.  BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.  VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.  Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just aren't there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.  Save your money",

He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Baby's only for making an excellent product !",

The dark roast Eclipse, Mexican, and French Roast were very good. I made them into ice coffee, strong but not bitter. I didn't care for the Costa Rican light roast, it had an artificial taste to me. The House blend was good but nothing to write home about. I hate decaf so I used that K-cup to water my plants with, so as far as taste goes I have no idea but my plants perked up.

I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the \"natural flavor,\" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidson's responding to my (and other customer's) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.

The grind is very fine,  my cheapo coffee filters let a little bit of the coffee through.  Use good quality filters with this coffee.  It was difficult to open the package, and the little wire closer fell off after the second time.  However, I understand why coffee is packages this way, to minimize the exposure of the oils in the coffee to air. And of course a fine grind has a larger surface to mass ratio, making it age even faster.  So I forgive them for the packaging.  You really need an airtight opaque container to store this kind of coffee.  Personally I like to grind my coffee right before using, but the convenience and taste of this Melitta  has convinced me that there are other options.",

I was looking around and came across these, \"natural,\" flavored bones and thought.... \"SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!\" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.",

Kofinas simply tastes the best. Also, since it's sources from one area, I'm not worried about any other oils being in my delicious extra virgin olive oil.

She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately.",

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.  McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.",

Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.  Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body. High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers  1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity 2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes 3. Hypertension and Elevated \"Bad\" Cholesterol Levels 4.  Long-Term Liver Damage 5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS  Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon. Excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat.",

This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing \"straw grabber\" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper.

SOOOooo, before  I wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, I figured Id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. It TOTALLY has a pretty strong bitter after taste. :/ And , like another reviewer, I had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener (I dont like things very sweet, at all) but its DEF not. As I re read the ingredients I realized there isnt ANY sugar/sweetener in this mix so, youd def NEED to add sweetening. But, overall, I dont even plan on taking this mix that far. Im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. Thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... Id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... I hope the company works on this mix.

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.  Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.  A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione \"produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung.\" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.  Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.  Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.

Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by \"that other chain\" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.  With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.  So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.  I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.",

I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That brings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.  This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high-fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.

Their response:  ********* Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas. *********  I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.

I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!  If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.

Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.  This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.

I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.

Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.

It's almost got a bitter taste to it -- even Splenda didn't help much.  Unfortunately, I ordered two boxes and will be lucky if I get through one. Guess I'll sell the other one on ebay or something. Dunno. What I *do* know is that I won't be drinking it.",

Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.  On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.

He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work.",

I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, \"normal\" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.  This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.  My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!  I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good.

What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers.

Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.  If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust.

Our son was on Enfamil Lipil from September 2007-September 2008.  He was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  Our daughter, who is due in January 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  We tried two other formulas with our son--Similac Advance and Parent's Choice.  The Similac was fine but clumped badly.  During the time we experimented with the Parent's Choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  I think the Parent's Choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  I believe that Mead Johnson's decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  Our son had colic/acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  He was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little Culturelle (a probiotic) in his formula in the evening.  And since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the Culturelle.  Probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.  Regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, I talked to an Enfamil customer service representative who told me that Mead Johnson now uses cans that are lined with a \"modified polyester\" that is bpa free.  Similac Advance Earlyshield comes in a bpa-free can also (the SimplePac container).  Another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  Name brand formulas are expensive!  But if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about $15 a week (a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks).  $15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  And with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available--Bill Gates couldn't buy a better formula than what's on the shelves at Target or Wal-mart.  If you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store (as I was in September 2007), I suggest starting with the flagship formula of either Mead Johnson (Enfamil Premium Lipil), Abbott Laboratories (Similac Advance Earlyshield), or Nestle (Good Start Gentle Plus or Good Start Protect Plus).  They are all excellent infant formulas.  You just have to see what works for you and your baby.",

As for me, I don't think this is worth the money.  Here are my test results:  My 2 year old grandson loved them.  The 6 year old rejected them handily. I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below. They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that. They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking for  But: They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs. They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.  Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.  I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one. I find them filling enough to be satisfying. The grandsons love them and everybody is happy.",

I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.",

This tea was also quite cheap at Whole Foods, only $3.99 for organic tea.  I have paid twice that for better tasting, BLACK, organic black tea.  I'm pissed at the burnt flavor and red color.

I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.  The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.  The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.  I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really.

If you are concerned about your health, may I suggest you do this research and get the facts about this man made, very high fructose syrup?  I believe it is better to have all the information available to weigh against the agave industry's partial truths.  One article even suggests that current agave syrup labeling does not conform to FDA requirements.  The consensus of non-vested conscientious science is that agave syrup is another bad guy.

If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something \"healthlier.\" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).  I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.  I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.  I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.  There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.  The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.  I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.",

My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't \"play\" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.  But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.  My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding.",

I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.

The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.

Even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in, with the tape flopping, - must say the shrink wrapping has held, and the bottles themselves haven't spilled a drop of the water.   We're on our third case of  it right now, and very happy with this purchase.  The water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape.   About weight  of these bottles commented upon in another review... I thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes, I do drive a few bottles to work in the car, I don't backpack them.  Not a really obvious difference in weight, though, I think. Maybe necessary for shipping?    Guess it's like choosing sleeping bags...if you are using a vehicle, you can  use a heavier sleeping bag, so they tell me.  Anyway, I think you'll like this water, and you get 30 bottles per case, instead of the usual 24. We plan to order more.  We're glad we can do this.",

So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.  I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her. I can't return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isn't like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they aren't surprised and disappointed like I was.",

A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.  The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's \"revenue recognition practices.\" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.  A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.  Not recommending this at all.

It's better than chamomile tea, which doesn't do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything.  I've used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in.  When even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much, this goes down nicely.  But if you're not a fan of vegetable soup or celery, this might take a little getting used to.

I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I haven't been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos.",

Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.  I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!  I love using my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011528S0\">Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold</a> for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0T2\">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)</a>and filter cone (similar to this one:<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S\">Ready Set Joe/Mug</a>) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.  Take time to \"bloom the grounds\" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).  Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.  Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!",

So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing \"accelerated testing\" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).  This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.

I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K-cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K-cup is shaped differently from the traditional K-cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work.

            "input": "I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.",

I found the quality just like Patrick said. I too think it \"feels almost fragile;\" And, \"I also used...a mic cable\" because for me, that seemed the most sensible solution because I didn't really need it to move it. So, I mounted the connection to my desk; And now I move it very little. Aside from the \"no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it,\" on the gain knob, i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk. That would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship. Hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put. Anyways, great product but I guess, \"Thats what... he said?...\" Regardless,  Pros: Does what it says. Get it if you need it.

Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.",

It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.   This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.   The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.",

I found the carbonation level to be satisfactory, but I felt the so-called Kiwi Berry flavor could be summed up in one very technical term -- Yuck! Not only was the flavor bad going down, it left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (34g), sugar (33g) and calories (135). My overall opinion of this product is the same as it was for the Black Cherry variety -- i.e., it is not worth drinking even for free (as I did thanks to the Vine program).

He loves his dinner & keeps It down. ( full disclosure, he's not the dog with stomach problems.  Our Boston Terrier, who we adopted from a puppy mill situation, eats by gulping down her food, from her years when she had to fight for food.  She is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food; she was having a problem with vomiting & regurgitation.  The good news is, if we get her to eat 2-3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down, problem solved.  Yet, if she eats fastly, without chewing, regurgitation is still a problem.  I gave the food 4 stars because. If we do make sure she chews it ( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time, like giving treats) the food stays down, therefore working for vomiting, which was a huge proplem! (she was vomiting 6-9 times a day.) since switching she has stopped vomiting. I don't think our dog is the only one that eats fast, and it does take much longer to feed her.",

After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.  We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.  After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.  If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?",

Second, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and, third, that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup (I like to use a mixture of milk and cream).  The fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper - two things that ruin clam chowder for me.

I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.  Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?  As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.  I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except \"sweets,\" of course.  My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!

No, but after moving to the South some 25 years ago, I have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere.  I will say that most recipes I could find must have been for some cheap tea bags (weak, somewhat tasteless and bitter), so I experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea.  The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  If you are in a hurry, fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice.  This works great for this particular loose leaf tea - not strong, not weak.  Oh yes, if you like sweet tea, add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot.",

We usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade, crystal light, or tea and drink it down quick before it expands. Flaxseeds are loaded with minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and fiber. They are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation.

The Dark makes a great mocha, just do half a cup of the Dark Cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee, add whipped cream on top, delicious.  Also worth noting, you can try some of the flavored coffees in your Mocha and rustle up some great combos. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, i struggle to drink a cup but as a Mocha, delightful.  Drinking the Peppermint or Milk as a hot chocolate, we add a little milk and whipped cream on top, delicious.  I highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it. :-)",

These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.  Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.  I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:  Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is \"sweet\" BBQ. Everyone else loved them. Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags) Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter. Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag  I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.",

Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a \"so called good brand name food\".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today \"Friday\" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.   Linda",

This blend is WEAK, it can't hold half-and-half or even just whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I brew it on the \"large cup\" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't hold a CANDLE to any of those.

She tugged it a couple of times when we first gave it to her, but it made so much noise she has never messed with it again. I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds.",

These are hard to remove when frozen and you end up touching the other sections and contaminating them. You have to run hot water over the section you want to remove. You cannot see thru the lid if you put different food in a container. These are way too expensive when you can buy the other Fresh and Freeze by One Step Ahead that can go from the freezer, microwave then the dishwasher.

I love the idea of an all-natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium.  Whenever I am hot, thirsty or a little run-down, I find that Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple really quenches my thirst, refreshes me, and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in Gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes.  An 8-1/2-ounce serving  has only 60 calories and 30 mg of Sodium (less than fat-free milk), with 515 mg of Potassium and 180% of the RDA of Vitamin C.  It's a little pricey, but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping, it's a great value.  Although I have previously purchased it on Amazon, I more recently bought it at GNC during Gold Card Week when there was a free shipping offer and a \"buy 2, get 1 free\" offer.  With a deal like that, it breaks down to less than 65 cents per 8-1/2-oz serving.",
