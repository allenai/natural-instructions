I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.\n\nM wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. \n\nM proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying \"of course you dont know, because you never look.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?",

Anyway she hasn't decided yet but is thinking about a destination bacherlorette party...so it would be flight from Canada to that city, apparently a small gap of time then flight back to her wedding city but not enough so I can fly back home in between so it's looking like lots of unpaid leave. And it's just after Xmas next year so pricey time to fly.\n\nSince she got engaged she's been saying things along the lines of \"start saving for my bach party\" and \"we gotta save for the party\". I let her know these kinds of comments are super stressful for me as I have other savings goals and I'm doing my best to save for her thing too, but I am feeling unhappy financially.  She responded by basically saying she too has savings goals (her parent is paying for the whole wedding) and at least I'm not a homeless person like what happened to thousands of people in California. I just told her again i wanted to bring it up that telling me to save makes me feel stressed and anxious. She wrote it on the official bridesmaid invitation that I needed to save for her party and I mentioned how I didn't like that and she was like Oh so that's all your remember about my gift?! \n\nIt just runs me the wrong way and I think it's crazy tacky to tell people especially people struggling financially to save for your destination bacherlorette party.

I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA?

Our \"side by side\" last two hours\" and nearing the end of the time I realized he might be hitting on me a bit with the laughing, general comments, and him trying to get me to join a singles group in our area, so I dropped a comment as casually as I could about moving here and getting a place with my boyfriend, to avoid embarrassment on both parts.

I wouldn't be hurt by him not talking to me, but i found it odd him staring at me and brushed it off at first as maybe a crush, a few weeks later, I mentioned something to my cube mate, and he mentioned that he'd noticed Greg staring at me. It's been two months of him staring at me and at points changing his route to the bathroom to come check me out at my desk. I feel very uncomfortable and Stressed.

The whole day i was stressed worrying that everything went as planned and when people started arriving i was kinda distant and anxious.Then my GF came and we went to the restaurant but she could tell i was really panicking about the whole thing. She asked me what was wrong and i told her i was having a panick attack from all her friends being there and worrying if something could go wrong (she really didn’t gave a shit) So i order a couple of beers so that i could calm down. Then the bus came and i was even more stressed and drank a couple more drinks in the bus. Then my GF screamed at me in front of all of their friends that i should stop drinking. I got pretty mad and basically went to the corner because i didnt want to talk to anybody. Then she looked at me while i was mad and pretty much ignored me the whole trip which pissed me off even more. She gave me her phone and i dont know why i looked through her chats and i saw she was texting her ex. I didnt look any further and it got me even more pissed off. I gave her a text unloading me from all the frustration so when she saw her phone she’d know whats up with me. She looked and didnt even care. So when we arrived i was basically devastated. I didnt know what to think or what to do i just wanted to get out of there. So without thinking i called an uber and got out of the house like a ghost so i could go to the nearest park to load off some steam. I ended up crying because i imagened the worst.

            "input": "So this past summer I (M 22) was looking to  buy a new car and upgrade from my first car I’ve had for about 7 years. To not go too far into detail about it, my dad got involved in my new car purchase and coerced me to go against my better judgement and buy this 2006 bmw that he found online for about the same price instead of the one I had picked out and was going to buy (2007 Volvo S60 R) which, might I add, was in perfect condition. When I looked at the bmw it seemed to be in decent condition apart from some obvious problem areas that I knew would need to be addressed (new wheels, appeared to be an oil leak, needed new driver side headlight) which also gave me a bad feeling in my gut. long story short I end up buying the bmw cause my dad went ahead and out some of my money in as a down payment for it (he likes to eat involved with things). \n\nOk so fast forward about 6 months and I have so far sunk about 2000$ into this car on necessary fixes that turned out to be big repairs (I’m still kicking myself in the ass for buying this money pit). One thing in particular that still hadn’t been fixed was the driver side headlight. The problem with it was that water had been able to leak into the headlight over years and years causing the clear plastic to be permanently cloudy and also messed up some electrical components which caused the adaptive headlight not to work (turns the lights left and right when going around corners and is a very intricate assembly so can’t be fixed with a simple bulb replacement). Since I don’t have a lot of money being a recent grad and am only working an entry level job, I can only make the repairs once I save enough money and the whole replacement OEM headlight assembly would cost about 5-600$. \n\nAlso for a side note I’m big on doing things correctly the first time and of course I’ll try to save money when I can but I will opt to spent the extra buck when something really counts and needs to be done right. \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago my dad gifted me a replacement headlight assembly so I could save the 500$ for something else. The other day I took the old one out and tried putting the new one in. First I hooked up all the plugs to make sure it worked but there was one plug that didn’t have a spot to connect to. I looked closer and realized that these were not the same kind of headlight. The main difference being that the replacement did not have the adaptive headlight assembly inside it and was just a regular bulb (the light from the replacement was yellow and much dimmer than the original passenger side light that was white light) On top of that, the holes for the screws didn’t line up right with the frame and required a little persuasion to fit. Also on the original there’s a separate arm piece that clips into one corner of the headlight and then is screwed into the frame. The replacement had the spot where the piece sits in but not the part where it clips into the headlight itself so it sits in the opening loosely. Without this arm attached, the headlight wiggled around. So now I’m thinking that the replacement is just a cheap knockoff. I told my dad about the light and that as much as I really appreciated his gift I can’t use it cause I’m worried about it coming loose or breaking (being as that it wouldn’t be completely mounted and the material felt very fragile) and he acknowledged. So I figured I’d just take it out and put the old one back in the next day as I was running out of daylight and didn’t feel like fiddling with it anymore (kind of a pain in the ass to get it in/out) \n\nThe next day I get up around 10 cause it’s a Saturday and It’s the only day I get to sleep in. When I go downstairs my dad tells me that he was able to get the headlight mounted correctly and that he fixed it. When I go out I see that the arm is attached to the frame on the spot on the light where’s it’s supposed to be. I look closer and I see a big crack in the side of the opening where the arm sits and super glue all around it (looked like he forced it in and it snapped). Then I see a big smear of superglue that dripped off the arm area onto the front of the headlight onto the clear plastic that had been partially wiped but looked like it was wiped off a bit too late and managed to dry. So now not only can I not return the replacement headlight because it’s damaged but I’m pretty much stuck with it. I told him that I appreciate him trying to help but as much as I tried to not get mad I got pretty upset at him doing things to my car without my knowledge. \n\nAITA for trying to give my dad back the gift and getting upset with him about him “fixing” the replacement and rendering it nonreturnable?",

We frequently have movie marathons at my house but they almost always get cut short by her mom sending her a text like “Be home by 9” on Friday and Saturday nights, saying things like how my GF needs sleep, among other reasons that don’t really add up. My girlfriend obeys her mom without any argument, and I get her home at the specified time, no questions asked, but this has happened for so many dates in a row that I’ve started believing her mom just doesn’t want her spending time with me. \n\nI didn’t say anything until today after my girlfriend texts me saying she needs to cancel our next movie marathon that we planned days ago because her mom decided today that it’s going to be a family day, which was kinda the straw that broke the camel’s back, per say. I asked her if her mom didn’t like me, I got a kinda flakey answer, which make me go into a bit of a rant about how I felt that her mom didn’t trust me, was making up random things to cut our plans short or interfere with them entirely, and how I felt rather insulted by it. My girlfriend didn’t really say a whole lot other than her mom wouldn’t change so I would have to learn to deal with it and that I can’t take is so personally, at which point I apologized because I realized I was bothering her.\n\nThroughout some more conversation I apologized repeatedly, and my girlfriend said it was fine about 4 times until she finally said that she didn’t like me talking shit about her mother like that, that it really bothered her, and that her ranting about her mom is different because it’s her mom.\n\nWe’ve resolved the fight and it led to some very healthy discussion, but I’m still wondering AITA?

It got to the point where I felt sexually harassed, and I started telling him to “shut the fuck up and leave me alone, asshole.” He went away after that.\n\nNow it’s at this point in the story where some of you are gonna say “just tell a teacher,” and yes, I agree, that would be a great thing to do except since he has autism, unless he physically does something to me, the teachers won’t do jack shit.\n\nAfter I said that to him, the next day, he started saying that he was going to get me expelled from my school because I was a discgrase (bad spelling sorry). I had enough at this point so I started messing with him a little bit. I went along with his game, and every time he would say something about me being a bad kid, I would go along with it and make up stories about being a criminal. (My favorite was telling him I was a time traveling bank robber.) other than this, I didn’t say anything insulting to him. \n\nOne night, after a concert, his twin brother who doesn’t have any mental handicaps told me to stop messing with his brother or he would beat me up. I stopped after that and just avoided the kid entirely. \n\nI know it’s been like 4 years, but this still sticks in my mind. I really don’t know if I was the asshole in this situation so I’d like Reddit’s opinion.\n\nThanks for reading. Let me know if I should put a TL:DR",

This whole week he has messaged her (even did it 50 times in 10 minutes) blaming her, getting angry at her, swearing, talking about jealousy of us (we don’t see each other TOO much outside of work). He was bothering her for days, interrupting her at University and continuously crying and blaming her for the sexual assault he committed.\n\nI texted her last night after she left my house (we watched the last episode of Hill House) and told her that the relationship seemed abusive and he was manipulating her.

I suspect some of you may know of this restaurant, in which case you realize how difficult it is to get a table.\n\nWhen we are finally sat down my goal was to treat her to a meal, and then proceed with the breakup after the fact.

I’m going to call him Jeff for this post. We met in middle school and ended up going to the same high school too, but we had an extremely rocky friendship (even longer story so I’m skipping it) until the end of my sophomore year when he convinced me to join a club at our school. We started hanging out a lot during my junior year, and I developed a crush on both him and my now-girlfriend about that October. I had come out to him two weeks previous and he was chill about it, but I knew he was straight so I figured if I asked him out, he’d just reject me and I could move on with my life since that avenue was entirely closed and ask out my current girlfriend instead.\n\nTo my surprise, he said yes anyway. The way he said yes should have been my first red flag. He said, “Well, you’re a dude, so I won’t date you, but we can be friends with benefits.” Now, I was stupid and felt validated and was shocked so I said sure and we made out in his car. When he took me home after that, I felt weird, like I wasn’t really myself? It’s hard to describe, but I found myself staring at my reflection in the mirror and feeling off for a while that night. I brushed it off at the time, but it’ll come back up later.\n\nOver the next two weeks, he slowly warmed up to the idea of us dating. These are the next red flags. He asked me if he could call me his girlfriend, which I was so...weirded out that I was left speechless. We also did a lot of semi-public making out and third base which made me sort of uncomfortable but I wanted the relationship (one that I felt I barely could even have in the first place considering the circumstances) to work so I didn’t say anything and just went along with it when he’d ask to make out for an hour in his car or for me to give him a handjob.\n\nEventually my own anxiety caught up with me and I impulsively broke it off that December. He seemed crushed, as he was finally developing romantic feelings for me, but the addition of romantic pressure to what I recognized was mounting discomfort with physical stuff (particularly because the dynamic of the physical stuff made me feel like “the girl” of the relationship) was too much for me so I nipped it in the bud to save myself.\n\nIf only I had listened to my gut and my raging dysphoria.\n\nHe ended up dating a girl pretty soon after and I started dating my current girlfriend for the first time (our first relationship was pretty dry because we were both pretty awkward so we broke it off after a few months, but we’re extremely happy and almost at 6 months going strong this time around!). However, after we had both broken up with/been broken up with our SOs, he asked me if I wanted to try a relationship again in June. We had been best friends the whole time we were broken up, so it wasn’t hard for feelings to be rekindled there and I agreed.\n\nThis time he upped the ante sexually and every single time we hung out he’d ask for some sort of sexual act, usually a blowjob but sometimes more. He’d also ask me if he could do things to me that made me extremely dysphoric (touching certain parts of my body for extended periods of time and using certain language) and I’d tell him no repeatedly but he’d still ask almost every time we hung out. Our relationship continued into my senior year, which worked because he was in college but living at home. We only saw one another on weekends, time that became unspoken “his time” with me.\n\nI barely hung out with my friends outside of school functions that year because all of my weekends were taken up with Jeff. He didn’t have any friends at college (this probably will come off as biased but everyone I’ve known from high school agrees that he has a weird superiority-inferiority complex that leads him to not give people the time of day if they’re not “smart enough” for him) and his high school friends largely went elsewhere except for two of them.\n\nMost of our time in person and over text was taken up with him talking about his interests and his financial problems with me just having to go along with the conversation and him asking for sexual favors (either sexting, which I was uncomfortable with, or actual sex, which I increasingly turned down out of the crippling anxiety/dysphoria it gave me and actual physical pain it caused me in some circumstances). Because I was in senior year, more and more of my time was taken up with college applications and big projects, so I started saying no to more and more invitations to hang out.\n\nI will admit that that’s not always the only reason I said no, as he was becoming clingy and demanding to the point where just thinking about the weekend made me uncomfortable. I tried my best to communicate my discomfort to him, to the point where I broke down crying on his bed trying to explain my discomfort when he kept asking me for a blowjob when we were watching a movie. After I finished crying, he asked me again and coerced me into putting his dick in my mouth, after which I broke down crying again and asked if he could drive me home. He did, and that was the last time we hung out, as after that I would both deflect for OBVIOUS REASONS! and also because AP exams were approaching and I needed to study.\n\nThe night before one of my exams, he texted me asking if I could come over. I said no, I was studying and had an exam the next day, but he then launched into a long message about how I was avoiding him and “he never had this much work in senior year and he had taken much harder classes than I did” (which may be true on some level as he was taking engineering classes, but I was still taking 4 AP classes, a dual enrollment math class, and an intensive film seminar where I had to make my own short film that was due in a few weeks, so the comparison wasn’t fair in my opinion). He threw out a few different arguments all with the intent to keep me from studying for an exam (including but not\nlimited to making fun of the college I committed to when it’s literally the same college he goes to!) I paid $93 dollars for just so I could give him a blowjob and cuddle him for two hours maximum. I had had enough at that point and told him as such and ended the conversation.\n\nWe didn’t talk much from there and two weeks later he broke up with me, citing how distant I was for the previous few months. As he was breaking up with me, he asked if we could “still cuddle sometimes” to which I said yes, mostly because I didn’t want to burn the bridge at that point, didn’t want him to be upset with me (as he had fallen into a depression in the past over ended relationships), and was riding the relief high of no longer being trapped in the relationship.\n\nFor clarity, I didn’t break up with him myself because I was too scared of disappointing him or at worst sending him spiraling into depression. He was still my best friend, and I cared about him, but I know my choice to sour our romantic relationship without talking to him properly was a very very bad one. I apologized to him for it the day we broke up and he seemed to understand and forgave me.\n\nWe broke up a week before prom, so I ended up going with a group of friends (he didn’t even want to go to prom so this was the plan anyway). It was a great night that I still remember well, except for what happened afterwards. My best friend who we’ll call Nina planned on having a get-together afterwards. We usually had holiday parties or afterparties at her house so this was normal, with the only difference being the very small number of people coming to her house this time around (only like 7, two of whom left before the sleepover portion and one of whom being her boyfriend who was on break from college). Jeff asked her a few days before prom if she was having a party, to which she said yes. No other words were exchanged - he didn’t ask what kind of party, how many people, times, and not if he was invited.\n\nAt midnight, we hear the doorbell ring. I’m upstairs in the spare bedroom (which is on the third floor, for reference) with my current-girlfriend and her then-best friend while Nina, her boyfriend, and our other friend are in the kitchen downstairs. I don’t hear who it is or know what’s going on until a few minutes later. Jeff and his friend are standing in the doorway of the spare bedroom. Nina is standing behind him looking EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he just stands there, smiling awkwardly and not saying anything.\n\nMy CGF asks him what he’s doing here, to which he responds that they were coming back from a metal show and decided to stop by since they were in the area. Keep in mind this is a private party, it was literally the middle of the night, Nina’s parents and sister were sleeping on the second floor, and he had shown up unannounced and with an additional person most of us weren’t really friends with. And he thought this was okay.\n\nHe doesn’t leave until every single person there expresses to him that they’re not going to speak with him until he leaves (apparently he had specifically asked Nina where I was so he could come talk to me, which he should have realized was weird because we hadn’t spoken sense the breakup). When asked about it repeatedly after the fact by me and other people, he refuses to see that he did anything weird, wrong, or otherwise.\n\nAfter that, talking was a bit awkward so I asked him if we could take a bit of a break from our friendship too, as I knew he wasn’t totally over me and I wasn’t totally over my own discomfort being around him (multiplied by that weird encounter after prom).\n\nThe longer we didn’t have contact, though, the more I realized that - not to be dramatic - I m",

She is sweet, but she is a little off. Overall, she doesn’t like people. She will come out and snuggle with you when It is very quiet and you are typically laying on the couch relaxing. The problem is that when you are not home, she comes out and lays on all of the furniture and pees on it. We have taken her to the vet several times and spent thousands of dollars on her. There isn’t a  medical solution, she is incontinent. \n\nFor the most part, she likes to be alone. My husband feels guilty that she is alone downstairs. But I contend that she has food and a safe space to live in a controlled setting where if she pees on something, that it isn’t a big deal. He is upset that I don’t go and spend more time with her downstairs to interact. I admit that I don’t do what I should,  but my husband doesn’t either, and his reasoning for not going down there is that “there isn’t anything to do down there”.   I told my husband that she is fine to come upstairs and be allowed to Rome around, if I can replace anything she ruins that she pees on. He then argues that I don’t have a realistic sense of smell. I feel really discounted by this given that I am miserable in areas the cat has been around.\n\nMy husband is seriously the love of my life but this freaking cat seems to come between us. Do I need to just accept the smell of cat pee? Am I being a total jerk keeping her In the basement? I love animals and want to make sure she is taken care of, but I am needing help from you guys in establishing what the line is. My husband discounts my experience in smelling all of the cat piss.

We all have girlfriends who come and go, but one girlfriend (M 19) lives with us permanently. The three of us guys pay rent out of pocket, while the girlfriend in particular (we’ll call her Amy) has a room on campus that she has never once slept in, and that room costs more than what she would pay to live here. She hardly ever visits her own room. \n\nAmy eats food that her roommate pays for, uses up utilities with us, uses our bathroom, etc etc. She doesn’t buy food. She doesn’t pay for anything, except for herself. This is typically fine, she can pay her own food and expenses. But she wastes money paying for a place on campus when it could make living at my apartment cheaper for both of my roommates and myself. Even she would pay less.\n\nThis is something I’ve never voiced to my roommate who dates her, because I know the girlfriends me and my other roommate bring over don’t pay rent either. The difference is they come temporarily and leave. Half the time they’re not here. And while they temporarily take up space and do the same things as Amy, they leave just as often to stay at where they live.\n\nAmy and her boyfriend knew prior to moving in that Amy would be staying with us full-time. She’s cool as a roommate, but she also takes up a lot of space, makes the place dirty, sits on our couch all day, uses our shower and bathroom constantly.\n\nMy parents wonder why I live with 4 people full time and three pay rent. It’s more of a burden for them when they help me in affording college, and it would make rent cheaper for the other three.\n\nThe main reason why Amy doesn’t pay rent, is because her parents don’t know she lives with a bunch of guys. Her, and her boyfriend, have no plan on telling her parents. I can understand, but her parents are also paying thousands every semester for a room she’s never slept in. Amy and her boyfriend would rather not approach the issue then pay less for where they’re living because their parents cover most of it. I pay out of pocket for where I live a lot of the time. It’s tougher for me, when I feel it’d be easier if she paid rent.\n\nI approached my roommate who dates Amy, and low-key asked that since he knew beforehand that Amy would be living with us full-time, why she didn’t pay rent this year. He maintained the fact that since there’s only 3 people on the lease, it shouldn’t affect me at all and it’s not my problem. If she didn’t exist it wouldn’t make a difference. \n\nIt’s a small apartment, and she’s constantly around. She takes up a lot of space. \n\nI don’t know, I’m really unsure if I’m in the wrong place even asking.\n\nAm I an asshole for pulling my roommate aside after several months this morning, and asking him why she doesn’t pay rent? \n\n",

Pre-kids, my husband and I had decided that we weren't going to do the whole Santa tradition.  What we didn't plan for was how hard Santa would be pushed in school (small town in an area that's 99.999% culturally Christian). Lots of Facebook posts from classmates' parents about not letting kids who stopped believing in Santa spoiling the magic for those who still believed.  The thing is, my daughter has absolutely no chill and can't keep a secret.  So when my daughter started talking about Santa and believing in him, we reluctantly decided to play along just enough to keep her from being the a-hole that \"ruins\" Christmas for her preschool class. \n\nFast forward to a few days before Christmas.  We go to a family function and within minutes of arriving my 5 year old niece tells my daughter that Santa isn't real.  Daughter asks me if it's true,  so I ask her what she thinks.  Daughter replies that she thinks he's real and crisis averted.  But later at the gathering, my brother-in-law (that niece's dad) boasts about how they don't do myths at their house.  It seems that when niece learned the truth, she wasn't taught that some people prefer to be kept in the dark.  I say nothing to niece or brother-in-law about it. After all, if I don't expect my daughter to be able to keep a secret, I can't expect her cousin who only a few months older to keep one either. And everyone has the right the raise their kids as they see fit.\n\nBut I'm feeling annoyed about the whole thing.   Both at being peer pressured into a tradition that we  didn't really care to do and for not getting the same consideration from our brother-in-law that we were trying to give to others.  So I'm sure I'm an asshole for being a hypocrite.  But I'm also wondering if parents who want you to lie and pretend to keep up a tradition that you don't follow are the assholes.

They were much older, had obviously been fighting with each other and were super agitated.

We sat in these people's sweltering living room or almost 6 hours (that's not a joke) and we weren't offered so much as a drink and when I finally said I'd like some water, the kitchen was filthy as were the dishes and the husband was so shitty because I took a bottle of hot Dasani from under the sink. \n\nWhen we left,  I lost it with my wife. I told her that was one of the most miserable experiences of my life and those were two of the most miserable people I've ever met.

When I’m in a bad mood or tired I make the food, get my plate, and head to my room. Usually a few minutes later I’ll hear them serving themselves and eating. No big deal. \n\nNever have I said “hey were are just making food for ourselves” or anything similar UNLESS it’s food that I’m taking to a potluck then I will let them know why I am making the dish. \n\nSo, every couple months my mom starts to look for fights with me. When I was younger we used to argue constantly, that was our relationship. But now that I’m older I just don’t care to argue as much. When she’s looking for a fight and I’m cooking one of the things she’ll do is ask “are we allowed to eat? / can I have some?” And I always ignore this question because I think it is unnecessary.  Usually that feeds the fire and she makes sure to tell my brother something along the lines of “here I’ll give you money to go get something to eat” or “are you hungry? This is just for them”\n\nSo, when it gets to this point, am I the asshole for ignoring my mom when she asks this? For me, it’s obvious that when I cook I make for everyone.  The only reason I’m asking is because she used my laptop a few weeks ago, and I saw a FB conversation she had with a friend saying that I was selfish for not letting them have some of the dinner I made so much of. \n\n",

            "input": "(Trigger warning - this is about childhood sexual abuse.  Don't read if you find it upsetting.)\n\n\nSeriously, if that sort of thing bothers you, maybe skip this post.  I was reading a post over on /r/legaladvice about someone who was abused by their piano teacher for a number of years and s/he is considering reporting the teacher to the police because the teacher is teaching again and they're afraid the teacher is going to harm another child.  In reading through the comments, I discovered that Colorado has no statute of limitations on prosecuting childhood sexual abuse (That is something that has changed since I lived there -- I didn't know this until yesterday).\n\nIn 1988 I lived in Colorado where my grandfather used molest and rape me (I was an 8 year old boy at the time) and my sister.  In 1990 my mom cut off contact with him and reported what he had been doing to my sister to the police.  I was too terrified to say what he had been doing to me because A: I was told \"This is all your fault.  I don't want to do this, you're making me\" (I have since gotten into therapy and do accept it was not, in fact, my fault) and B: because one time I tried to use a pocket knife to stop him from hurting my sister.  It didn't work and he just beat me up, telling me the horrible things he would do if I ever tried to stop him again or if I told anyone what he had been doing.  I still have a physical scar from it.  \n\nSo when I got stuck in therapy to see if he had done anything to me, I still thought it was my fault and I was still afraid of him.  By the time I could trust the therapist, she transferred me to another therapist and I felt I couldn't trust anyone.  That therapist told my mom \"The grandfather wasn't interested in boys, so your son is fine.\"\n\nJust my sister went to the police.  They interviewed her and gave my grandfather a polygraph test.  He passed the test (Something psychopaths can do very easily.  Fun, err, disturbing little trivia fact.) and the police declined to bring charges against him.  My mom tried to tell the rest of the extended family and they all turned against us saying she was spreading lies.  In 1992 we cut ties and moved three states away.  We couldn't do anything about him and we just had to move on with our lives.  I remember at one point looking at the laws and seeing that the statute of limitations had passed on what he did to me.  Not that I had any faith in our justice system to prosecute him, honestly.  \n\nI tried to heal and move on (Some days are better than others).\n\nThen I saw that post and read some commentators that said there is no statute of limitations for that type of crime in Colorado anymore.  That means I could report him.  \n\nI thought a lot about it, and I just don't want to.  I've talked about my history on reddit before, and had someone message me saying I was a \"little (derogatory word)\" for not taking the law into my own hand and going to beat the shit out of him.  I had lunch with a friend and he told me that I'm a bad person for not going back to Colorado to take care of this because he might hurt other kids.  My grandfather is now 90 years old.  Has he hurt other kids?  Maybe.  I try not to think about it.  I'd like to think he's now too old to do that anymore.  \n\nMoreover, I don't want to take revenge on him.  I don't want to send a senile, 90 year old man to die in prison.  Even if he is a heartless monster.  I don't know if I strong enough to travel back to Colorado for whatever that would involve (I still live three states away).  I don't want to deal with the inevitable nightmares of going back to confront him.  I called him on the phone once, and it didn't go very well (See my post history, if you're curious).  \n\nI just want to go on with my life, forget that bastard and just heal.  Does that make me an asshole?  \"Evil prevails when good men do nothing\" as the saying goes, but I don't know if I can do anything and I don't want to deal with the guilt of sending him to die in prison.  I know he'd be going because of his crimes, but I struggle with guilt and anxiety.  I know that it would eat me alive to know I was the catalyst that sent him to prison.  \n\n\ntl/dr; my grandfather used to rape/molest me 30 years ago in Colorado.  I just discovered that the laws were changed to remove the statute of limitations on child sex abuse crimes.  I don't live anywhere near him and I want to get on with my life and healing, not going back to Colorado to try and bring him to justice.  ",

He is...a man who has a title of Father to me. Did I loved him? I did...I don't recall calling him daddy ever since i knew the truth. I think it's disrespectful not to, but i couldn't bring myself to call him that ever again.\n\nHe is a liar, cheater, heavy smoker, gambler and quite an alcoholic. I think he is abusive... but I can't understand it...not violence... he did slapped my mom once and treats us like grass.\n\nI don't love or hate him. I don't want to hate him. If I do, I just keep suffering. I could still imagine myself having a cup of tea with him.\n\nI think I am a bad person. Too cold and heartless.\n\nI couldn't look at him without 'it' being calm. I avoid talking to him as much as I could, I avoid his family as much as I could. Sometimes, I want to torture them and kill them, but that's not me. I have mental illness. It corrupts me, though I try to keep hold of it. I just want to get out of here.\n\nI remembered texting him long ago, writing a lot of swear words. I hate you. \n\nYet I forgave you. I forgave someone who force mother to have abortions, someone who doesn't even want me from the start, someone who wanted to give me away and ruined our lifes and still hurt us.\n\nI feel...like i'm the bad one here. He took all my money that i was saving for school and a house ever since I was 11, maybe it's ok, right? He's my father...Mom asked him to pay for college or university if I ever able to get into one, he said no. ha..it's reasonable...?... But if it's his other daughter, why is he so willingly...to do anything for her? How different am I to her? Is it because I demand too much? Or is it he doesn't love me because i'm...a child from someone else...which was supposedly dead or is it because i'm not a boy?\n\nI have a list. I wrote what I want from him.\n\nA table and a chair. Piano class and art class, tutor , school , cheap drawing tablet, etc. Also have treatment about my mental illness, I don't want to do anything bad...again.\n\nHe earns 10k a month, but he refuse to pay treatment and always drag things so long. It been 7 years, in those 7 years, I should be in school and learn something. Honestly, it was my fault too. If I had just try to search for a school myself when I was 11, maybe I couldn't end up like this. Even so, I wonder will he pay for it? Last time I asked....he lied to me and i never end up going to a school for another year.\n\nI feel like i'm demanding him so much. But people are telling me they, his family, took more than we did. But still, aren't i too much? \n\nI just want to get a stable life and able to go school. Get a job and leave this place with my mom. I thought of bringing him along, but it will upsets mom. He might try to get me into something too...like mom said he did it to her. Get something from me.\n\nI thought of giving him money each month when I get a job. After all...he's my father and i'm grateful...he even give us money. It may be hundreds of dollar like 200 and expect us to live on that for the whole month, but it's still better than nothing.\n\nMom wants revenge. BY selling the house and leaving him. I...pity him, maybe I feel sad for him. I feel bad for turning a blind eye... mom said to not worry since he have 3 kids. But for someone like him, wasting all money on gamble and have little savings...I wonder if he is going to suffer. If he is...I feel bad. BUt there seems to be no way of settling these... he'll never listen and won't quit gamble if i recommend him to do so.\n\nAM I an A-H for wanting things and him paying for all of it and still leave him?\n\nAlso if you read all these, wow...I...thank you. I hope...it's not stupid. I'm nervous, very nervous while writing this. I think by doing this, i may get some advices from people.",

My Fiance is often frustrated with them because he feels they are \"narcissitic\" and they cause me to feel very sad or negative about things that should be exciting. Because of this growing up, I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety. I felt that if I went with them and found a dress, they wouldn't like it or they would be very negative about it. This is what led to me wanting to try on different styles of dresses without them. I wanted to figure out what I like, not what THEY like. \n     I did ask my sister (my maid of honor) to come with me to the dress appointment, and I also let my mom know I was going. My sister said she wanted to go, but she had to work. However, she did not feel like going to work, so she asked me to type a message to her boss to get her out of work, which I refused to do. Since no one else was available, I just asked one of my future sisters-in-law to go because I knew she would be supportive. \n     I tried on 6 dresses of all different styles at this fitting, but I just fell in love with the second dress. I was not expecting to actually find \"the\" dress at this appointment, but it just kind of happened. My gma had previously offered to pay for my dress, so I called her to the store to see it. I also called my sister, who was supposed to be at work. Turns out she only went to work for 2 hours, and got home around the time my appointment started. It was minutes from our house, she knew I was there and had the option to come. I told her I found something and wanted her to look. She was visibly annoyed, but she came.  I tried on 2 more dresses with my gma and sister there that I let them pick out. After those, they did say they liked the dress I found, and my mother, whom I facetimed, said she loved the dress and thought I should get it.\n     My gma got the dress for me. She seemed a little sad, but was happy I was happy. My sister mentioned that she was kind of hurt that I chose to go with my fiance's sister instead of her because she would have liked to see me try on dresses. I feel like she had the choice to be there, but decided not to come. \n     Now I am feeling incredibly guilty and selfish for how everything played out. My fiance believes that I gave the opportunity to come and look at other dresses and its their own actions that made it so they were not there. So, Reddit, AITA?",

During the time we were together, me and my family would give her gifts. I would often get her clothes from the store I used to work at.\nAnyway, about a two ago, I ordered a hoodie from a Chinese girl on instagram, at 400$. The hoodie came about a month later. Once it got here, I realized that the size was actually in the asian size chart, instead of american, so it didn’t fit me right at all. I call the girl and she tells me she could change it for me, so I wait another month for the hoodie to arrive, and when it does, the girl has the audacity to tell me that she can’t change it, but rather lower the price of the original by 10$, because the one she first gave me didn’t have a tag anymore, even though it never had a tag in the first place! So I just say fuck it and buy the hoodie for a second time at 30$, it just so happened that the day I went to get it, my ex was waiting for me at my house, so we started talking and I let her know about the hoodie and she says she’ll take it off my hands. Since I didn’t feel like making her pay full price, I told her I would do 30$ to at least make up for having to buy it again. She posts a picture of it on instagram and my dad happened to see, he then casually tells me “hey, isn’t that the same hoodie you bought like two months ago?” and I then explained the situation. He then scolded me and told me I should have given it to her for free (even though I used to make 260$ a month, so 70$ for a hoodie is a lot of money for me) so I call her up and let her know she could keep it.\n\nNow it’s eating me up, I’m not sure if I should have just given it to her to begin with or if giving it to her for 30$ wasn’t such a big deal. AITA here?",

Our relationship started off a bit strange and we did things that people who aren’t just friends should do, but both of us knew it wasn’t serious and it was never like super over the top or anything. I joined pretty late in the semester though and didn’t realize that Michael was close friends with a girl named Amy.\n\nAmy was dating Ben, but I quickly found out that Michael was desperately in love with her. They were best friends and always talking and he fell HARD for her. She would tell him that even though she was dating Ben, she and Michael were meant to be together, that she was in love with him too, that they would get married right after college. Michael, meanwhile, kept attempting to convince her to breakup with her boyfriend so they could be together finally. It was a shitshow and Amy’s boyfriend was aware this was happening the whole time and would mock Michael about it constantly. There was also a lot of evidence that Amy had two boyfriends (not Michael, it was another random guy outside of our university), but Michael was blind to it and supported her 100%. Anyways, eventually it became obvious that Amy was just stringing Michael along to get a higher position of power within the club. I convinced Michael that Amy was toxic for him and that he needed to cut her off and he agreed, although he didn’t really want to and Amy ended up leaving the club. \n\nA couple of months later, he called me and told me that Ben and Amy had broken up and I told him I was really concerned because I knew they still talked sometimes and he told me that he just wanted to be there for her because he had experienced a similar breakup in the past, but that there was no romantic feelings between them still.\n\nSure enough, a couple of weeks later I find out that they’ve started dating. I know she’s no good for him whatsoever and frankly, I’m tired of having to deal with all of the drama she brings to Michael’s life. There’s a lot more details about why I just don’t support this relationship or really want to be friends with him while he’s dating her, but these are the most major reasons. I sat him down and told him that I was going to quit the club for a while because I’ve become more busy with schoolwork and that I think he and I should stop hanging out or talking. I never specifically told him it was because of Amy, but I think we both know it is. I feel like shit because he seemed so crushed and even started crying, but I absolutely refuse to clean up after his relationship with her anymore and watch him suffer while he’s with her. She might also still have that second boyfriend. So, AITA for cutting him off like this?\n\ntl;dr: Best friend is now dating a girl who we both know is super manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive. She might also have a second boyfriend.

            "input": "So I'm married with a couple of step-kids that live with their mom and I. The older kid is doing great, but the younger (14) has gotten involved in some pretty bad things in the past year, including some illegal activity, as well as self-harm including cutting. Additionally, on two different occasions last year, including as recently as November, she purposely overdosed on medication but (thank heavens) regretted it afterwards and let us know so we could get her to the hospital. We now keep all blades and medications locked up and out of reach. We have of course been getting her the best help we can afford for her, including solid counseling and psychiatry evaluation. Her psychiatrist believe that she is likely bi-polar.\n\nAfter the second attempt, I noticed the patterns that start to emerge from her when she's likely to cause harm to herself. She exhibits heavy depression, wears extra layers of makeup (and much darker makeup as well), refuses to talk about what's bothering her when asked, usually denying that anything's wrong, pushes everyone away, and attempts to withdraw into the bathroom or her bedroom for a long period of time. This also seems to occur more often around times that should be celebrated, like holidays and family birthdays. So, twice since November I've noticed things getting dark and heavy with her, and decided to go on suicide watch. I'm probably not the most skilled at this, I've never had previous exposure with suicidal people or had any training or anything of the sort. Also, there seem to be a lack of information online of what to do in these situations (other than the stuff we're already doing). So as far as I can tell, I should make sure that I or someone else should be able to see her at all times, including if she's in her room, the bathroom, etc. I know we've done our best to limit her access to self-harm tools, but I believe she's also smart enough to hide some stashes of things throughout our (unfortunately) cluttered house so she can self-harm if she wants. So when I've gone on suicide watch these two times, I allow her to still go anywhere she wants. I do make sure that I or some other family member (especially if she's going to the bathroom) has an eye on her at all times. This makes my step-daughter angry to no end, yelling, screaming about how she has no privacy.\n\nLast night was the second time and was particularly bad. She was trying very hard to lock herself off in her room. I started by trying to encourage her to come out and be with the family, letting her know we really wanted her company. She insisted that she was going to do laundry in her room. I told her that's fine, but I would need to be in there with her. She freaked out and kept trying to argue with me about it. She asked if her aunt (who was over at the time) could watch her instead, and I told her that's fine, but I would need to speak with the aunt first to give her some instructions (such as make sure you keep an eye on her even if she's in the bathroom, etc). Step-daughter would not go for this, freaked out more.\n\nWife came downstairs and tried to help. She tried to negotiate with step-daughter, saying she could just leave the door halfway open and that would be good enough and we would be down the hall and come check on her from time to time. Step-daughter would not budge insisting that she had every right to have her door fully closed and be all alone. I didn't agree with my wife on this because I feel like she only needs a few moments to find a tool and do self harm, but I kept quiet and let her try. Step-daughter wouldn't agree to any of wife's terms anyways.\n\nEventually I stepped in front of her bedroom door so she couldn't attempt to shut it on me and lock us out, and then she ran out of her room bawling and up the stairs. I tried following behind her and my wife grabbed my hand and told me \"don't\". I yanked my hand away and I followed step-daughter up the stairs. Step-daughter got to the top of the stairs, turned around and bolted back downstairs to her room, with me following all the way. She slammed the bedroom door shut but I got it open before she could lock it and held it open. She then started hitting me with her fists while bawling. At this point my wife grabbed her and held her and her aunt stepped in to help provide some comfort, and I left.\n\nI'm trying to do the right thing here. I want to be safe and am not interested in violating her privacy or restricting her in any way other than when she's most vulnerable to self-harm. But my other step-daughter, mother-in-law, and wife all had some negative feedback for me. Mother-in-law and other step-daughter say I was scary chasing after step-daughter the way I did. Wife believes step-daughter should have been allowed to run up the stairs alone and been given some room to grieve in complete privacy. I disagree because I believe she would have locked herself in the upstairs bathroom or another room and potentially found a way to hurt or kill herself in there. I suspect wife thinks that my suicide watch is overly controlling and is in fact having the wrong effect, in other words that I'm driving her to more likely self-harm. I don't know if she's right or not.\n\nI feel like I'm in crazy town. I feel like I'm the only one on board with doing what's necessary to keep her safe when she's at the low end of her cycle. If I'm the asshole, or even if I'm not, I want to know what I can do better because I very much do want my step-daughter to be safe. Would definitely love to hear from some professionals or other people experienced with these sort of situations.\n\nSo tell me, Reddit. Am I the asshole?",

It seems like she doesn't comprehend the idea that people don't care about her stories or her anecdotes even though they visibly seem annoyed or bored with it. Last night everything ended up coming to a head. For context, I have a dissociative disorder that's typically brought on by stress. I run on autopilot and end up with a lot of my actual thinking being more drawn into trying to recover. When this comes up, I go off to do dishes alone to help recover until it's time for me to take a drive. She decided she wanted to help me out, and I told her \"No, it's fine.\" No one at my work knows about my condition.\n\nShe didn't budge, but I was in no position to argue as my mind began to disconnect. She started rambling, and I was tuning her out while I phased in and out of reality like I was an ethereal being. I was trying to ground myself. Eventually she poked me kinda hard and my body recoiled, I just stared at her like 'what the hell?' She asked if I'd heard her, and I shrugged, telling her, that I would if she had anything of value to listen to.

She proceeded to shove my shoulder lightly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decide it's time for the hard truth. I explained to her bluntly, that her touching me made me incredibly uncomfortable because she's my coworker, not my girlfriend. I went on to tell her that her anecdotes and stories weren't interesting in the slightest and that her obnoxious humming to the store music grated on everyone who could hear it. I finished by telling her that she wasn't terrible to be around, but that it'd be great if she was self aware enough to understand that people find her really annoying and if she could recognize that she'd be much more tolerable. I was frustrated with her, honestly, fed up with the touching and her constant babbling about bullshit that was always stacked onto stress from rush hours or from being incredibly tired and not wanting to deal with her. She just was so obliviously unaware of people despite the fact that we were visibly tired and vocal with our feelings. I just kinda let it all out on her and part of me felt bad because it was harsh, but I felt like it was necessary to make her understand.

One player in the group who has been a friend for years (henceforth referred to as R) constantly interrupts the game by talking loudly, arguing with my rules, and generally trying to get everything to go his way. Others in the group have complained about his disruptions as well, and I have had many conversations with him on how to improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to the current story. The session was already going awry because the group kept splitting off and fighting amongst themselves. I honestly don't care what their characters do, but I do care when the players yell and fight as it causes a disruptive environment. So R had been goofing off with another player, Z, all night. They sat in the corner and talked and didn't pay attention which slowed play down for others since I had to keep repeating myself for them. Z has really never been a problem so I simply told her to quiet down and she apologized (even though the behavior continued). R, however, refused to acknowledge what he was doing was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end of the night, I was fed up. About 10 minuted before the session was due to end, I tossed a marker onto the table which R then picked up and hurled at my face (probably trying to be funny). I was pissed. So I waited until it was his turn in combat again and told him to either pick up the marker or have disadvantage on the rest of his rolls (roll twice and take the lowest). He refused and another friend picked up the marker to avoid confrontation. So I then told R to either apologize for his behavior or have the same punishment. He refused and said he would continue playing without listening. I skipped his turn and continued playing with the others. He proceeded to quit the game and then sulk around for the last ten minutes (because his car was trapped between others and he couldn't storm out like he wanted to).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was ready to go to bed after dropping off another friend, but I instead came home to 15 messages from R.

He called me an ass/asshole exactly 7 times. He complained that I singled him out instead of dealing even punishments.

Making things much easier and providing us a good base to continue life together.\n\nThis year we've both been under heavy stress. Myself, I've been aggresively job hunting after graduation  for over 6 months with very little hope and just getting more and more depressed after each rejection. My ex-gf was facing stress from a grandfather who's been terminally ill for a year, with also lots of assignments keeping her busy at university.\n\nDuring our time together we've both known about each other's issues, but not how great the stress is for each of us. I was blind by her schedule, so I structured my tasks around her, so I could spend time with her hanging out, going out, going for walks n talks etc. In some cases, she did bring up her grandfather, and every time I'd listen and talk about it. However I never sugar coated it. I tried to voice my stress. Telling her directly, about rejections or how stressed out I am. But at this point she seemed go be already annoyed at me for reasons I couldn't understand, she would often play mobile games and not communicate properly with me, which was not like her.\n\nIt was 2-3 months after her arrival when she broke up with me before xmas holidays, stating the reasons being me and my family. For hurting her feelings, and not supporting her at all. She said that she would sit in my bathroom and cry in secret and go to a friends house to sleepover there instead. She also stated very petty reasons that I'm a bad boyfriend, in most cases a lie or an exageration. Her crying state made me fall for it and sympathise with her. She also revealed to me \"dark secrets\" that she has never told me about. She said she was suicidal since 12 years old and that before me she cheated horribly with her ex, threatening me that she would do the same to me if we went on for longer, she never spoke to me about any of these things, not even hinting.\n\nA lot of her issues, seem to stem from a time before I've known her. Yet in her final dialogue with me, placed the blame on myself. I haven't been in contact with her since and only known of her progress through mutual friends. Fixing out she seemed to have recovered, posting unusually Instagram posts with hastags of #happiness #positivity etc. Rather superficial in my opinion. I also found out that after returning to uni after holidays, she immediately went on a date with a friend she met there. So it's clear she moved on very quickly.\n\nI've left this relationship feeling incredibly guilty and sorry for her, as it really was an amazing relationship. We treated each other, and she admitted this, yet she didn't speak to me about any of these feelings she said she had. Seemed like she built up all the negatives and just burst by the end. I also feel very angry and resentful, as I feel I was betrayed. Opening my house to her, settling her in to a new city, keeping her busy with what time we had. I had my stress, and she had hers. I tried to talk about it, but she shut herself off. Am I really a bad partner, and a monster that she sees me as ?\n\nIronically, I acquired a great job a week after we broke up, with many benefits, prospects etc. So it's rather oddly timed, as a part of my life continues and another runs off. Certainly missed details, but it would get rather wordy and messy.",

We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask.

To be honest, her cat is kinda annoying and our cat isn't a fan, and I wish he didn't like us so much, but what can you do. \n\nAnyway, about 6 months ago I noticed her cat loosing weight, despite eating a ton of food at our house and at her house. Deduced it was diabetes. Mentioned to her he was skinny, kept hinting he should see a vet, even weighed him and proved he was loosing weight and still she dragged her feet about taking him to the vet. \n\nNow they don't make a lot of money, but enough for a vet, and plus don't own pets if you can't take care of them. Anyway she is aggressively cheap and I just knew it was about money so I offered to pay half if she took him to the vet. She immediately agrees, makes an appt, takes him to the vet, they run a bunch of tests and treat him for a few things, to the tune of $400. I pay my half as promised, with no expectations that she would pay me back. It was a straight up gift on my part.\n\nFast forward a few months and her cat is doing much better. Weight is back on and then some. Still spends 90% of it's time chilling at our house.

We are a group of 5 friends but this time Dylan invited a girl he recently met, I'll call her Emma. We had a bunch of different substances and planned on playing some (board) games and just having a good time.\n\nAround 9 PM I took a bar of Xanax after smoking a bit. I must say I do have a little tolerance to benzos so this didn't really knock me out or anything. Dylan decided to stick to alcohol this night and Emma took 2C-B for the first time. The others were smoking weed and drinking, my other friend (Brian) took a bar of Xanax too. \n\nWe were all having a great time. Emma was having the time of her life and could not believe what she was experiencing, meanwhile Dylan was already getting pretty drunk. Around 11 PM we started playing a drinking game. I had my mind set on taking it easy since I have blacked out in the past combining benzos and alcohol. Emma came to sit next to me and kept touching me and resting her head on my shoulder. I did not know how to respond to this and just let her do her thing. I know how intense and stimulating a trip can be and did not want to mess up the moment.\n\nThe drinking game went pretty OK. I stopped after 3 shots because I already felt that I was entering dangerous territory. Dylan on the other hand was getting absolutely hammered. Emma was playing it safe too and stopped after 2 shots. While this was going on she was still very touchy and affectionate towards me. Honestly I just didn't really know what to do. I've never gone beyond first base with a girl and felt conflicted. My friends noticed this and distracted her for some time.\n\nSomewhere between 11 and 12 PM I took another bar of Xanax. I know, it's stupid but I couldn't help it. I remember feeling pretty slumped and went to lay down on a bed in a different room. I slept for an unknown amount of time (0-2h) and woke up with Emma standing next to me. At this point I was still pretty barred out and she was talking to me. I didn't really care for whatever what she was saying and just closed my eyes again. This is where it all falls down.\n\nI think around an hour passed when Emma came to lie down next to me, and I asked her what she was doing. She told me she was just tired from the trip and wanted to relax a little, I believe she was close to the end of the peak. I think I was sobering up a little bit (could have taken another bar, not sure) and put on some relaxing music and tried to sleep again. At this point Emma was again getting very touchy and I just ignored and tried to go to sleep. I remember taking off my boxers and that's about it. I woke up around 10 AM with both of us naked and I left shortly after.\n\nI have no exact memory of what happened and tried my best to piece the shards I know together. After this I called Dylan and asked him if he knew what happened the other night and how he was doing. He told me he knows absolutely nothing but had a good time regardless. I don't know what to tell him, I feel like this would put an end to our friendship. I have seen Emma once since this all went down and she kept going with the same touchiness and attention.

My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus.

I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house.

Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.\n\nNow upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.\n\nNow here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently.

He said I could get him another gift card, or I could just get him nothing because he won't get me anything and he probably won't say thanks either. \n\nI immediately refused and said I couldn't show up with gifts for everyone but him, but then I thought about the facts that I talk to everyone but him, and if I can't face him long enough to give him his gift, should I be getting him one in the first place? Also, to be fair to him, he's seems very socially inept. He rarely leaves the house, and I've heard that he treats mostly everyone except his family the way he treats me, but it's never been confirmed. \n\nSo I leave it to you redditors, would I be the asshole if I showed up with no gift for the brother who ignores me?",

            "input": "So I Was going to a small party event filled with old white people. A dinner party basically but without dinner. As we were walking up to their house I was kinda nervous cause I’m bad with social interaction and as I was walking to the door I noticed the door was open. I live in Georgia so most people don’t have screen doors or glass doors in front of their actual doors. I assumed that I could just walk through and so I stepped normally into their house and I learned the hard way that their was a pane of glass on hinges in front of their open door. So I walked straight through it, broke my glasses, got 3 small shards of glass stuck in my hand and shoulder, got a massive cut on my head from the glass from my eyeglasses, and may have gotten a small concussion.\n\nWhile as the hosts came rushing over and I was apologizing/crying instead of asking how the bleeding teenager was doing they said “Our door!” \n\nWeird flex but...it’s fine I guess\n\nAfter about 10 seconds they turned to me and instead of apologizing or asking how I was doing they said “why did you break it” I responded with “sorry I didn’t see it” it was pitch black out, foggy, the door was a solid pane of glass with a clear frame, and they must’ve used a lot of windex. So instead of getting me ynow a bandaid or some ice they immediately told us how much the door is and expected us to replace it for them. \n\nMy mom responded with “sure *host name* but could we get *my name* inside first he has a huge gash on his forehead” and they freaked out saying I was fine and that the door was the bigger issue here.\n\nWell we went home after about 10 minutes of me standing there at the party in awkward silence cause I clearly had glass in my forehead and we decided to just leave unannounced so we could ynow make sure I wasn’t seriously injured, and once we got home, took the shards of glass out, and made sure I was okay, we got an angry phone call from the host. I don’t remember the exact words but I remember the gist \n\n“BLAH BLAH BLAH *insert privileged white person problem* YOU BROKE OUR DOOR AND RUINED OUR PARTY BLAH BLAH BLAH THE PARTY HAD TO BE CANCELED BECAUSE OF YOU *insert standard 58 year old white person overdramatification* YOUR SON IS NO LONGER ALLOWED AT OUR HOUSE BLAH BLAH BOOK CLUB IS CANCELED”\n\nSo now not just these people but my parents also hate me cause they think I did it deliberately to get the party cut short since I didn’t want to go. Despite how many times I’ve told them it was an accident they’re super mad at me, didn’t invite me out to dinner with them, and are acting like I’m a huge asshole. Am I? I thought it was just an accident but everyone else is convinced otherwise. What do I do?",

Kinda long but i feel some of the context is important.\n\nI have been casually dating this girl for a few weeks now (its exclusive but complicated.. ill dive in to that later down) and its been amazing. We've known each other for a few months but had a connection from the start but only started really getting more serious a few weeks ago when we got really close after a particular event that happened. We talked non stop 24/7 for these past weeks been on dates got physical, the usual dating stuff.\n\nThe complicated part comes in because she was talking to someone else up until and before the event that brought us closer together. She asked me for my patience and discretion while she handled that situation to make everything work out, it was a coworker of hers so she didn't want that affecting her job. I agreed to stay patient and let her sort it out in a timely fashion.\n\nFast forward to the other day and we along with a few friends are drinking and hanging out and i start doing some couple things like putting my hand on her butt and arm around her/rubbing her back etc. She seems to enjoy it and reciprocates for awhile but does tell me to stop and not in front of them. I did for a little while but due to being somewhat intoxicated i went back to doing the stuff again. \nThe real issue is some of the people we were with are friends with the guy she was talking to and since she hadn't fully sorted it out she feels i disrespected her by exposing us before she could handle everything. \n\nEverything seemed fine on the drive home we were holding hands touching each other having a good time until her phone starts dinging with messages as soon as we get home with her friends that were with us questioning what was going on, she didn't elaborate with what they were saying just that they were blowing up her phone about me and us now. \nThis is when she and i had a talk where she said she felt i disrespected her and went against my word per our conversation about being discreet she then asked me to leave because she was upset.\n I see her point of view about it but i also feel like its only a issue because her friends were making it a issue after the fact. In my opinion we were having a great night and the drive home was a lot of fun and we were laughing, singing along, smiling back and forth, holding hands and caressing each other her mood instantly changed when her phone started going off when we got home.\n\nTLDR- Girl I've been seeing wanted to be discreet for the time being i exposed us to some of her friends and she is mad at me\n\nAm i the asshole? \n",

He was from a town 3hrs away and so we didn't see each other through the week, only on weekends when he came to stay with me (I was a lowly student, he had a job and could afford the weekly train fare). We talked non-stop, texts, photos and video chats. So it was heartbreaking for me when he suddenly stopped responding for 5 days. He wasn't on fb/insta but I remembered him mentioning twitter competitions. Queue super sleuth mode.  \nMy super desperate self trawled through every account under his name until I found him...he was alive and tweeting since he went AWOL. Trawled through his tweets and I found one mentioning 'his gf' with another user @'d... she had her insta linked to her twitter and so I fell face first into this strangers wonderful shiny documented 3yr relationship with my bf. It was absolutely horrifying, I cried for days.   \n\n\nMy friends talked me out of contacting this girl, I sent him one last, long, explosive message and 'moved on'. It's coming up to 3yrs now and I have the most wonderful loving partner, I am genuinely happy with my life. But I still get this sick feeling when ex's come up in conversation, that I never tried to warn this poor girl.

I just need to know if I'm doing the right thing by leaving it when my heart sometimes says I'm not.  The level of sneakiness on his part always made me feel like I was not the first.

They broke up 2x while she was abroad. He tells me all his relationship problems. When they first broke up in the summer, he called me. He was very distressed and upset. I did my best to comfort him telling him that their dynamic wasn't the best and that they fought constantly and that it was no big deal. Sometimes it just doesn't work out. He ended up getting back with her less than 2 weeks later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis girlfriend is shy so she has trouble making friends. She was lonely when she was studying abroad. My roommate tried to fill the void but it wasn't enough for her. On many occasions, she has said hurtful things to him on why they should break up. Things like \"Give me reasons why we should stay together\" or \"You may think we have good conversations but i don't\". Everytime she comes over to see him, she ends up just watching youtube videos or they end up spooning for 2 hours. Ive heard their conversations and there are many awkward silences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has dumped him 8 times. Every time it is because something upset her and he did not respond appropriately. She then dumps him and blocks him on FB. A week or two goes by and then she realizes that shes lonely and misses him. He always welcomes her back with open arms. Its gotten so bad that I can predict correctly within 3 days the next time they break up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey share the same major but next year, she will be working across the country. His field of study is not very diverse so a part of me believes that he thinks once hes in the work force, he won't find anyone else. I always ask him what he likes about her and all he can say is shes a nice person and he thinks they have good conversations. He is so desperate to stay with his girlfriend that hes whipped. Most of our mutual friends also believe that his relationship is not healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my girlfriend and she said that its his life and who am i to tell him anything about his relationship. I asked him what he is going to change so that it will work. He tells me that every time they get mad at each other, instead of breaking up, they're just going to wait a couple days and then get back together. After pushing him for more, he gets mad at me. I also got mad and told him that from now on I won't ever talk with him about his relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that its quite literally none of my business but I tried my best to look out for him. I tried convincing him to see my and all our friends point of view by saying harsh things about his relationship. Is what I did wrong?

Even I was convinced that I was, in fact, The Asshole at first, but as the night went on I began to have my doubts.  So here's what happened.\n\nLast week a big group went out for a coworker's birthday.  We have a pretty tightknit crew at my job, and there's a big group of us that goes out almost every Friday rain or shine.  The birthday boy is a regular part of that crew.  The person who planned his birthday outing is not, but she works closely with Birthday Boy and wanted to do something nice.  She's old enough to be most of Regular Crew's mom, and is friendly enough, (or so I thought?), though can be a bit sassy.  I've never had an issue before. I like her! I still do, I think, this incident nonwithstanding.  Anyway. She plans an outing into the city to go to dinner.  She asked if I wanted to come a couple weeks before, because she wants to get a number for a reservation.  I say of course, I'll be there with bells on.  Sounds cute.  She does follow up several times, to make sure she has the right number for the reservation.\n\nFast forward to the day of the event. As I'm getting ready to leave work, a couple buddies in Regular Crew ask if I'm going to this party.  I say yeah and ask if they want to ride together.  They do. It's me and three others in my car.  \n\nWhen we arrive, Party Planner gives me side eye so hard I'm afraid they'll get stuck that way.  As the evening goes on, she continues to make a show of acting visibly annoyed.  One of the people I ride with ask me what her name is.  That's when I put two and two together and realize that the three Regular Crew buddies I brought don't know Party Planner.  They were not on her guestlist.  Considering they were already aware of the party, and that they are friends with Birthday Boy, it didn't even occur to me that they wouldn't be part of the official count.  I pull someone closer to Party Planner aside and ask if she's angry with me.  Party Planner's friend says that while she personally thinks \"the more the merrier,\" yes, it's me Party Planner is upset with and maybe I should say something. \n\nI should mention that there are probably about thirty of us here, and while we do have a private room, it's very cramped.  The waitstaff doesn't bat an eye and whips out a couple more chairs, and we all scoot in and get cozy.  But at my first opportunity, as people shuffle around and a chair opens up next to Party Planner, I sit next to her and say, \"Hey, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to throw off your plan or anything,\" and without looking up at me, all she says is, \"I'm annoyed.\"  Yes, I'm thinking, you've made that very clear. I'm kind of at a loss for words that she wouldn't just brush it off and say \"no big deal,\" and I awkwardly retreat back to my friends.  She continues acting bothered down at her end of the table, and apparently not being shy about rude she thinks I am to her friends at that end.  \n\nThe night goes on and people are starting to get rowdy.  I'm not one of the people on a mission to get absolutely twisted, but I have had a few.  I see Party Planner not talking to anyone, and I ask if she's having a good time.  She responds \"Not as good as I could have.\"  Reddit, I am shook at this point! I thought a few drinks in and it would all just be smooth sailing. Everyone seems to be having a good time but her, and do feel bad about that, since she planned this and was really excited to hang out with everyone.  But again, I don't know what to say to her response.  I'm regretting going out of my way to talk to her again, feeling like maybe I rubbed salt in a wound. I confide in Birthday Boy that I am feeling like The Asshole, and he says don't be ridiculous, he's glad the people I brought are there, and that there are a bunch of random coworkers he never even talks to there, and it would be weird if those people were invited but the Regular Crew homies that just happen to not know Party Planner weren't.  \n\nAfter a few hours, Party Planner and the other older coworkers start filtering out, I suppose because they have lives and kids and stuff.  The rest of us young jawns go to a bar down the street that has a lot more standing room, and enjoy each other's company well into the night.  I do hear from someone at some point that Party Planner left in tears.  The person who informed me of this was of the perspective that Party Planner felt neglected and unappreciated when she left.  But at this point I'm kind of over it, and think that if you're going to go out of your way to act miserable, you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to sit next to you at a party.  \n\nSo thanks for reading my long-winded ass story, y'all.

Sometimes she likes to invite us out to eat and always says “if you’re invited, you’re not paying.” My family doesn’t really go out, except maybe ordering pizzas once a week. So eating out isn’t really in our budget. Other things, like special crafts or classes that my mom wants to do, she will pay for. My husband and I combined have a decent income; enough to keep ahead of the bills, but we have no savings, student loan debt, and well, kids. My mom struggled financially when she was a young mom and has told me and my husband that as we were in the same place for the first few years of parenthood.\nSo this is why Im asking...

She insists on saying aloud every tome we all get together that my mom shouldn’t be paying for anything. They will grab the ticket from the table and pay their meals. This puts us in an awkward position. Sometimes it’s literally the question of: do we look like an asshole and be the only offspring to not pay our meal, do we charge it to the credit card, or do we overdraft our banking account?\nor like just today, my mom texted us asking if we wanted to do some candy making craft. I would never go make candy on any occasion except that it’s my moms birthday and she wants us to al be together and make candy. But this sister already texted and said she will only go if my mom agrees to not pay for anyone else.\nAITA for not freaking out about reimbursing my mom for special things she does for me that she has expressed she does not expect payment for? Until just recently my husband and I were over drafting every month just to keep our kids fed and bills paid. We sold our first house and have created a bit of a buffer for the first time in ten years.

I had messaged him earlier this year saying that he could visit me the week of the the 24th , but it seems like he came to Nyc early . This is my finals week and my job has lots of intense days so I’ve been putting in lots of work both inside and outside of the classroom. When I got his text I responded that we could meet up for a few hours as I have work to do. He agreed and met me at my apt at 7:30pm.\n\nThe context was clear : we both were interested in having sex with each other . It had been 4+ years since we’ve seen each other but we’ve been in contact every now and then we would be in contact hence why I told him he could visit me the week of the 24th.\n\nSo we hang out a bit , have sex and cuddle for a little. I start putting my clothes on so that I could get some work done . I ask him what his next move was and he told me he was just going to stay with me. I was shocked because I had not planned for him to stay over and very much wanted my space to study in peace for my finals and just be in my own space alone. The Sex was great but I love alone time and I was very much craving that after he fucked the shit out of me. I expressed this to him and he responded, “I won’t get in your way, I’m just going to be chillin here “\nMe: “no, but that is in my way. I wasn’t expecting you to sleep over because you didn’t tell me you were”\n\nHim : “well, I don’t have anywhere else to go”\n\nMe: “I thought your frat brothers were in the city ? If you needed to sleep over why didn’t you tell me in advance ? I would have arranged for us to meet at another time when I didn’t have so much work to do. I was about to cook for myself , take a shower, study and do my own thing”\n\nHim: “I didn’t expect to be here this late , and now that I am , I was just going to stay here. I won’t be in your way “\n\nMe: “yes, but I was not expecting you to stay here ...I’m waking up early and am working late ...”\n  \nHim: “I can also wake up early , have no where else to go”\n\nSo I let him stay over but I was very annoyed . I stayed up extra late and left all the lights on in my room in hopes that he would eventually figure it out and leave. I listened to class recordings and tried so hard to be a nuance because I very much wanted to be alone. I cooked for myself and did not offer him any food , as I had not gone shopping because, again, I was not expecting him . It’s bad enough that I have roommates that I feel crowd my space , but now this guy was literally all up in my space . \n\nI was finally ready to go to bed. He’s 6’2” ex football player so he’s taking up most of my full size bed . When I get in, he tries to cuddle with me but I actually don’t like cuddling . I had my alarm go off at 5am to get him out early so I could at least enjoy some sleep alone in my bed . When the alarm went off I told him it was time for him to go. He responded , “I’ll leave when you leave “  but that’s not what I wanted ! I wanted him out of my bed . I tell him I have yoga at 6 and want to get ready. He says ok , gets ready and head out.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to be by myself after coitus? For trying to put him out even when he expressed he had no where else to go?

But then it started to get out-of-hand from there, he won't let me talk to other people and feel real sad when I left him.

            "input": "So me and my BF started dated around the same time as my sister and her BF fast forward a year and a half, and my sister gets engaged. I think 1.5 years is too soon to get married, but her BF is military and my sister hangs out with a more church-y crowd, so that's normal, I guess. \n\nMy sister's entire life seems to have evolved around her wedding. Since we were kids she's been picking out colors, venues, themes, watching God knows how many episodes of Say Yes to the Dress and Four Weddings etc.. It's a super big deal for her. She wants to have the Pinterest Perfect wedding of her dreams. Not my cup of tea, but I can see how it would be important for other people.\n\nWhile I've always had fun with the idea of a wedding, in the end I'm very anti-social, I'd rather use the money for an awesome honeymoon or a down payment, and I don't think it's worth the hassle. Since my sister's engagement my mom has teasingly asked me about a wedding in my future. I expressed to her that I didn't expect it in the near future, and that me and BF have agreed that eloping is probably the way to go, as the money, for us, is better spent elsewhere.\n\nA few days later my sister excitedly texts me to tell me the amount my parents had pledged toward the wedding. She was excited because in person they told her it would only be a few thousand, but that day sat down with her and gave her a new number... twice the amount they initially told her. \n\nI was suspicious so I asked my mom about it to which she merely shrugged her shoulders and made some grunting noises. Obviously this left me somewhat upset. Throughout my childhood my parents have implied that they had money set aside for weddings for both of us. And I don't want to imply that I need or deserve that money, but it's only fair that my sister and I get a fair amount. \n\nJust because my sister wants a blow-out wedding and I don't doesn't mean that all their resources should now go towards her. In a way, I guess this is an extension of feeling neglected as a child because my sister would always demand attention and gifts from my parents while I was content to be left alone most of the time. I didn't need or want attention, but that they never thought to give it upset me.\n\nNow, to clarify - and this might muddy the waters a bit - my BF and his family are what you'd politely call 'VERY comfortable' in terms of financial situation. My BF has a substantial trust fund, but I myself make a very modest income (as in, if I wasn't living rent-free with my BF I would probably be on the streets). But that shouldn't matter because who knows? What if I don't end up marrying him? Would I still have no wedding fund because they assumed I would be set for life financially?\n\nMy sister meanwhile, is pushing six figures of income (and we don't live in a high COL area) and her fiance's income isn't anything to sneeze at either considering the military pays for most of his expenses. They both spend pretty frivolously (like 1k a month on beauty kind of frivolous and multiple international trips a year), but with some belt tightening they could easily save up enough for a great wedding. My sister alone currently makes more than my parents ever made combined, which is a point of frustration they have both expressed in having to fund this wedding. But weddings are a pretty big deal in my mom's culture, and really it will serve as a family reunion/way to show off for her as many of our relatives from out of the country will be flying in for it. So I can see why in her mind it made sense to 'redirect' the funds set aside for me.\n\nStill, AITA for thinking I deserve 'my cut' of wedding money even if I don't plan to have a 'wedding' per se?",

Another person chimed in and said that I was sexists and that this line of thinking was a lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I initially wrote off the other person as being overly sensitive, but I later realized that I could've been mistaken because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this field.

It got better and I genuinely thought that I would be feeling great again tomorrow. That's why I didn't go to the doctor yet. This evening, I start to feel worse again, my throat hurts really bad and I'm coughing nonstop. I tried to go to bed early, but couldn't fall asleep because I've been waking myself up with coughing. He was out with friends and when he returned at about 1.30am I was pretty miserable, because I just wanted to sleep but couldn't. He seems to be understanding and said good night. Now, remember the coughing? It just didn't stop, resulting in none of us sleeping and me being in pain. It goes on for about one hour, with him getting more and more annoyed. He then gets some earplugs. Unfortunately the coughing still won't stop and I start to get kind of desperate. Half-crying I turn to him, hoping he could do something or at least just be there for me. Instead he raises his voice saying \"please stop, I just want to sleep.\" \"what can I even do\" and \"I have an important day tomorrow.\" (studying for an exam) and in the end \"just go to a doctor if it doesn't get better\". This makes me cry because now I feel it's my fault and then I walked out and go to the living room. Now I'm feeling even worse, still awake as ever, kind of cold because I only have a thin blanket now.\nAfter calming myself down I took some painkillers and now feel a little bit better. \n\nNow, am I right to think it's really selfish to react like this? I mean I get the frustration when you can't sleep (duh, because I'm having the same struggle) but is it too much to think he could act a little bit more empathetic? I have to say, his personality is rather selfish in situations when he doesn't feel well and I have thought similar thoughts in other situations.\nReddit, AITA when I'll tell him tomorrow that his behavior really hurt me? I feel he would find some kind of excuse to not validate my feelings and that's why I want to make sure you would act the same way. Thanks! ",

Here the long story when I was pregnant my ex was happy about it when we were together but times went on about 2 months his demeanor/attitude change he started being more rude about things. Didn't want go to the doctor appointment he only went maybe 3times. I was okay with that. Then he started make comments how I'm not the same anymore to how immature I Have Become ect. He try to feel the bady move but said he thought it was weird. He started called the baby a fetus. As time when on we to find if we have boy or girl he just look at the screen with my parents. We found out it was a boy and my dad was so excited but when he ask my ex how he feels it all he said im happy and that was it. When I was 7 months things turn for the wrost he broke up with me and told me I could stay but made it sound like I was unwelcome and started hang with anther girl. So I couldn't handle it so I moved back with my parents and he was okay with it. We made agree in talking that we keep how my son name would be after him to he how to make effort no matter what to be in my son his life like call to visit ect. Well after I move out he change again and start not doing what he said he would do. Call maybe ever now then ask about how my son is. There times I had to beg him. Then he got into relationship with that girl after 2 weeks with this girl was my friend too and I warn her about him. Same thing kept happen and he told me that when he see my son every other weekend when he born. Well that didn't sit right with me but at the same time didn't register (note this whole time I was depressed and upset about the whole thing) but I went with it. I still have beg him to ask how the baby is. He would tell me he love the baby and be the there for him but his actions was telling me different.  He told me to call or text when the baby with going to come. Well my dad told me if he not going to full effort now then he won't when my son is born that he shouldn't have right to baby at all. As my son about came  he was there band the girl was too which I told him I didn't want to her because I felt she betrayed me as her friend tell me she got my back so on. The tell I was have contractions more more he told me that why i call him even though the baby wasn't here yet. He brother was there all excited about it. him on the other hand act all emotionless. Few hours past I had my son. He held him smile my mom ask you thinking. His exact response i feel like im staring at myself. That was it. Minutes past and he told me I have to accept his girlfriend into my son's life even if I don't like it. I just look at him didn't say words my heart broke even more (note I was tired and exhausted after give birth) then he went back home for work. Later texting my mom that he will take care of the maternity test so he can be on the birth certificate( note he wasn't there when I did all the paperwork for the birth certificate) when my son was a week old hey I've been text me saying I want to see my son but he's bringing his girl I told him no I feel uncomfortable about her comeing but he can come see him. He said no I want her to be there so I just take him to the Park. I said no it to cold outside. He still insisted take him to the park so his girlfriend could see him. I was upset I thought I deal with it because my hormones were going all wacky. So my mom told him to stop act like she his mom that this shouldn't be about her but my son. He said okay then I didn't hear very much from him ever now and how the baby. Then he text mom mom that he got the maternity test ready and me and my mom should go there now. My mom got a little bit aggravated and told him we're not going to always jump every time you say jump. ( note I kind of stopped talking to him because he kept guilt-tripping me and making me sound like I was a horrible person the only time I talk him if it's about my son) He didn't respond the day then saying he comeing over I said okay I waited 6 hour he didn't show then text to me saying something came up. This happen 3 more time less he ask how my son was he kept making up excuses I begged him over and over to come see his son. Nothing work it was always a excuse. I finally got tired of it and getting more more depressed so blocked him on Facebook been changed my number he send my mom ask why i block him when he should have already knew. Now it's been almost 2 years and he still has not made any effort. I Heard it Through the Grapevine he doesn't even talk about me or my son anymore. Him and the girl broke up he move back with his parents that what I heard and now he talk about my son again even though he hasn't made any effort to come see him after he has a girlfriend again. Did I make the right choice? I was trying save son from heart brake because I seen so my many of my friends go through the same situation with their parents and I didn't want that for him I wanted him to have a father to come see him all the time and be there for him not just wait when ever his father feels like it. I begged him to come see his son in past I did everything but it felt like it was never enough for him. It felt like was always bad person to him it seemed. ",

We're lesbians. I asked her to marry me six months ago and our wedding will be held in a year and a half. We're extremely excited, planning on having kids after the wedding and so on. She's everything I've ever dreamed of and knew from the first time I saw her that I'd make her my wife someday. She knew that as well. There is just one thing bothering me in our relationship. \n\nMy fiancée has a male friend, let's call him Hank. Hank is tall, his clothing and hair style is \"psychobilly\" and he lost his virginity at 26 by having sex with the 17-year-old daughter of his best friend. After that, he started a false rumour that the girl gave him chlamydia and he hasn't had sex since. He has also been unemployed for a long time, because according to him, he doesn't know how to make a CV. Y'know, the kind of a person I wouldn't want to hang around with. Hank is now 27 as well and was a co-worker of my fiancée about six years back, when we hadn't met yet. They became friends and have hung out ever since. However, another co-worker of theirs at that workplace at the time jokingly said to Hank that my fiancée had a crush on him, which is impossible since she's a lesbian. Hank, for some incomprehensible reason, believed it to be true. \n\nEver since then Hank has harassed my fiancée by saying stuff like \"I'd be the man of your dreams\", \"You just haven't tried my dick\", \"I love you and would make you happy\" etc... He insists that my fiancée should sleep with him in order to find out how amazing of a person he is and it doesn't matter that my fiancée is not interested, because according to him, starting a relationship with him would change how my fiancée sees him. He also demands she sees him at LEAST three times a week, and plays martyr (\"you're a bad friend, I'm so lonely, nobody wants to spend time with me\") when she doesn't. She feels horrible whenever Hank does this and doesn't understand why he can't just shut up about it. She's told him multiple, even hundreds of times that she is not interested and will never be. He doesn't accept that. This has gone on for about five years. \n\nNow, he isn't this bad all the time. The reason my fiancée hangs out with him still, is that he can be nice and not speak about that nasty stuff for a while and they share the same passion: cars. They can have a really nice time together and he might go for about a month without harassing her, but then start the bullshit again. \n\nHowever, I feel extremely annoyed and even hurt that my fiancée still hangs out with him. In the past she has cut all contact with him but when that happened, he started visiting her parents all the time, begging for them to reach out to her and ask her to \"be his friend again\". My fiancée says that she never wants that to happen again, as she doesn't want her parents involved. She has blocked him everywhere except instagram, through which they can plan to meet whenever he's being nice again. I have suggested that she could get a restraining order against him, but she says she doesn't want to hurt him and he's the only person she can talk about cars with. \n\nI told her this feels like she'd rather keep hurting me than hurt him. She said that she feels bad and if it comes to that, she will cut all contact with him. Just now she texted him and told him that if he ever talks about his feelings again, she will cut off all contact with him. \n\nAITA for wanting my fiancée to stop being his friend? If not, any advice? \nI feel extremely disrespected but also guilty when my fiancée tells me he's the only person with whom she can talk about cars. \n\nShe read this text before I sent it to you guys so we're very open about the situation. \n\nTL;DR: We're lesbians, getting married in 2020. Fiancée has a male friend Hank, who won't stop sexually harassing her and insisting that she should sleep with him. Fiancée doesn't want to cut all contact with him, because he can be nice at times and he's the only friend she shares her car passion with. I feel disrespected. AITA for wanting her to still cut all contact with him? \n\n",

            "input": "A little background: My girlfriend and I have known each other for two years, we use to work together. We were together for two months before our jobs had her relocate to a foreign country, then we talked and video chatted daily for a month leading up to my visit. I love her so much, we click really well, and we had been talking about engagement leading up to the trip.\n\nAlso, go easy on me, I'm not a great writer.\n\nWell, I got my trip situated to put in for leave for the entire duration of the trip (14 days total) with two days travel time on the front end and three days on the backend. I had all my flights booked, made it there after some pretty long flights, no problems in our relationship at all before getting there. We were so excited to be seeing each other for the first time in months, and it had been about a year since our last romantic encounter. We broke up for about a year after a two-month fling that got a little ugly because she was going through a bad divorce. We talked about it a lot after-words and we ended it because she started to love me, and she wasn't ready for that so soon after her divorce.\n\nWell, I show up and everything is great, better than great actually. The sex is fantastic, we are laughing, eating, having fun. Just a really awesome time only problem at this time is her internet went off because she forgot to pay the bill for a few months. Well we get to the third day of the trip she has an appointment she has to go to and I ask if she wants me to give her some space since we had spent so much time together. I thought it might be healthy to take a breather. Well, she didn't like that too much and she told me \"I'm not wasting my breath asking if you want to come, you can come if you want to but I'm not making you do anything.\" in sort of a negative tone. So I wait a little bit, still not sure if I should go after the aggression but decide to start getting ready. Usually, she takes a bit longer to get ready so I was a little slow on the ball and she leaves after telling me I was too slow and should have gotten ready earlier, fair, but keep in mind it was still about 45 minutes to the appointment, which was right down the road. So I wait until she gets back and I ask if she wants to talk about it, she tells me not really. So I apologize and tell her my point of view on the interaction. She gets very upset at me and tells me to stop starting shit. I was a little taken aback by that and remained quiet and let her get it out of her system, she took this as me pouting. I help her with the bill which is well over $400 at this point, but I know she will pay me back. We spend the rest of the day watching TV, unable to talk because I couldn't start a conversation without it veering south, and not physical affection from her at all.\n\nDay four is like this as well, we had times in the past where sometimes she just needs a little time, so I give it to her and lay on the opposite side of the bed, she did not want to be touched. We laid in bed the whole day, then went out to dinner with some of her friends.\n\nDay five starts off the same, no cuddling or anything in bed which is different because in the past we had always cuddled to sleep, but she said it was too hot so I didn't argue. When we are waking up she grabs my hand and kisses it, honestly at this point I'm just internally begging for any kind of affection so it was very heartwarming. She had to go get a birth control implant that day, and those things hurt for days. We went on a trip to a lake with one of her friends this day, started off the same after she was fully awake as the previous two days, mostly ignored again or a negative attitude. The drive to the lake is about an hour and 45 minutes, she didn't address me once the entire drive and only talked to her friend. Her friend, however, was very nice and talked with me about some mutual interests. We get to the lake and she is actively trying to avoid talking to me still, went to some shops near it and she wouldn't talk to me, or respond to any of my comments about some trinkets. We start the drive back and we make a snack stop because he friend had to take a number two, I say I'm going in and ask if she wants anything. She turns to her friend in the back seat and asks him to get her a drink. After her friend leaves, I ask her what's going on and why thing have been weird\" the past few days. Her reply is nothing was wrong and that she wants space, then she tells me I'm the one whos starting \"shit out of nothing\" because she \"asked her friend instead of me to get her a drink\". I quickly drop the subject hoping that it really was like that. We get back to her place that night and things actually seem a bit better, we end of having sex that night not great because of her arm but I'm just glad we are back to being affectionate.\n\nDay six I wake up feeling pretty good, although we couldn't cuddle or anything during the night because I didn't want to risk her arm being hurt. She has a quick appointment to take a short class, then she is back. She kissed me when she got back. after that, it seemed like the previous night didn't change anything and we are back to how it was before distance and negativity. We spend the rest of the day inside watching TV, eat Popeyes for dinner. Silence for nearly the entire day between negative comments anytime I try to start a conversation. Day seven Then it was back to more of the same, we go out to eat at a KBBQ style place and its dead silence nearly the entire time, aside from passing food back and forth and making sure each other have enough to eat. I try to ask why things are so weird between us again and I get shut down instantly, again. Apparently its fine and she just doesn't feel like talking. No affection at all this day.\n\nDay eight at this point I'm really at my wit's end, I can't deal with this silence much longer and I'm just counting down the clock to leave the next morning. We eat Popeyes for dinner and stay inside all day again, going to the superstore to pick up some necessities for a little bit, but it's obvious she didn't want my presence. I didn't bother to bring up the subject and I was just looking to get on my flight the next day. Day nine My flight got delayed a day. We went back to her place for two hours and got in an argument because I made a joke about something we were watching. After that, I went and got a hotel room. Day ten I boarded my flight, we didn't talk at all this day aside from organizing her to get me to the airport, maybe 10-minute drive for her in total. I said my goodbyes and she was silent. Later on, she texts me telling her when I land at each stop and acting as if she cared. It felt nice.\n\nDay eleven I'm at a layover at my next stop, total time is about a day. I have a lot of time to think so I confront her about how the trip was for me and my point of view on the whole thing. She was very quick to make excuses to a comment I made about how I felt like I \"wasn't able to talk and I was more or less silenced\" telling me that \"just because things didn't go the way YOU expected does not mean YOU know exactly how I feel\", telling me that I \"wasn't being ignored\" and that I was making her a \"villain\". She told me that I \"kept pushing her\" to talk about what was wrong, and that's why she was refusing to say what was bothering her. After that, I kind of just told her that I was done pursuing the relationship, explained why the trip was very hurtful to me and try to explain it to the best of my ability from my point of view. Which is basically that I have no idea aside from that first argument why everything went so downhill so fast, and that I felt like the distance between us was greater when I was there than when I wasn't. Basically just pouring my heart out about how I wanted a little more attention. Well, she tells me that \"just because things didn't go your way, you're making me the villain.\" and that she's upset that I pushed her way too much to talk while I was there.\n\nThis is already really long, I wish I could show all of you what happened more accurately. \n\nTLDR: Visited girlfriend 7000 miles away, got in a small argument after being there for three days. Isolated and ignored for the most part for the rest of trip afterward, told I'm the one making the problem.\n\nI'm at a loss Reddit, Am I The Asshole for wanting a little more attention and verbal/physical affirmation in our relationship after traveling all that way?",

Recently (within the past year) I have been joining their group on social outings, birthday dinners, drinks, get togethers with the kids, etc.  At the beginning of November we all did a 5k together and went out to dinner that night.  Since then, I have been invited to ONE gathering, which included all the children and involved bringing food and gifts.  The rest of the ladies have gotten together at least six other times, including a New Year's gathering.  I have not been invited, and have seen multiple posts on fb about all the fun.  \n\nRecently one of the ladies posted about planning a trip and asking for recommendations.  I asked about the trip and she said I was welcome to come, giving me dates, hotels where they have reservations, etc.  I replied that I didn't know they were that far into the planning process and didn't want to intrude.  One of the ladies I am quite close to (exercising with her four days a week) and I told her I felt excluded.  She said they had planned the trip as a celebration of her upcoming divorce finalization (which she and I have discussed at length) and I SHOULD come and I shouldn't feel excluded.

I told her I understood, and I didn't think she was doing anything wrong, I'm just protecting my feelings.

I've had to become complacent because every time I explain to her nicely that I pay the rent just like her and would appreciate if she cleaned it every 1-2 days instead, especially since he's a big cat and lays huge turds.

Family is extremely important to my side of the family, so this is a huge problem for me when I don't get time with them. We live close to her family, and it uses half of my vacation allocation yearly which severely limits the time I get to see my own family.

It didn't work, because thankfully they were all reasonable and told her what she was doing was wrong, but it was a HUGE embarrassment to me. She apologized profusely but this is a reoccurring issue with her that she knows I get sick missing my family, she knows how I feel isolated, and then she tries to involve them and have them gang up on me.

Her parents live out of state, and when they've visited in the past, she's let them stay at her place to be closer, and to save money.

It sounds like a respect thing for her, and how she was raised.\n\nMy point of view is that while I'm very supportive of her parents visiting and want them to come, and want to host them in our home and make arrangements for their comfort, I'm just not comfortable giving up my bed to them. To me my bed is a very private and personal place for only me and my GF.

BF and i were wanting to on a trip alone just the two of us this year, and after a day of searching fun things to do on a weekend trip, i just asked if we can go to the beach for a couple days for a long weekend, just to relax together. He mentioned bringing FR to the beach since he works long hours and deserves a break, this way it would be cheaper and we can go the whole week to the beach instead of three nights. I agreed, under the circumstance that we get a hotel room with two seperate bedrooms. We found a decently priced condo on the beach, two levels. One bedroom had two queen beds and the other had one kind bed. Because we are dating and FR doesnt date anyone, naturally we took the king bedroom (also its the master bedroom and has beach views and its on the second level loft of the condo and I'M SO EXCITED, as a side note).\n\nI told FR we found a condo, he'd have his own balconly overlooking the bay, his own bathroom and his own bedroom. He seemed annoyed that there were two beds.I should also mention that whenever we DO share a condo room with FR, he snores. Not little snores, but its extremely loud to the point where BF and i cant get sleep.\n\nOur two friends are also getting married in august. BF, FR, and i were invited...wedding is five hours away on a saturday, so I figured we can drive down together on friday and leave on sunday so we dont have to worry about rushing the day of\n\nI mentioned to BF that the hotel that is blocked off has cheaper rates, so we can get our own room so FR has his own.

Now, I'm not super confrontational, but I was upset so I called A to talk to her about what B told me and immediately denied it, saying she would never hurt me or betray my trust like that, then she states he must have figured it out himself because I don't look very straight. She was adamant that B was lying, but when I pointed out B didn't have any reason to lie and she started crying, \"how can you not believe me?\" I got really uncomfortable so I offered to talk to her about this a different time when she'd calmed down but she seemed even more offended by this saying she didn't need me to coddle her feelings. Okay, that's fine, but as the conversation progressed she got so emotional I ended up hanging up. I called her the day after to talk about it, and she was determined that B had lied, and that she was upset that I didn't believe her. She said it so forcefully I started to believe her but after pondering it for a bit I decided I wasn't entirely sure if I did believe her and that's where the tables turned. She started screaming about how we were \"basically best friends\" and \"how can you believe him over me?\" In the end I backed down and said I believed her even though I didn't. Flash forward a couple months and a classmate of mine tells me that A had outed me to them about a week after A outed me to B. At this point I'm flabbergasted, A wasn't even friends with this person, I barely knew this person, why the fuck did they know that I was gay before I was even out? That's when I decided to cut A out of my life. There were other really shitty things she'd done to me but that was my breaking point. I told her I had no interest in being friends anymore, this did not end well and she basically told me to fuck off.

A on the other hand, make a big scene when talking to my friends, hoping to catch me at some point.

She texts back “what?” and we tell her we don’t appreciate repeatedly being lied to, and that we aren’t trying to parent her but that the one rule was that we weren’t going to let her live with us rent-free to get away from her boyfriend if they were STILL DATING.\n\nMy question is, are we the assholes for giving her that one guideline to live with us? It was completely rent free and we never asked her to clean or help with anything, just that she not get back with her boyfriend that had kicked her out twice.

She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn’t that big of a deal because it’s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there’s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory’s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn’t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn’t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn’t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there’s no one else she’s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn’t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn’t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn’t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere’s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy’s brand of “firey” is a Much better match to Gregory’s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it’s those two. I just can’t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?",

I've been now on maternity leave for more than six months (which is standard in my country) and I work 10 hours/week from home, my husband works full-time.\n\nOur baby is not sleeping through the night yet - he is waking up every 60-90 minutes for feeding. We are bottle-feeding him.\n\nI am quite frustrated by the fact that it's always me bottle-feeding him at night &amp; I'm always the one who gets up with him in the morning. \n\nI understand that I'm the one getting less sleep when my husband goes to work. We have a guest room and my husband occasionally sleeps there to get enough sleep. We both work in IT and he has always needed more sleep to be able to work than I did.  But it's the same during the weekends and it was the same even when we went for 2-week holidays - my husband refused to feed our baby at night at all &amp; he only got up with him once and bragged the whole day about how tired he is.\n\nI'm also a bit frustrated by the fact that during the weekends or evening when we are both at home, I'm still the one who is doing most work with the baby and around the house - it seems to me that it never happens that I relax, while my husband is taking care of the house or of the baby. The opposite (I'm doing stuff and he is relaxing) is happening all the time. \n\nWe talked about that I feel he is not thanking me enough for being sleep-deprived and letting him relax. E.g. he almost never thanks me in the morning when he sleeps in the guest room. We also talked about the fact that he feels I'm not appreciating him enough for working full-time and providing for the family &amp; I don't thank him enough when he helps me with the kid. He complained that I often say that his help is not much compared with what I'm doing. I must say that he has a point in this, but it comes from my frustrations described above.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I was sick and had a bad cough. Everytime I coughed, our baby woke up and started to cry. My husband agreed that I can sleep in the guest room. First time since our baby was at home, I slept for 9 hours straight.\n\nI thanked my husband in the morning. He told me it was very difficult for him. In the evening I approached and I told him \"Thank you so much for taking care of our boy during the night.\" He seemed very happy that I thanked him. After that I told \"Now you can appreciate more what I do every night\". He looked at me as if I hurt him badly. He told me he though I'm finally thanking him and appreciating him, but I just talked about the fact how good I am.\n\nHe said it will be difficult for him to overcome how I hurt him.\n\n3 weeks later, and yesterday he told me he still can't believe me I'm being honest when I thank him for something, and that what I said 3 weeks ago hurt him very much.\n\nTL;DR: Husband never takes care of the baby during the night or in the morning. When he did for the first time when I was sick, I thanked him and said \"Now you can appreciate more what I do every night\".",

It was not the only time she backstabbed me but this action is the most relevant for the story as it had a large impact on me and my trust issues towards her.\n\nI forgave her.\n\nFast forward to the current point in time and all of a sudden the two of them are really good friends. After months of not talking, the relationship between them has gotten to a point where they are constantly texting each other, talking about everything and spending a hell lot of time with each other. He has even slept over at her place a few times.\n\nNow, I talked to both of them about the situation, telling them that it makes me feel uncomfortable, mainly because of what had happened between them already (I didn't scream or curse at either of them). My boyfriend said he felt sorry and that he would spend a little less time with her (I later told him that I didn't want to impair his social life). My best friend, on the other hand, started crying, claimed that I hurt her feelings and that she was at the brink of ending our friendship because of what I said.\n\nI told her that I was sorry and we continued acting normally again.\n\nA day later, while I'm talking to my boyfriend on discord he tells me about how he's going to sleep over at her place. I texted her, saying that I think it's a bit inconsiderate of her to just disregard everything I just told her the day before. She then got really angry at me and told me to stop forcing my boyfriend to stay away from his friends (which I have never done, not even when it comes to her) and how I'm a complete asshole who just thinks about herself while humiliating her and constantly hurting her feelings. At this point I was pretty mad too and noted that she should stop getting pissed off because I was hurt over a mistake **she** had made. I didn't get a response for a while, because apparently she spent the day with my boyfriend. A few hours later I got a passive-aggressive apology and, once again, we started texting normally afterwards. At this point I was tired of getting into a fight everytime I tried to express my feelings so I just dropped the topic and never brought it up again.\n\nYesterday, I talked about something revolving around the relationship I had with the ex I mentioned above. The story didn't even involve her but she immediately started getting angry again and said something along the lines of: \"I'm just gonna act like you didn't just reproach me for doing something two years ago again.\"\n\nLuckily, it was pretty easy to avoid conflict by just explaining what I meant but what she said in that situation has sticked with me. I just don't know anymore, am I overexaggerating or is she just inconsiderate? Am I the Asshole?",

When growing up I only ever really interacted with a small handful of people, so I'm usually a little lacking on social cues. I've also had an irrational fear that my friends never really cared about me, and just kinda showed they did to be nice or look good or something. I know it's stupid and I know they do actually care, but it's just something my mind likes to tell me every once in a while. It’s usually a problem and I can ignore it. I’ve had the same group of friends for about 8 years, and for the past year and a half we’ve been getting together weekly to play games and hang out. \n\nThis happened in August. One of the guys from the group, I’ll call him John, was telling my fiance about how he thinks I’m a jerk and he’s not close to me or anything, and hasn’t been since we’ve started our weekly hang out. Saying I just make fun of him all the time. TBF we all usually joke with each other a lot, though if someone goes too far we say something. He never once told me I was taking it too far or that he felt disrespected, and I had no idea that he felt that way. He would just act the way he always did around me. We got together as a group to talk about it and when I heard it really hit me hard. Not only that what I thought was just joking between friends was actually hurtful, but also that for over a year he was basically lying to me, pretending like we were still friends. I actually broke down in front of my friends from that. I tried apologizing and saying that I never meant it like that and that I cared for him, but that I felt betrayed as I trusted my friends to be able to talk to me about anything. Like I said, I’ve always had the fear that my friends don’t really care, then boom it kinda happened. He didn’t really accept my apology and didn’t think I deserved one in return, saying that I was completely in the wrong and he did nothing bad. Nothing really got resolved and we just tried to move on from there, but he no longer showed up for game night. \n\nA couple weeks ago another one of my friends started going off in our group chat that I was being a jerk to John and that I was excluding him from everything and basically abusing him and had no room to ask for an apology. I was at work when this was all going on but when I went through it on my break I almost had a panic attack, and brought back those old fears. I have done nothing to exclude John from our group or anything to attack him. It’s been a rough couple weeks since then, and it’s been on my mind the entire time. I’ve already tried to apologize once and it was rejected, plus he doesn’t really care about how I was hurt. AITA for wanting an apology after I was hurt or am I the one who is completely to blame for this?\n\nTL;DR: My friend thinks I’m bullying him and hides it for over a year, then doesn’t feel bad when my feelings are hurt.",

He can't speak, but he was an okay kid until puberty hit him. Now he's gotten more aggressive, yelling and screaming and putting holes in the wall of his bedroom. Therapy and medication isn't helping, and I can't stand the yelling. I tried to be patient with him and ignore him but he pushes me so far that I start screaming back at him. It's gotten so bad that I had to start wearing earplugs whenever I go downstairs, and I spend most of my free time in my room. Sometimes, when my parents aren't home, he targets me specifically for no apparent reason and screams up the staircase to my room until I either lose it and start screaming back or I go to my car and leave. Last time it happened, I just locked myself in the bathroom and cried. Despite my parents being in the same boat and arguably have it worse than me because they're responsible for him, they obviously don't know how to help me as their advice to me either boils down to \"ignore him\" (which never works) or \"calm down\" (which upsets me more). My brother shows no signs of improving and I doubt he'll ever talk at this point. It's gotten to where I can't stand living with him and want to leave home. My mom picked up on this and started crying to me about how she doesn't want me to leave because of my brother and that I would be throwing away the rest of my childhood if I do because then I'll have to step into the adult world.

I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job.

Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared.

I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe’s taken from my account without my okay before. I’ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn’t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying “IT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that.

My parents weren't very supportive of this decision and said that they wouldn't help me financially to move up there. I took it upon myself to work a fast food job to save enough money to move, and I did. I finally moved up, got a job, live in my own apartment (that I pay for), have a girlfriend, financial security, etc. \n\nA few months go by and it's Christmas time, my parents are nice enough to buy me a train ticket to come down and visit for a week. It was a great time, I see my friends, family, and I have an overall fun time altogether. That is until Christmas rolls around. Everybody was getting gifts except me, which didn't really make me sad, it's all about being around family that makes me happy. Finally at the end, I get a gift from my Mom and Step-dad. I was a bit surprised because I wasn't really expecting a gift. I open it and it's a book, titled \"Manual to Manhood.\" Inside there were instructions on everything that makes a man a man. How to change a flat, how to put on deodorant, how to pick up women, etc. Everything was dumbed down into two pages each, and the information in there were things I already knew how to do. I was a bit upset at the gift because I felt like my parents didn't think I was doing a good job or *manly* enough, or knew how to do anything. I didn't get into an angry fit, but they saw that I was visibly upset and thought that it was ungrateful that I didn't like their gift. \n\nEventually once I got back to New York I ended up tossing it because there was really nothing I could do with it. \nWas I just overreacting asshole?",

BF3 is tipsy, ranting, then goes outside. \n\nWe were confused, but let him cool off. \n\nAs part of the quiz, our phones were ‘forfeited’ to one side (if caught on your phone you buy another table a round). \n\nBF3’s phone had work messages, so I go get him. He ignores it, still ranting. I went inside. He soon comes in to sit down- ranting again...\n\nBF3: Ohhh, guess what the next answer is!

BF2 gasped in a ‘Woah, don’t say that shit’ way. BF1 told BF2 to shut up and behave. A while later, I take BF2 home, then drop BF1 and BF3 at their house. As BF3 is climbing out of my car, I get a small wave and a ‘Sorry, Joscelan.’ I kept quiet, and decided to sleep on it and see how I felt the next day. \n\nI still felt like shit, so I text BF3 and tell him I’m hurt, my insecurities about it, how it cut me deeper than he thinks.\nBF3: ‘Like I said, I’m sorry. I’m a drunk idiot. I have a harsh tongue when I’m annoyed. Let’s move on’. \n\nI felt like he wasn’t taking my feelings seriously just brushing me off. \n\nTwo days later, we’re at our monthly PN (poker) with friends. (F4 is the additional character here). \n\nDuring our pizza break, I’d have to climb over the seats in my way, then get the people in those seats to climb out for me to climb back in.

I said a quick sorry getting out of my car or by text isn’t an apology. \n\nConversation ends quite quickly. \n\nThe next day BF1 is off. I took it that he was hungover, had to go to work, and wanted to sleep. I later receive a text calling me a ‘sly c*nt’ for how I was whispering. \nI didn’t see my behaviour that way, so I texted him back to explain it from my POV. We end up dropping it. \n\nNext PN, I tell BF1 I’m still really hurt, and he snaps that I’m a c*nt and to get over it. Then he told me to speak to BF3 because he doesn’t want to be involved- but the reason I was trying to ask how to broach the subject with BF3. \n\nI sent him a long text about my feelings, my POV, how I should’ve said it differently.

He never raised a hand or his voice to me growing up. Very mild tempered. He has held a grudge against me from when I was 11 years old. The day I told him I wanted to live with my grandma because he was depressed and would not give me any attention. Ever since I have heard from him very rarely. His balls are basically in his wife's pocket. Its his third wife and he wont risk losing another one, he does whatever she says. Im a single mom of two kids, 3 and 5. They rarely see him, he doesn't call them. When they used to visit my grandma he would drive by there and see them for 10 minutes. He would act like hes grandpa of the year. He didnt want them at his house...which was fine I knew they were babies and difficult to handle. After years of never asking for a favor, I told him I was invited on an amazing trip and it would be something for me to do on my own, and have a break. I am trying to plan for my kids to be taken care of for 8 days and giving everyone 2 months notice. I live 6 hours from family so I thought everyone would be looking forward to seeing the kids.  I asked my dad if he would like to have them for 2 nights over the weekend. He lives on a farm and I know they would love seeing the animals. He says he has to ask his wife and comes back with \"I want to see them but I cant spend my 2 nights off watching kids. It isn't fair to me or wife. They should be your priority and you cant just leave them for this amount of time. Watching them for a couple hours is one thing but the whole weekend is another. This isn't a break, its extreme\". I never ask him for anything. Its not the trip, I can take or leave the trip, its him making it seem like its such an annoying request. He said that he cant maintain a relationship with them because I live too far away. I said people live a distance from their grand kids all the time and make it a priority to talk to them. I am driving the kids there and picking them up. I ask for childcare maybe twice a year from my mom for 2 nights. AITA for cutting him off for good from our lives? Maybe I am being entitled and dont realize it. I know they are my responsibility and no one elses. I never thought asking for family help would feel so much like begging. You would think they would want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to mention he is holding a mini grudge against me for leaving my husband. I was emotionally and mentally abused and cheated on, but he blames me for tearing apart the kids family.

            "input": "So, some backstory first. This will be long, very long, I apologize. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy dad has always had terrible anxiety that he never bothered to treat for a variety of reasons. He is terrified of public transit, high winds, pit bulls, crowded spaces, so many things, and it's a very legitimate fear to him. Sometimes he seems to know his fears are irrational, but that doesn't stop them. This has shaped my childhood in many ways, for example I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license until I was 20 but also not allowed to ride my bike anywhere farther then a mile away, take the bus, or ride with any but a few friends of mine he trusted. Growing up with these restrictions and fears turned me into a bit of a nervous shut-in. At 22 I started to get very sick, we later found out I have multiple sclerosis. This ramped his anxiety up to a new level and also ensured I would be living at home with him for much longer. During this time my parents took care of everything I needed, even though I could barely move. Medical care cost them more then I can ever pay back and they don't even want me to pay them back. I am very grateful. \n\nMy boyfriend of the time understood I needed extensive care but was also going crazy living at my parents' home, so he invited me to live with him. My dad didn't allow it but I left anyway. After a few months he understood and accepted it. It helps that my then-boyfriend now husband is a wonderful person and my dad loves him.\n\nA few years later he had his first heart attack. This ramped his anxiety up again but also prompted him to finally accept treatment. Sadly, he stuck with the first medication he was given and it only works a little bit and he left his first counseling session in the middle and refuses to return. Still, his anxiety went down for a while and our relationship started to flourish. I even managed to have a few conversations with him about his overzealous restrictions. \n\nWhen I was 29 four major things happened: I got unexpectedly pregnant (surprise! You're not infertile!), something horrible that is a different story left my fiance and I effectively homeless, my dad had a second and much worse heart attack, followed by open heart surgery, and my MS went into remission. All of these things sent my dad's anxiety spiraling out of control. He can't sleep, he has lost way too much weight, he doesn't eat much, and he is well on his way to a third heart attack from anxiety alone! But he will not have the doctor look at his anxiety medication or return to counseling. \n\nMy husband and I frantically searched for a place we could afford to rent that we could move into right now and would allow our pets and actually found the perfect place... directly across the street from my parents' house. It won't be so bad, right? Plus, it's not like we could find another place like that on such short notice. We knew we were wrong when my parents cornered our new landlord and managed to convince him to give them our keys. Naturally, they made copies of every single one. We very excitedly prepared for our baby, and I started moving around and getting out more, realizing how hard life can be when you are unable to get out at all. We learned that I was capable of caring for a child with a few accommodations in our home but still not able to hold a regular job and I became a stay at home mom. It didn't take long before it was glaringly obvious I could not raise a healthy child shut in the house, so I learned how to use public transit. \n\nNow, I am 33 and married with a healthy, very active, and not remotely anxious four year old son and another son due in March. I am mostly blind and my MS has returned, but it's not as bad as it was. I am very familiar with the public transit system in our city, and it's not a bad one. My dad is retired and spends most of his time watching our house from his kitchen window. He calls me to ask where I am going and ask me not to go there every single time he sees me heading anywhere, even the grocery store he wants to come with. Everywhere non-essential he tells me not go. If he had his way, his grandson would never go to the park or public pool. He regularly goes through my mail and even more regularly lets himself in my house, where he proceeds to fiddle with my thermostat and simultaneously lecture me over a mess that usually doesn't even exist and also lecture me for \"pushing myself too far.\" My son thinks his grandfather is the best thing since ice cream and I don't want to separate him but he is starting to avoid some of his favorite activities, such as digging in the dirt, because his grandfather told him it is too dangerous and this is infuriating me and potentially harming my boy. \n\nFor a while I would compromise by staying home about half the time he asked me or asking him to drive us instead if it bothered him, but this only made my dad more upset and he started to do things such as hide my stroller or \"borrow\" my cane to make sure it was very hard for me to get anywhere. Keep in mind that I may now be a grown and married adult who takes care of myself and my own with an involved and loving husband, but the idea of telling my parents \"no\" terrifies me and I just can't bring myself to do things that will probably burn bridges with them, such as changing our locks or reporting my dad for tinkering with our mail. So now I just take the longer path out of our neighborhood, trying to stay in the blind spot I know my parents' kitchen window has, pretend my phone is broken and sometimes doesn't ring when he calls, and go wherever. I guarantee my son has benefited from seeing more places and getting out to play more often, and I have benefited as well. My dad however, gets nearly apoplectic. I have tried to talk about it, but he asks me to \"compromise\" each time for his sake, but there is never anything for me in his supposed compromise.

The girl and myself are both 17. \n\nTL:DR at the bottom \n\n\nFor starters, we’ve know each other since we got to High School. It was always a chill thing, never super close. \nTwo years ago, she had a on/off thing with my best friend in a grade up. They were always never certain on anything. That changed when he moved across country. I was closer to her then, but still just acquainted. \n\nLast year however, her and I started to talk a lot more. She was always super spotty with texting back, but she said she was really busy and I went along. Summer break hit and as I tried to make plans, she’d leave me on read/opened constantly. I began to think of it personally. \n\nWe stopped contact until the start of 1st semester this year. We had a class together, right after lunch. I like to get to my classes a bit early on the first day, scope out who’s sitting where and make sure I can sit near someone I know. Where I ended up sitting, there was an open space right beside me. She walks in right before class started, sits down beside me and just starts talking to me like nothing at all. \n\nOver the course of the semester, we were close again. She again was still super spotty with responding to me. When my best friend came back for a week, she changed completely however. She was immediately responding to me, asking to hangout, etc. I took it with good graces, thinking she was trying harder. It was like that for a couple weeks, then she dropped off again.\nRight before winter break, we went on a trial-date of sorts and it went really well. I mentioned how I have a discount at a high-end restaurant because of some connections, so we went there. \nWinter Break hit, and she said she was travelling. I didn’t bother trying to talk to her as she said she’d have very little Wifi and such.\n\nShe comes back and we hangout a few times. She was always glued to her phone, never really paying any attention. I felt really bad about myself, thinking I did something wrong. \nWith 1st semester exams coming up, we didn’t talk as much due to studying. I was ok with that, still thinking I had done something wrong. Exams came and passed. We have no semester 2 classes together and she stopped responding to me completely. \n\nFinally a couple days ago she texted me asking if we go back to the restaurant for another date. I responded, with no reply for hours. Finally I texted my best friend to message her and see if she was just ignoring me. She replied to him immediately. I had had enough at that point and snapped at her, saying she only talked to me if she needed something. She swore me off, saying that I should know she rarely checks her phone and told me to never even look at her again. \n\nAITA or did I over-react?\n\nTL:DR, girl I know from school was very spotty with me. We had a kinda thing but she’d only respond consistently every so often. I called her out and cut her out of my life. AITA?",

I work as one of the IT managers for CompanyName in Mexico. 90% of my job requires of me to be in constant communication with our US office, therefore I am fully bilingual, and have a barely noticeable accent. As such, one of my co-workers, whom I didn't really speak with before, asked me to teach her English, so she could improve her own skills set. Apparently, she walked by my office one morning while I was on the phone, and I had left my door open. (irrelevant, but I have been an ESL teacher before)\n\nI agreed to do so, and our first class was to be on a Monday, 1 hour before my shift started. The night before, I spent a good hour and a half preparing a class for her. My daily commute is 2 hours to work, 2 hours back, so being at the office 1 hour earlier was a bit rough, but I am all for people wanting to better themselves, so I didn't mind it. Except she didn't show up. No call, no show.\n\nWhen she finally messaged me throughout the day, she apologized for oversleeping, and re-scheduled me for the next day, at the same time. She showed up 40 minutes late. The next two days she didn't schedule anything with me, and on the last day of the week, she finally showed up on time. This pattern has repeated as a mixed bag for about 7 months. I've gotten to the point of just not showing up whenever I think she won't show up either, and whenever I misjudge it, and she shows up but I don't, I apologize for oversleeping and carry on. I guess it is important to note I am not charging her for it. She stopped scheduling me all together about 4 months ago, but we've kept in touch and I guess we've become office friends. I try not to message her much while at work, or on our personal time. Every other week I'll send her a meme or a bad dad joke I found, but that's about it. She replies in kind. She's confided in me a few of her personal issues, and even made a few passes at me, all of which I blew off and ignored, since I know she has a boyfriend. A couple of months ago, she called me to vent after her breakup.\n\nLast week, she asked me again to help her with her English, and I agreed, but told her that if she was not constant and dedicated to it, there would be no way to improve or learn. She said she was 100% on board with that, and she wanted to start as soon as possible, but she didn't want to do it at the office anymore. She said she'd rather do it over the weekend at some Starbucks or w/e. She said that Sunday (today) would work for her, and we settled on that.\n\nYesterday, at around 1pm I asked her to confirm if we were still on for Sunday. She didn't reply, and I assumed Sunday was off, so I stayed up with my friends all nightp playing videogames. Today, at around 11am, she replied. It started off with her apologizing for not replying to me, then confirming the time and place for today. By noon when I finally got up, I replied, and told her I'd see her then. I asked if she wanted to grab a bite after, and she didn't reply, though the message was read.\n\nAbout 1 hour before we were to meet, she calls me, and cancels on me. Apparently she had JUST rolled her ankle and was on her way to the ER because she \"couldn't even see straight\". I offered to catch up with her at the ER, and she declined.\n\nWIBTA if I just made our relationship as \"coworkers\" only? That is to say, no contact unless it is work related? I feel she is now trying to use me to get her ex jealous or some other shitty deal I want no part of, on top of me being sick of investing time into helping her, when she very clearly has no interest. I don't understand why she'd ask me for help, schedule me, even assist a few classes, and continue to spontaneously cancel. Am I being petty?",

J also had a crush on me, so we started dating, and I stopped having a crush on B, for a few reasons (for one I was dating someone else and two I just wanted to be friends). \n\nSo yesterday B said that she has had a crush on me for a while and still does (she’s still dating K), and just said that she is really jealous of me and J, because B has had a lot of problems with K, and I’ve always been there for her. But she said that she knows J and I are happy together and that it would never work out if B tried to date me.\n\nWell I am a very empathetic person, and it always makes me feel bad to see someone else crying so I always try to help. She started crying about telling me and she felt really bad for having a crush on me, so out of empathy I said that I kind of have a thing for her too, but I don’t, because I’m dating J and I just don’t really like B in that way. I just felt super bad and knew it would make her happy, but it just feels weird, even though I don’t like her and haven’t liked for for like 2 months, even though I did like her before, and talk to her all the time still. \n\nTL:DR A girl who is taken told me, who is also taken, that she likes me, and started crying, so I told her I liked her too because I knew it would make her happier, even though I don’t like her, and we’re both taken. \n\nSo AITA here?",

I support legalisation of weed 100%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I think that people who smoke weed, while knowing it's illegal, should not be surprised, and angry when they get punished for it, because they consciously decided to break the law.

I don't want to smoke weed, but I like occasionally drinking alcohol, so to relate to the situation, I imagined that alcohol is banned, just like weed. I argued, that while I'd be just as outraged as them, I could hold myself back, because not breaking the law comes natural to me. (Just as a side note because I didn't include this in the argument: I have a pretty rebellious nature, and I like complaining about unjust things, but after several arguments, and fights with my parents, I learned, that complaining doesn't get me anywhere, it won't change the law, and it doesn't oblige me to break the law)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to seem like an ass, but I didn't really understand the arguments of the other side.

Growing up, the grandchildren, we (some of us) were close to my Grandmother during her weekly visits. Up till we were around 12-15yrs old. But then we all grew up and did our own thing - being usual asshole teens/young adults. My parents, they were not exactly what you would call filial. My mum would complain about my Grandmother being naggy or slow or troublesome. My dad wouldn’t / couldn’t stand up for his own mum. I think my parents are receiving the taste of their own medicine because we are also demonstrating some form of non-filialness towards them one way or another now.\n\nBack to my grandma. In the past 4-5 years, as she became incapable of caring for herself, she was bounced from one nursing home to another nursing home. I never understood why my parents or my uncle’s side could not get hired help and accommodate her at home. All the grandchildren were adults and living away from home, some overseas, myself included. So there was definitely space at home and they just had to do the necessary old person’s renovations. But no one bothered. \n\nFast forward to today:\nMy grandmother’s funeral.

My dad did too but in the last one year he did show some form of filial piety towards her (he regretted for not having a close relationship with her either due to personal reasons or because my mum is controlling of him like that).\n\nSo am i the asshole, for judging my siblings and mum for bawling their eyes out when they barely did anything / cared for her / even spoke to her much when she was alive?

I kept telling her that uh, no, I'm actually trans, and that isn't how it works. She didn't believe me, and started insisting I see a different therapist to get a \"second opinion\" on my own gender identity. She also tried to keep me from seeing my current therapist, who specializes in working with LGBT people and who I've seen for 3+ years, because she wasn't asking these questions and was just \"encouraging it\". At one point she even considered talking to my doctor to try and take me off my hormone replacements, which I've been taking for over two years.\n\nI was a complete wreck.

I was really hurt by all of this and I felt like a huge amount of trust had been broken. I'm constantly questioning how much she actually accepts me and I'm afraid to be as open with her as I used to.

First time poster here in AITA, but I feel like I'm going crazy and need some insight.\n\nHeres some background:\n\nMy boyfriend(M23) and I(F22) have been together for over 4 years. Back in October 2018 we moved states and got an apartment with his childhood/best friend(M20s). Let's call him C. I've only met and sparsely spoke with C so most of my knowledge of him has been through my bf. Theyve been friends forever so I figured he'd be a decent dude.\n\nJump forward to us all living together. We have a kinda small 2 bed 1 bath apartment. My bf and I in one room and he in the other. The only downside is how small our kitchen is. There's hardly room for 2 people to be in there at once and we have like zero counterspace.\n\nAnyways, I soon realized that C is super fucking messy. Which I wouldn't really have a problem with if he cleaned up after himself like at all. Cause I'm a messy person too but I grew up in a household where if you made a mess, you cleaned it up as soon as you could. Common decency when living with other people right? \n\nThis situation happens almost everyday. Im usually the first up in the morning to drink coffee and read in peace. I also clean the kitchen almost every morning. And by that I mean: load the dishwasher, handwash pots and pans, wipe down the counters and stove top and sweep. It maybe takes 20 minutes. No big deal at all. That is until later that night C comes in and makes the biggest mess. I'm talking pots and pans left on the stove with burned food sitting in them, 10 different bottles of spices on the counters, burned food and stuff all over the stove stop and counters I just cleaned earlier. Plus half the sink is full. You get the picture.\n\nSo when the kitchen is like this and I want to make food or basically do anything, I literally have to clean all this shit up because our kitchen is that small.\n\nAfter the first month of this I was so done. My boyfriend could definitely tell how upset this made me and tried to do whatever he could to help. But what I want is C do be a damn adult and clean up after himself. Is that so much to ask for? Do I really have to ask him to clean his own messes? My bf and I do all the other cleaning in the apartment as well. We vacuum and clean the bathroom and take the garbage out.\n\nThis is turning into a rant but I wanted to give as much info as possible. Do you think I'm being unreasonable for wanting to live in a clean place? I'm so tired of cleaning up after him and it's come to the point where my bf literally has to tell him to clean but even then it's half assed and we clean again shortly after.\n\nWhat are your thoughts reddit? Please tell me if I'm in the wrong and just need to suck it up. I honestly have no idea at this point. Thanks for reading",

Which I explain to the woman: she must be mistaken, because she's always in my range of sight, and she cannot really do her business not on the grass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman, however, insists, and when I ask why does she think it's my dog, she replies \"Because you're new here!\". Excuse me, lady, I ask, is that a reason enough to claim my dog shat in the apartment building? The fact I'm living here a few years less than you? \"Yes.\" she replies. \"Because I know everyone else in here, and no one would do that!\". Which is a weak argument, imo. Well, I tell her, she is mistaken - I kept a close eye on my dog, she didn't do it, so it must be something else. She continues to insist, tries to force me to apologise to the neighbours (tough luck - I'm a stubborn sonofabitch), and tries to drag me out to clean after \"my dog\", saying that everyone does that. Which I refuse because a) i'm in my PJs; b) that was not my fucking dog!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go home, lock myself, and go to sleep, only to be woken up a few more times by her for the same reason, but those times I did not open the door - just pressed a pillow over my ears, and slept to my heart's content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon the landlord came for the pay, and I asked him if the lady is even sane and should I bother about her? He said, no, but just motivated that she's a lonely old woman and a single mother with a forty-something daughter who is obsessed by cats... which is not a reason at all to call a woman crazy! Still, the landlord - spaghetti monster bless him! - likes to get to the root of any conflict I might have with anyone, and after a while he calls me, and tells that he spoke to the lady, they made a sweep of the neighbours, and it appeared that the guy next door was doing some renovations, changing pipes, some mucus and rot spilled out of the pipe he was carrying outside to dispose of, and that was the \"smelly puddle\". Alright, I think, the woman next time we meet would admit to her mistake and if not apologise, stop giving me The Look she has been ever since. But she did not. She did not apologise, she was continuing giving me The Look, she continued treating me and my dog as if we were the bane of the complex's existence, huffing and puffing, screaming at my dog whenever she approached (after a while the doggo adjusted and tried to be friendly with every person, pupper, or cat in the building), and continuously scolding me for not having her on the leash and muzzled at all times (which is not required for non-fighter breeds over where I live, and my doggo is just a happy, friendly mutt with some collie in her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for some reason i took that to heart. I stopped helping her, stopped holding the door, saying hello (which pisses her off - I hear how she grumbles about \"young people having no respect\" when i don't greet her), and other common courtesy. I just filter her out. But recently this cold war got to the point when, if I walk home, and see her walking from the store, I will deliberately walk slower, to get into the apartment building with a really nasty, hard-opening door (the magnetic lock misbehaves), to close it right in front of her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all wouldn't have happened were she only to say \"sorry\", or at least treat me decently. But it seems like the reveal of her being wrong only intensified her dismay, which I decided to mirror back to her. Not a very manly thing to do, I admit, but I am too stubborn to give up (not to mention it is kind of entertaining). Maybe **I** am the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** old lady neighbour claims my dog shat on the floor in the apartment building because I'm a new tennant (her words), and tries to force me to clean up and apologise to the neighbours; later finds out it was another person's fault, but still continues treat me and my dog as if we were ruining the complex; I decide to be petty and start slamming the doors into her face instead of holding them for her, and things like this.",

People work towards very stressful deadlines, and if you’re contributing as you should, there is almost zero downtime. This day, I had a very intense workload, as did the 5-person team I supervise. We were all stressed.\n\nEnter two coworkers, I’ll call them Rima and Lucy. Both are women in their mid-20s. I am not their supervisor, but was well-within earshot of them, as we have one of those terrible open office spaces. Their supervisor was leaving in two weeks and very much checked-out. \n\nRima (who has put in her notice) and Lucy, are  junior, hourly employees who have been chatting nonstop for about an hour. I know it’s not work related based on some words I pick up. For several minutes, I wait for their supervisor or another senior employee on their team to intervene, but none of them do. Most of the managers at my company are young, and many of them are very non-confrontational. I’m getting increasingly frustrated.\n\nI use the internal chat system to message a senior staff member in their row who ignores me. At one point, I go to the kitchen to get a snack, and another junior employee on their team complains to me that he can’t do his work because of the talking. \n\nAt that point, I go up to them in their row and say: “guys, the chatting has to stop. This is a common working environment.” They have guilty looks on their faces and stop talking, and I go back to my work. I told them off within earshot of their row, but with a normal speaking voice. Ie. Not excessively loudly. \n\nThe next day, I find out that Rima complained to the department manager, feeling like she was disrespected because she was “publicly shamed.” The manager tells me off about it, and tells me I should have brought them into another room and talked to them privately. I apologize for creating a situation my manager had to deal with, but told her I was on fundamental disagreement with her point of view.  \n\nMy opinion is that the burden of expectations should be on staff to act professionally, not for managers to disrupt their work flow to walk on eggshells around disrespectful employees. Besides, pulling them into a separate room would have been just as conspicuous given the office layout. \n\nI was certain I was in the right but when I vented about it privately to a friend of mine in the office also told me I was in the wrong. His opinion also bothers me, as he told me that I should have “used the opportunity to act as a female mentor to young women instead of berate them.” I find this attitude to be paternalistic (shouldn’t women my age be expected to be as professional as everyone else?), and puts an extra expectation of emotional labor on me, who already has a team to manage. I also have an odd sense that there is a gender dimension to this as I frequently tell the male members of the tech team to lower their voices when they’re talking about memes, but nobody has ever taken issue with that. \n\nAITA? \n\n\n",

I will try to be as objective as possible and not exonerate or vilify either me or the other guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth me and the guy are in first year university right now. Most of the stuff in this post occurred when we were in grade 12 (in the same school). Letters are hard to keep track of, so let's call him \"That Guy\" (DnD players, you will see why if you read on). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI first met That Guy when we were both in grade eleven, and although he never fully integrated into my friend group, I was pretty friendly with him and we often talked about random stuff like history (we were both interested) and games. I noticed that he was not the best at some aspects of communication; he would do things like interrupt people (I also had that habit but I fixed it after realizing), lying about trivial things, needlessly bragging, pretending not to hear people if he didn't want to hear what they had to say, and being slightly disrespectful to teachers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome examples: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe always lied about his grades; one time I literally saw that he got around 50% for a math test (by accident, since he left it on a table) while he bragged about a 96% to everyone. I later heard him complaining to the teacher about it. He boasted that he had many weapons at home (this might not be a lie, but I doubt he does because some of his friends went over to his house and didn't see any) and that his house's fence was \"impenetrable\" after sending me a picture of a fence that was from Google Images. He also pretended to know about things that he didn't, and one time, when I was clearly correct in an argument, he put on his headphones and pretended not to hear me. I tested him by asking what music he was listening to, and lo and behold, he could hear me and answered. He also didn't pay attention in class and refused to apologize to teachers when they called him out for it, even when they got legitimately angry. One time our English teacher (whom I liked, since English was my favourite subject) got pretty upset with him and his response was to discuss how English should be removed from the curriculum at lunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying I'm perfect either. Often, I continued to provoke him when I knew it would escalate a debate further, and sometimes I purposely asked him questions that I knew about but he didn't just to see his reaction. Still, we were on relatively good terms with each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problems began after two separate incidents. One was when he ruined a long-running DnD campaign that included me and one of my close friends by adding overpowered characters that completely derailed the plot and attempting to control other people's characters (he tried to kill most of the other PCs then got angry when his was put into fatal situations). Both my friend and I were quite angry about that. Remember that friend; let's call him Cool Guy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second was quite ridiculous when I look back on it. I helped him for a physics project even though I was not part of his group, and he began to ask me for help on his other assignments as well. I was fine with this until it got to his personal profile for university application. It was horribly written, was based on the standards from the wrong year, had blatant lies about his achievements, and included him claiming to own the DeviantArt account of a talented artist who was most definitely not him, since the artist had a twitter account that contained his photos and the fact that he lived in America (we live in Canada). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found this hilarious and openly mocked him about it. That was probably a douche move. He reacted by telling me not to tell anyone, which I promised to, but when I jokingly mentioned his personal profile offhandedly in a Discord server, he forced the owner of the server, whom we knew irl, to ban me from it and not add me back. I was quite pissed off about this because I never planned on showing anyone, but now I did. I showed everyone in my friend group, and they secretly showed other people they knew. That Guy was clueless about the fact that his personal profile got distributed like so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, I got interested in the life of a Nazi official, since he was the only high-ranking Nazi to be successfully assassinated and I love assassination stories (especially when they're justified). That Guy got very curious about this and tried to figure out who the man was - I would have told him, but he somehow got the conclusion that I was in love with the man despite the fact that he was evil, dead, and married. I am also asexual and almost aromantic. I tried to explain this to him multiple times, but he believed that having interest in someone's life meant that you had to have a crush on them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, he offered to tell me who he had a crush on if I told him who the man's name was. I agreed; since he was also telling me something, I could get him to promise not to tell other people. Less than a week later, the guy that he had a crush on (whom I was also acquainted with) asked me if I was in love with a Nazi. After I told him that this was not true, I asked him where he got the information from, and he told me that it was That Guy. I then told the dude that That Guy had a crush on him, and he ended up telling a lot of people as well. That Guy was clueless again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then privately confronted That Guy and told him that I would leak his personal profile and also the identity of his crush if   he ever talked about this again. As far as I knew, he didn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been avoiding him after that, but he keeps approaching my friend group whenever he sees us around campus. One time, I was drawing random stuff with Cool Guy when he appeared, and he told Cool Guy to draw a face based on his description. After Cool Guy did that, That Guy turned the face into an anti-semitic caricature and laughed at it for a solid minute before I left the room. By the way, this was in my sketchbook and in pen, so I had to scribble it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also keeps asking Cool Guy for his homework so that he can copy it, and Cool Guy was so nice that he agreed until I persuaded him to stop helping him at all. In context, it's a CPSC assignment and he refused two people's (one of which was Cool Guy, the other was another close friend) help to actually explain it to him so that he could do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is annoying and all, and I have been very curt to him whenever I see him, but perhaps I am in the wrong since I blackmailed and lied to him. However, he also slandered me and broke his promise. Who is the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this long-ass post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I leaked sensitive info about this guy after he got me banned from a Discord group, then leaked a secret he told me after he told everyone my secret and also slandered me. I blackmailed him with information that I already told everyone. He is not the best person, but neither am I.",

On mobile while the kids are having naptime, forgive any errors please. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy Great Grandpa(GG) recently turned 89. I am 29, turning 30 very soon. All my life I was the \"favorite\" grandchild of his, but I am pretty sure its just because my Grandma, (who raised me, and whose Father GG is), took me to hang out with him so often. But even if that was the reason, GG and I always had a good relationship. \n\nI have always been bigger then other kids and people my age, but it wasnt until maybe the past four years that I have slipped into the probably obese category. (I am not really wanting any advice regarding that, I know my issues there.) Between heavy depression, lack of care for myself, being content in a happy relationship, and PCOS, I have quite a bit of extra weight that is a struggle to lose. (But I am trying one pant size down this year! :3) Before this bit of weight gain, even though big, I was \"fat in the right places\" big. My GG used to creepily call me \"Hot Momma\" whenever I hugged him in public... Which was often as he always invited me out for lunch and dinner. I also spent a significant amount of time just hanging out with him at his house too. \n\nBut once I got properly fat, he stopped inviting me out as much, and whenever I would stay at his house he didnt really talk to me and just sorta acted awkward for lack of a better word. He would quickly finish dinner and be off to his \"man cave\" rather than socializing like he used to. We always go over to his house for Christmas, and for 2018 Christmas he decided to not give any of my family presents. (Husband and 15 year old daughter, as well as me.) I didn't say anything at the time, but all three of us sorta had our feelings hurt as he had made sure to give lots of other people presents, but somehow forgot us. \n\nThis was relayed to me by my Grandma later:\nMy Grandma asked GG if he had given me a present, and he grumpily said \"No, and I didn't give daughter or husband any either.\" He then told her that he didnt like me being around as much \"since I got fat\" because I make him, my 89 year old Great Grandpa, \"look bad\" and I am not \"hot\" anymore. \n\nOnce my Grandma told me about this I was livid and my feelings were so hurt I almost felt nauseous. I haven't said anything to GG as he's mostly deaf and really doesn't listen to me anyways. But since then... I have had no desire to go see him. I feel guilty about not doing it, I know he's old and doesn't have long but I just can't stand him at the moment. \n\nTL;DR \nAITA for not wanting to visit my Great Grandpa anymore after he said he didn't like having me around since I got fat and am no longer attractive in his mind, making him \"look bad\" in public? \n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.

I'm not comfortable explaining exactly what was up, but it's like if you're having issues with weird leg and foot pain that feels like pins and needles and you know your friend has diabetic neuropathy, even if you're not diabetic, you may ask them about neuropathy because neuropathy is nerve damage often in the hands and feet so it's vaguely related. So I asked my friend and they said my issue sounds like the beginnings of them being diagnosed with a certain condition, and I replied along the lines of \"Thank you for your help, but I hope it's not that\" because it's an incurable condition that from what I understand will continue to get worse and is also supposed to be pretty painful. My friend got super offended and started saying stuff like \"You don't want to be like me? Is it that bad to be like me you'd say that to my face?\"\n\nI don't get it. \n\nTo use another example but a real one this time, I have [trigeminal neuralgia].

It's totally normal to not want to have TN. In fact, if you want to have TN, there's probably something very very wrong with you. I totally understand not wanting to be like me in that I have TN. I don't want to have it either. \n\nThis could just be an issue of two people thinking very differently, but if it's not meant with any sort of \"I think people with X condition are lesser or inherently have a worse quality of life without me knowing what it's like to have X,\" I don't see the issue of stating in a conversation where it's relevant that you hope whatever you're experiencing isn't X. It's different to out of the blue say to someone you know has cancer or something that you're glad you don't currently have cancer like they do, for example.

She is amazing - intelligent, hilarious, and she's a great listener and conversationalist. For the first week, I was head over heels. \n\nWe've been spending a lot of time together. I'm an introvert and prefer one-on-one hangouts, but she texts me all day, every day, saying misses me or asking to hang out. Another problem is our budding relationship is almost.. overly physically intimate. I  know that that sounds like an absolutely crazy thing to complain about, but I can't get her to sit still for 5 minutes without kissing my neck or trying to get me to making out with her. That is not an exaggeration. Sometimes I just want to chill and enjoy her company and conversation. It's overwhelming.\n\nI'm not some hot model someone should be falling head over heels for. I'm not even a *super* sexual person... I enjoy sex, but have had abusive relationships in the past that make a lot of physical contact a bit stressful. It takes me time to feel comfortable with someone.\n\nThe most confusing part is that I've tried to tell her this. She told me she wanted me to always tell her whenever I was uncomfortable or needed space. Each time I've said so, she looks extremely hurt. If I told her every time I was uncomfortable/needed space, I'd be hurting her feelings all the time. Every other sentence she says is something about how much she likes me, or how handsome I am, or how obsessed she is with me. (She is a successful adult person, haha. She isn't sitting at home staring at a picture of me.)\n\nI don't want to hurt her feelings. Who asks someone else to kiss them and compliment them less? I'd be crushed if someone said that to me, but I really can't explain just how much of it is happening, and how uncomfortable it makes me. I'm not good at attention.\n\nThe last part makes me feel especially asshole-ish. She has an adorable dog, who is allowed into her bed. I don't automatically have a problem with that - the issue is that her bed is always *coated* in dog hair. I don't like being naked and coated in dog fur while trying to have sexytimes. On top of that, the dog (who is very big) whines if not allowed on the bed, which results in us trying to do the deed around it. I just feel weird fucking her with my thigh pressed up against her dog's ass. How am I supposed to say that without sounding like an asshole? She loves her dog more than life itself. How do I ask her to wash her sheets without sounding like a dick? Do I buy her a lint-roller? (Kidding.)\n\nTLDR: Amazing girl is super, *super* into me. Like, intensely so. Can't go five minutes without trying to make out with me. How do I ask her to back off without hurting her feelings? She asked me to be open but gets really sad whenever I do so. I was super into her but am getting overwhelmed. I don't want to sleep in dog hair. Might be shallow.",

I stayed with my parents and the first time I truly lived on my own was when I moved in with him a month ago.\n\nMy ex is absolutely awful with money. He spends it frivolously on eating out, alcohol, and before I encouraged him to get clean, drugs. But he is also a hard worker. When we got more serious, I started being a bit controlling and speaking up about his spending habits because he was always broke. Before we lived together, I helped him with rent on multiple occasions. I would have done anything for him, and if I had it, he had it. I admit towards the end I started being resentful because I felt like I was almost at time taking care of HIM when I wanted him, the guy, to take care of me...\n\nFast forward, our relationship ended abruptly and it got nasty. So much pent up anger and feelings reLeased. The only month I lived with him (first week of March), I paid my entire check from a new job I started. $900 (not a lot) of our $1200 rent. Unfortunately I was fired the very next day (no regrets, was being sexually harassed at work every day.)

I'm finishing undergrad early entirely out of my own drive.  I've told her time and time again that when she does this, it's belittling and demeaning.

No matter what I say, or the manner I say it in, anything I say to her just goes in one ear and out the other. I love my mother, and I'm grateful for everything she's done for me. But I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of being belittled. If it takes cutting her out of my life to get her to stop, I have no problems with doing so the moment I'm financially able to. ",

It's Super Bowl Sunday and the Lunar New Year (we're Vietnamese) is this coming Tuesday, so I thought it would be nice to spend some time with them. \n\nAs a full-time student and a part-time worker, I called out weeks ahead of time so I could make this visit. That being said, since I didn't have work this weekend, I thought that it'd be nice to finish up on this portfolio I'm working on since I don't normally get this much freetime during the week. For this portfolio I needed 10 of my best design pieces, a cover letter, and 2 essays. This seems pretty standard, but I'm taking this application very seriously as the program accepts only 30 students per year. And unfortunately this is something I have to do on the side, since my current classes and work are also a priority. Therefore I also had a couple of assignments to complete this weekend as well.\n\nSo on Friday night and all of Saturday, I basically worked my ass off doing as much work as I could, so I could do some more and on Sunday and be finished by the time the game kicks off. But earlier today, as I was still doing my homework the door bell rang and I discovered that my parents invited friends and family over for lunch and to hang out during the Super Bowl. This was something my parents didn't tell me about as I was expecting to have some alone time with them later tonight when we're watching the Super Bowl and having dinner. Since I was still busy with my work I kept myself shut in my room and didn't bother making menial small talk. \n\nIt wasn't until a bit when my parents came into my room and asked me to come out and hang out for a bit. I kindly declined, since I thought they would understand my circumstances. But after that, they would come back every 5 or so minutes to get me to come out and get some lunch despite how busy I was. But even then, I was indecent and still in my sleep wear, since trying to finish up my assignments was the first thing I did when I got up this morning. After a few more attempts, I finally snapped and raised my voice at them, enough to where (though not intentional) everyone in the kitchen and living room could hear me. I basically told my parents to leave me alone to let me do my homework and that I'll come out whenever I'm finished. They left, then my mom came back, brought food to my room, and has left me alone for the last hour or so. All I wanted to do was finish my work and watch the Super Bowl with my mom and dad, but I feel terrible about it as it must be embarrassingly awkward for their guests.\n\nOne half of me says yes I am the asshole, while the other says it was justified. Needless to say, I definitely could have handled the situation a lot better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tldr:** \n\nI came home to visit my mom and dad for the weekend, with a shit ton of homework due on Sunday along with portfolio work I needed to do to apply for a very competitive undergrad program. They had guests come over to watch the Super Bowl and celebrate the Lunar New Year, which I was not told about. After my dad was becoming very insistent on me coming out to have lunch with everyone, I raised my voice at him and told him to leave me alone so I could do my work.",

I mention that because maybe my behavior makes a bit more sense in context, but then again maybe not. Anyway: \n\nYesterday I was on a semi-crowded subway car headed back from work. Standing up, headphones in, as is my custom. It's a decently long commute and the whole time there's a youngish couple (guy and girl, mid-twenties) across the way from me, having what seems to be an increasingly heated argument. They're not speaking English but the guy in question is clearly upset, and appears to be the more aggrieved party. I mostly mind my own business. At some point, though, he gets to the point where he's full-on screaming at her. Very public freakout. To the level that a couple jokers actually have their phones out and are filming it and others are sort of hooting and laughing. \n\nNow, the guy's not big but his body language is more than a bit aggressive, and I notice that the lady is actually starting to cry. Soooo... in what I think is an unobtrusive manner, I sidle up to the guy and say, *\"Hey dude, take it easy OK?\"* \n\nI don't touch him or anything, but predictably he shifts the full brunt of his anger to me and starts cussing me out, telling me to mind my own fucking business bitch, etc etc. Maybe not being a dude saved me from a full-on ass-kicking, but who knows. I didn't really try to defend myself, apart from continually telling him to calm down. It's difficult to read the vibe in the car at that point, but I can readily tell that nobody has my back in this. \n\nI get a teensy bit of satisfaction when he exits at the next stop (his apparent girlfriend goes and sits in the far corner), but mostly I immediately feel like a raging douche. Several people give me a sort of eye-rolly dismissive look that indicates they agree. One helpful gentleman politely tells me that doing that kind of thing is a bad move and I really should mind my own business, especially when it's between a couple like that. \n\nSo at present I feel like way less of a good samaritan and way more of a busy-body asshole. I also don't know why I felt the need to step in in that instance when I know I'll be obliged to ignore all kinds of equally disturbing behavior on public transport in the future.

I wanted to defer, but my father vehemently denied me that right. \n\nFor even more context that led up to what my father said. Over the past three and a half years, I got put into a boarding school I didn’t really like, but put up with regardless. I’ve never really had a healthy relationship with my father, as I’m always terrified of his volatile temper, and he was almost never willing to spend time with me as a child. However, he did work to provide me and my family with a comfortable life. At that boarding school, I was overwhelmed with the workload I had to face since I never had to study to get top grades (I only went to international schools before), and asking teachers and friends for help has always been extremely uncomfortable for me. This in turn led to my studies not being great, and me getting a very average ATAR of 61.70. However, I was still able to get into the course I wanted.\n\n\nNow, I haven’t been the best child, but I was never the worst. I had never gotten detention, had never handed in a late assignment, and had never gotten into trouble with teachers. The worst thing I had done at school was not ask teachers for help and not put in as much effort as I should have. The worst thing I did to my parents was steal some money from their credit card, which is awful as is - however, I don’t think it warranted my father telling me to kill myself. He constantly tells me that I wasted three and a half years of my life, that he wasted money on getting me tuition, and that I put him and my mother under stress that no other parent has to face. He also claims I’m the reason they’re so close to divorce. He also sometimes calls me an useless moron and that I’m the most lazy and awful person he’s ever known. A few days ago, I fucked up researching housing costs for my university, and he lost it. He proceeded to yell all of the above at me, and then said, without paraphrasing, “A few months ago you told the bloody counsellors that you wanted to kill yourself? Well maybe you should have killed yourself then, it would have been easier on all of us.” I started crying really badly and he yelled at me asking why the fuck I was crying and I said through tears that he told me to\nKill myself, and he said “You’re goddamn right, you don’t deserve to live anymore, go hang yourself tomorrow.” The next day my mom told me I should feel guilty because I hurt my dad so much and that I should feel bad for making him say those things, and that I should look past it. Again, the extent to which I “hurt” my parents was listed above. A few days later I got my acceptance letter, and two days later I told my parents I wanted to defer. My dad lost it again, asking me who the fuck I am to have the arrogance to defer, and that I should be taking this god-given gift and studying hard, rather than fucking deferring, and that I should go fuck myself.\n\n\nSorry if this is a rambling mess, I’m on mobile and don’t really know how to format. I believe I’ve covered everything on both sides, so please let me know if clarification is needed. I really want to run away from my parents and start over, but because I’m 17 my father is still controlling me and forcing me to start university immediately. I feel bad because I have done some things that are wrong, but I don’t feel they’ve warranted what’s been said to me. In short - am I the asshole here?\n\n",

All of our contact has been through messages sent back and forth. We both handle our problems very differently. I am a person who will apologize quickly, so I lash out once I truly lost my patience and she is more the person who will wait until something blows over.\n\nSo we have had a small argument about something insignificant a few days ago. I decided to swallow my pride and apologize to her. I thought I did so in a very carefully constructed way, telling I should not have done the things I did and that I was sorry. She did not respond. It might have been her way of handling the argument we had. Cooling down before sending a message, so that it would not be written out of anger. I decided to text my mom asking if I had done anything wrong.\n\nAs time went by, I was getting more annoyed, since I was the one reaching out and swallowing my pride. I did not want to show any of this anger to my sister though, since we have always been very close and me hurting her might sent her back into mental instability. I ended up venting a lot of my anger towards my mother and saying that I want my sister to apologize to me. She managed to calm me down and I went to sleep. \n\nThis morning, I saw that my sister had sent some messages and I was secretly hoping they were apologies. However, These messages were just to show her side of the story and telling me she does not want to include our mother in our arguments. Then there were some casual messages afterwards to try and end this entire situation. This almost broke my patience, since I felt the only reason I included our mother was to protect her from myself. Additionally, she still ignored the apology message I had sent the night before. I sent one message saying that I did not like it that she ignored my apology, because I had to use a lot of self-control to type it. I think it might have been her way of putting this entire situation behind her and moving on. I feel that I need her to at least say that she appreciates that I apologized.\n\nNow I feel like I might sent some hurtful messages if I contact her again, since my patience is almost spent, but I still want the opinion of others. She was right that I should have not included our mother, but the situation gnawed at me and I had to get a second opinion. \n\nSo now I would like to ask you guys: Am I the asshole by saying I want her to acknowledge my apology?",

One friend, \"Mitch\", somehow got very drunk during the concert (we were all drinking, but he was especially drunk at the end) and suggested we go back to his place to play some Jackbox Games. \n\nI expressed hesitation because I had a feeling that if he was this drunk, it meant that he would pass out early. He insisted that he was fine. We talked about getting food before leaving but everyone said they weren't hungry. Eventually, I agreed to go to Mitch's place with my husband, \"Caleb\", and the other guy, \"Rob\". I hailed a cab off the street and then we went to Mitch's place in Queens. Tip + fare is \\~$24. \n\nWe get there and Mitch is alternately smoking (on his balcony) or talking about making Vietnamese noodles. He gives Caleb and I a beer... to split. I'm frustrated so I tell him we came there to play games so sit his ass down and stop talking about noodles. We play approximately two games before he falls asleep on the couch. \n\nCaleb, Rob, and I play another game while Mitch is asleep but they're really much better with four people so we head back to our respective places via Lyft. \n\nThe next day, I get a text (on the group text with Mitch, Caleb, and Rob) from Mitch asking everyone to each pay him $6 for the cab to his place. I sent a text back, \"No, that's part of being the after party host\".  A couple hours later, I get a request from Venmo for $6 (as did Caleb). I send another text explaining that I wasn't kidding, I'm not paying and that if we had gone back to our place, we would've paid for the cab. This dissolves into an \"epic\" text fight where neither of us are understanding how the other doesn't get that they're being ridiculous. My main argument is that he is asking to pay $6 to get home, while Caleb and I would pay a total of $26 to get home ($12 for the cab to Mitch's plus $14 for the Lyft). His argument is basically we split the cab, so we should split the fare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Additional info that may be relevant:**\n\n* We are all well paid professionals - with Mitch making the second highest single salary out of the four of us (so it's not about needing the money).\n* We regularly host people at our place, and buy all the beer/wine and snacks. We don't ask for reimbursement. \n* Mitch also hosts, but is generally less likely to have beer to share.\n* From Mitch, Rob lives slightly less than a mile away and Caleb and I live about 2 miles in the other direction.\n* I was convinced that I was not the asshole here, but we recently met up with Mitch for the first time after this fight and he (and Rob) expressed total confusion that I thought I was in the right. We're no longer fighting but I wanted to make this post to see once and for all who is in the right. I will accept the outcome either way, and will show the post to Mitch as well. \n* We never paid him the $12\n* I asked my husband to chime in on the text battle and he responded dryly \"It seems like you've got it handled\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I just felt like this was something no one talked about, so I'm attempting to now. I've only recently actively looked into this sub, but I've fleetingly seen posts for quite some time now that have really grabbed my attention. People seem to write in often where the scenario they depict is almost too outrageous and ridiculous to believe, or they seem very obvious that OP would is NTA. It really looks like people take the catharsis to a little too close heart, and forgot that honesty and transparency is needed in order for any of the resolution to be genuine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only outlook I have in these evident posts being genuine is kind of a cynical one. It's sad to say, but I think it's really possible there are plenty of people who really don't know or know how to expect someone close to them to be a decent human being with fairness and compassion. They often land themselves with people who aren't worth a damn because they don't know they deserve better or the right to fight for improving their quality of life with family if they've truly been wronging you. I really hope that's not the case, but, either way, it boils down to the conditioned inability to stomp out the bullshit, or you being the one creating it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't doubt that many of you have candidly presented yourselves as unbiased as you could, but, what's funny is that no one has pointed out how absolutely absurd it is to expect someone to \"depict both sides of the story\", like the sub states. You will always be speaking for the other person. No matter how bipartisan you are about the ordeal, phrasing is everything, and anyone can tell a story differently without changing the events to make themselves the victor and the other the villain. These nameless people the OP has conflict would almost always have a better chance at gaining favor or defending themselves if they were able phrase things the way they wanted to, or at all for that matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the other extreme, there's nothing stopping anyone from making up a dishonest, slanderous story to reap the affirmation they might desperately desire to quell their unchanging, narrowed outlook on any given situation. I don't blame them to be honest, because it seems like something we all do to some extent. Reddit, and social media in general is a great place to escape to and experience a rare and odd form of gratification, especially in the way you present yourself to other people. You get to control how much or how little you want someone to know, and since verification of these types of \"text only\" stories doesn't really exist, there's nothing stopping you from completely inflating your ego and confirming how \"right\" you are, even at the expense of the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is in no way a novel concept, but I feel I really need to say that some things are better left unsaid if they can't be told sincerely. If you need some kind of break from reality or can't face the decisions you make, that is entirely your choice and freedom to do so. I just don't think it serves any kind of long-term benefit to pose as these relatively innocent, guiltless people if that's not how you exist in the real world.",

I talked with him for a little bit (30 mins) about what he was trying to do and if it would work.  \n\n\nHe asked if I could help him implement the solution to the problem, and/or talk with me further.  \n\n\nI asked is this for the department, or was this a personal project?

He said that this project will provide a platform for learning to all the students, which he is right about, the results of the project would help a lot of students, so I am unsure if I'm being selfish.  \n\n\nAnd as soon as I dropped the bomb of \"pay me for this\" he said \"if you ever needed help at your job I'd help you.\" Which, yeah, that's true.

            "input": "Throwaway because I’m honestly a little ashamed to be telling this story/asking this question. It’s long, I’m sorry. I’m trying to be thorough. \n\nA little backstory: shit’s been rough lately. I used to be very outgoing, very spunky, had many friends. I ran a small local business and was very involved in the community. I’ve never had many problems with friends before, at least not on my end (that anyone has told me about at least). I made friends relatively easily—though I was still picky and cautious about who I let get super close to me—and have never been the kind of girl who’s a gossip or has big falling outs with friends or lots of drama. For the most part, my friendships (definitely the close ones) last a long time...like years, decades long. \n\nBut almost three years ago I was in an accident and it fucked everything up. I broke my spine and got a brain injury. I’ve already had one surgery and we’re waiting on number two. I had to move back in with my parents and temporarily close my business. I cannot do a lot of basic things for myself...including bathing. It’s been extremely hard on me, not just physically, but also mentally. To add to the craziness, I was recently diagnosed with cancer, and then almost immediately after, sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. It’s been a ride, y’all. \n\nBut over the last few months I’ve lost **everyone,** and I don’t know why. \n\nThree of my very best and closest girlfriends have straight up ghosted me. These girls helped me through my first surgery two years ago no problem. These were the girls who were my cheerleaders and helpers for my business, who threw me surprise birthday parties and called me when shit was going down in their lives. I thought we were ride or die. But when I asked girlfriend 1 (we’ll call her Micha) if she still had pictures of her wedding cake that I made for her a few years back, her answer was oddly distant and cold. When I tried to reply, I was blocked. No hints, no conversation, just blocked. \n\nI asked girlfriend 2 (let’s call her Kelly) about it to see if she knew what was wrong, and she brushed it off. “I think Micha was scared because you mentioned committing suicide (over a year ago).” This didn’t make any sense. Micha was the girlfriend I’d had the longest of the three, and she saw me through a horrible breakup in college where depression and suicide was mentioned. I did the same for her about a year later. That had never been a spooky topic before. And besides, that comment had happened over a year ago. I figured she just must need space and dropped it. \n\nThen maybe a month later, Kelly says life is too busy to continue talking to me, and she wants a break. She sends that message to me and at least one other mutual friend. I didn’t take it personally at the time because she was pulling away from everyone, not just me. I was concerned for her, but I wanted to respect her wishes so I told her that I loved her and whenever she was ready to chat and hangout again I would be here. \n\nBuuuut a month-ish after that is when my doctor first said “you might have cancer, I’m sending you to an oncologist.” I was freaked the fuck out. I felt so alone and scared and I didn’t want to tell my parents because it wasn’t a definite yet and I didn’t want to worry them. I needed my best friend so badly. So I called Kelly. She didn’t answer (which I expected), so I left her a tearful voicemail apologizing for calling and saying that I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful and invade her space, but the doc says I might have cancer and I was very scared. I just wanted a hug, honestly. She never returned my call. \n\nGirlfriend 3 (Nancy) moved to another state about a year ago, but we still stayed very close. Sending big birthday packages, long chats, lots of pictures back and forth and keeping each other very involved. She was supposed to be coming home soon and promised to visit, as my place is right down the road from her parents. But suddenly she stopped messaging too, around the same time as Kelly. I finally sent her a text that just said “Nancy, I have something important to tell you.” after the diagnosis was confirmed. She said “So do I. You go first.” I asked her if she could FaceTime, but she said she was still at work, so I said that was fine we can chat when she gets off or tomorrow, whatever works best for her. I never heard back. \n\nI sent all three girls a “wtf is going on” message one tearful night not too long ago. It was long, and probably overwhelming (in fact I sent an apology for the length the next day) but honestly, for a “best friend” it shouldn’t have been some crazy message. I told each of them my diagnosis and that I’m truly at the lowest of the low right now. I feel like I’m trapped in this shell of my body and there’s nothing I can do. I begged them to please tell me what I did wrong to make them ghost so I can fix it. I pleaded with each of them not to leave. But I also told them that they really hurt me, and I felt like I have been abandoned by those that I trusted the most during my deepest tome of need. I sent this individually over Facebook messenger because I naively thought that maybe I wasn’t getting replies because their phones were dead or something. I have been left on read for all three of them, and Micha deleted me as a friend immediately after reading my message. \n\nI don’t know what to do guys. All I can think of is that saying “if you keep smelling dog shit everywhere you go, maybe you should check your shoes.” Please tell me, AMITA? I’m so fucking mad at them. I would never straight up ghost a normal friend, never mind a best friend. *Especially* after they tell me that they have cancer, godfuckingdamn. It feels so shitty and I’m honestly more torn up about it than I am about the cancer.   \nI can provide more details if you want, I just didn’t want to make this longer than it already is.

I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something.

I have no problem driving him around because he contributes to the payment, but his family is becoming an issue to me. For the record, I like his family, but they do not help him out in any way.

He's always bending over backwards to help her out and it's not been an issue, but it is now since we're using my car. \n\n   We always have to pick several members of his family up for any family events because hardly anyone has cars, which adds an extra 30 minute drive to the location. Last week his mother got dropped off at our work asking us to take her home after I had already told BF, \"No, I'm tired and want to go home already.\" So we had to drive an extra 20 minutes just to take her home after working an 11 hour shift. He says we have to because he pays part of my payment, but I feel like that doesn't cover his family's expenses and they're taking advantage of us.

However when my first paycheck arrived I realized I'd actually gotten around $20aud per hour. Keep in mind that the job I took was cash in hand (not taxed) so there was no contract or anything like that. I realize that working cash in hand makes me somewhat of an asshole in and of itself but since I'm here very short term I'm not in a position to say no to work. I went to the owner (who handles everyone's paychecks) and confronted him about it. He told me that everyone in fact gets $20aud in the beginning but when he sees that they can carry parts of the bar themselves he would raise the salary to $25aud per hour. I wasn't happy being lied to but accepted it and figured I'll just put the hours in until he bumps up the salary.\n\nNow for a while I've been able to work easily on my own, taking care of the bar without help. So I sent a message to my boss a couple of weeks back asking when the rate would go up. It was left ignored so I went to talk to him about it and he scoffs and says he's busy (he is not a very pleasant guy) . I later heard from a workmate that actually everyone gets paid $20 an hour and the owner has no intention of paying anyone $25. \n\nI felt like I had been misled from the beginning and have started to skim some cash from the register, just enough to cover what would have been my promised $25 per hour (literally, I don't take more than that) . The method I take the money is in a way that still makes the numbers add up, it just looks like the restaurant is making slightly less profit. I feel a little bit dirty taking money all the time but at the same time I feel it's fair. I'm only working at the place for another month, before I move back home so I don't exactly have time to find another job. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here? Or am I right to steal? ",

Although I appreciated the gesture, I explained that I don’t think I would want to visit a place that is so cruel to its animals and was surprised he didn’t know the living conditions of the animals there. He got defensive and said that Sea World rescues animals from the ocean and that it’s hypocritical of me to say all this when I eat meat (he’s sort of a pescatarian—only eats sushi a couple times a year). He said he had already spent the money and the ticket isn’t refundable, so either way, Sea World has already benefited from the money whether we like it or not and we might as well go if that’s the case (he said we won’t have to eat any of the food there and won’t buy any souvenirs—essentially we won’t be giving them any more money than he’s already spent).\n\nStill, I don’t feel right going to Sea World because I don’t support the establishment.

That's why the following situation kind of surprised me. Using a throwaway account because I'm not super proud of myself.\n\nSo before I continue, I need to tell you that I've always felt insecure about my looks, and my average height and average build - or even below average growing up. I've always had interest in sports and all things considered \"masculine\" but I've often been left out of matches, sporting events, bachelor parties etc because I've always tried fitting in with the more masculine tough guys, and although they've always been formally nice to me, I don't think anyone has ever seen me as their peer. I've learnt to accept it, but it's always been a mild frustration for me.\n\nSo about two and a half months ago I joined a new firm, and everyone has been pretty welcoming, inviting me over for a drink after work etc, but I've started noticing the same pattern. Guys playing sports over the weekend don't invite me, or don't take my comments about sports, or relationships etc seriously... Again the big guys have their own circle where I don't feel like I fit in. But there is this one guy who's been very friendly, helpful and overall did everything he could to help me adjust to the new environment. Now, this guy is about my age, maybe a few years older, everyone at the office likes him, he's a great worker, and physically he's very imposing, tall, good looking, well built... everything I've always wanted to be, and more than anyone I've known he's shown interest in my opinions about sports, politics, relationships etc, and he's invited me to matches, sporting events and such. I know it's childish, but this really made me feel like I was finally accepted into the \"boys club\" after feeling left out for most of my life, because I didn't look right, or wasn't tall enough, confident enough, or whatever it is that someone did or did not see in me.\n\nSo a few days ago we went for a beer after work, a couple of us colleagues, and after everyone else went home, my new friend and I talked about women and relationships for a while, and it turns out he's gay. I've never had a close gay friend, only a few good acquaintances I share with my girlfriend, and like I said earlier, I've always supported and respected the LGBT community. But I have to admit that I was kind of disappointed that this guy is gay, because I've always wanted to have at least one friend like him, who would share my interests and who would accept me as I am, but I always assumed it would be a str8 guy. Am I the asshole for being disappointed here, or am I just overthinking this?",

The only time she might actually clean the house is if we have company over, but since we live out in the sticks that's maybe a couple times a year.\n\nNow, I'm by no means Howard Hughes-levels of neat freak, but I do like to keep things at least reasonably tidy and organized. I tend to work less hours (although right now I'm working on-call and a SAHD) so I'm ok with doing the majority of the general housework, but it still bothers me that I'm constantly picking up after her.\n\nCase in point: a couple days ago I did a deep clean of the kitchen; washed all the dishes and scrubbed down the stove and counter tops. After she got home from work she made dinner (which was mostly leftovers anyways) and then had an impulse to do some baking. Now, I'm a proponent of the \"if you cook, they clean\" rule, but within reason. By the end of the night there was a full load of dishes and the surfaces were worse than they were before I cleaned them.\n\nMaybe this will come across as crazy, but the little stuff sometimes bothers me more than the big things. This morning she left some crumbs on the counter (that I had just re-cleaned yesterday after the previous mess) from making breakfast. Now, it only took me a few seconds to sweep the crumbs off the counter and throw them away, but it bothers me that she couldn't be bothered to take the few seconds to do it herself. Or the damn pull tabs from the milk cartons that just sit on the counter top for days until I finally take the few seconds required to throw it away.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the endless battlefield that is the kitchen table. She insists on using the table as her home office, because her actual home office is too cluttered to be used as such. In several homes we have been in, she has used the table as a dumping ground for her stuff, even though in one home she would have to walk past her office room and open a baby gate to get to the table, and in another walk down 14' of stairs and yet again open a baby gate. I just don't understand how someone can exert MORE effort to make a mess than to not.\n\nNow if I'm not already, this might be the point that I officially become the asshole. Her mom is a hoarder. Not to the point that you'd see on the TLC show, but still pretty bad. I'm starting to realize that my wife might not know what \"cleaning up after yourself\" even means. Granted, I spent most of my formative years in a similar environment (more dilapidation than hoarding) and I think it my stress is related to that, but it my be comforting for her in a way.",

My mother comes in, obviously wanting to talk about the meeting she'd had the day before with my maths teacher (about me missing way too many classes and my grades dropping.) She asked - in a sweet voice that made me want to punch her in the face (goes to show how weirdly I've been reacting these days) - why I'd been missing those classes, listing off potential reasons. I'd had a less than ideal day, so I just wanted to be left alone, and I got annoyed really easily. I snapped. \n\nUnfortunately she just cranked up the whiny tone. Started talking about how hard this was for her (which I get, honestly, but in that moment I wasn't hearing it), and eventually she said the magic words \"I want to die from how tired I am because of you.\" \n\nI was too mad at that point to watch my mouth so I just asked her \"why not do it, then\" in a complete deadpan. I wasn't looking at her so I'm not sure what her immediate reaction was, but when she next spoke I'm pretty sure I heard choking up. \n\nI felt nothing in that moment. That's what makes me so conflicted. I didn't even think in that moment, I let myself go and stooped to her level. Said the words she used to say to me. Afterwards, thinking it over, I felt bad - not for her, not really, but for having been that much of a shithead to anybody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two entirely different parts of me that are at odds right now.

And she's been trying to do better, I'm just actively making it hard for her. That's definitely asshole material. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I need help in figuring this out.

I was unemployed for eight months while studying for a new career path and needed a lot of help from my parents.

I'd have to keep an extra $500 of my money sitting in my account so the checks would go through, and some months I'd have to ask where rent was and he would suddenly come up with excuses why he could only pay a portion.

He didn't bother asking what it was, and didn't pay until I asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne morning when I woke up to $10 in my bank account, I lost it. He was working, so I texted him a long message about how I expected rent NOW, and how I didn't understand how he never has money even though I'm fully aware of how much money he makes. He pulled the \"but I helped you when you needed it\" card, like I owed him for it. I shot back with how I paid everything back, and I didn't use help more than a handful of times.

One day BF sends me a post from EBF's close friends list saying \"HUGE SHOUT OUT TO MY BEST FRIEND NATHAN FOR BLOCKING ME ON EVERYTHING\" and all the sides were just her showing screenshots of her not following/added on my social media accounts, then I go to text her why did she just stop talking to me all of a sudden, the response she gave me was really childish and didn't even give me a proper straight answer when I first asked her, so when I asked her to tell me why she did again, she said that she needed some times and that she can't always be talking to everyone, the thing that really tipped me over the edge was the fact she started talking to BF even though she said that she wasn't emotionally able to talk to a lot of people even though it's still the same amount of people. We went on and argued a bit then eventually she started saying that I need to think about her more instead of just thinking about how I feel and she tells me that I'm being selfish. I eventually get tired of the whole argument I then say that I should just next time I should understand what and why BF choose to do whatever she's doing and I need to stop being entitled, then she responds with almost the same thing I said to an extent. After this I got so annoyed at myself because I thought I messed up and I'm a complete joke and other self deprecating stuff, then for a bit I went into this stage where I was like \"yeah I'm in the right she was being a massive bitch screw her she doesn't matter to me anymore\" but I feel like I've come full circle but instead I feel awful about this.\n\nThese are the screenshots, I wasn't able to get all of the screenshots of the argument, I lost one or two screenshots but I only have the beginning and the end of the argument.",

He’s expressed that big social gatherings bother him and that dances/parties especially aren’t his scene.\n\nWe’re in highschool and there are homecoming dances. I’d gone the previous year with friends, before I’d met my boyfriend, and decided to go this year as well. Two weeks before the dance, I’d texted my boyfriend, asking if he’s gone to past dances since he’s in a higher grade. He tells me no and asks why I asked, and I tell him it’s because I wanted to know if I’d be going with friends or him as a date in advance. He was unsure and the convo stopped there. \n\nFlash forward two weeks, the day of the dance. I’m getting ready and receive a text from him. He asks if I’m attending the dance and I say yes. I get a very typical “oh, nevermind,” response. I press a little and he ends up flipping the fuck out. He immediately asks why I hadn’t asked him to be his date, and why he was finding out last minute I was going. I told him I’d mentioned it two weeks prior and didn’t bring it up again because I didn’t want to pester him. I’m terrified of bothering somebody so close to me. My anxiety makes me 100x more bothered by rejection, especially from my own partner. He tells me “I’m at a tournament stressing about this because you didn’t want to use your big girl words.” (He’s an extremely dedicated wrestler. Tournaments are every weekend and it’d take something super important for him to miss one.) \n\nBy now I’ve left home. I ended up repeatedly apologizing for not making my desire for him to be my date clear and spent most of my dance time worriedly checking my phone notifications. I asked how I could prevent this from happening in the future, to which he gave a condescending “Speak up. That is quite literally what needed to happen. A concept instilled in four year olds because they’ll hurt themselves and not say anything.” That combined with the big girl comment left me extremely hurt but I gave up trying to defend myself because every reason seemed like bullshit to him. \n\nHalfway through the dance, he asks where I am. Somehow he’d gotten entry. We sat down and talked more, and he was noticeably calmer. A few off topic things were mentioned and I’d asked why he even approached me when we first met, and he claimed it was a friend’s dare. This killed my self esteem, which he knows I already struggle with heavily. I told him that later that night and he admitted he lied about it being a dare make somebody feel worse than he was (because he’d lost the tournament? Which anybody would be upset by.)\n\nBasically, AITA for not formally asking him straight up to go to the dance with me? Or was it blown out of proportion? My friends think his reaction was completely uncalled for and that his words were beyond hurtful, but I feel as though none of this would’ve happened if I just had the balls to be direct. ",

One day, he told me it was time to renew the lease on the apartment for 6 months.

We wanted to get a house first because my son was about to start kindergarten. We didn’t want to have the wedding and then save another year to get the house in another city and then have to transfer him.\nAnyway, well when I proposed to her. We set a date shortly after to be dated to 2 years later. I told my family and everyone that asked about it the date. WELL, apparently not everyone. Just recently my real brother came to me about some information that my STEP brother was planning to propose to his girlfriend of like 4 months. She already knew about the ring because he showed her it when he got it but hadn’t officially proposed yet. (Don’t ask me why he did that because I don’t know why either.) Anyway, I told my real brother “Okay? So what?” He then tells me the date they chose, it was exactly 1 week before ours! They were also using the exact same colors as ours too! I told my real brother, no way they’d do that to us. So I kept my cool about it and we had a family get together and everything was fine. My step brother didn’t bring up anything about it. A few days later I look on Facebook and they posted about the proposal with the exact date my real brother told me about. My fiancé and I are furious! I call my Dad about it and he says he can’t talk right now (he’s with them) so he’ll call me back. I say okay and a few hours go by and he texts me telling me to call him tomorrow which of course makes us even more mad. Because when something like this happens, we like to talk about it right there and then. So I ignore his call the following day because the previous day I was so mad I had to take an ibuprofen and didn’t want a repeat of it. So I call him the next day and I couldn’t believe the words he was saying. Without going into detail he kept defending my step brother over me. He tells me they planned everything including the date before they told my dad and step mother. Even though my step brother and his girlfriend both knew when our wedding was. My dad told me to get over it and it’s “not a big deal” and that if I “keep pushing it, he’s not coming to my wedding.” My dad is my best man by the way. I told him “well that’s fine” and he hung up. My argument is this, what family member does this to another family member? Like, who intentionally rains on another family member’s parade?

Sorry for ambiguous title, let me know a better one so I can improve my posts.\n\nContext: my gf (25f) and me (27m) have been together since her first year of university. I was her first sexual partner, she was my second. She had a bf before me in highschool, but they never had sex.\n\nLet me first sketch the context and then I'll get to my dilemma.\n\nThrough the years, a few things happened that pushed my gf in some kind of depression. She went out a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot. Eventually, her mom and me convinced her to go see a therapist, which helped a lot. She got through it a few years ago.\n\nHowever, during this period of depression, she got drunk once and kissed another guy. She confessed the next day, we got into a fight but I found it in myself to forgive her. She told me that part of her was sad that she never had a truly wild period because she met me so early on and this also influenced her action.\n\nAnother thing about my gf is that she can be either really passionate about friends or not at all, and that she easily becomes friends with guys. She always kept me in the loop and told me if she was feeling attracted to other guys. I also sometimes feel attracted to other girls, but we don't act upon it so that's fine. These tight friendships usually only last a couple of months after which they sizzle down, either to regular friendships or to just acquaintances. A few guys are also friends with me who I trust so I am 99% sure nothing happened.\n\nCue to last year. During the summer, she met a guy while she was on holiday while I had to work. She became tight friends, and when she got home she told me about him. During the next month, she is texting him a lot, which isn't that unusual but every time I glanced at her phone when she was near me, she would turn away or close her phone. I mentioned this to her and she claimed that she doesn't like being checked and that she always does that. I admit that I only noticed it because I was already feeling a bit suspicious, so maybe that part was true.\n\nA week or so, my suspicions had grown a lot and I took the low road: I checked her phone (I know, asshole move). In their texts, he talked about how he loves her and she talked about missing him. She said that she liked him more than she wanted, but that they could never be a couple because she is together with me and she didn't want to give up a 7 year relationship for a fling. I only read a bit since my emotions were acting up, but I am 100% sure they didn't have sex since she told him she doesn't want to. I don't actually know if they kissed, she said no but I don't know if I can trust her. We got into a huge fight, but in the end I decided to let things cool of. The fight came up again and I said that I don't trust her completely anymore, she admitted that she still regrets never having a fling or sex with another man. In the end we decided to split up for 2 months and see where we stand afterwards. Since this is such a big issue for her I don't think we'll get through it if I don't at least let her experience what single life as an adult is like. She told me I am also free to do what I want, it doesn't bother her according to her. I don't have any interest but she sounded sincere at least. I told her I don't know how I'll react and that's a risk she is going to have to take.\n\nWe are currently 1 month into the break (insert Ross gif). I am still not trusting her again completely, and I am not sure I ever will. The thing is, I still love her very much and find it hard to imagine life without her. The reason for my trust issues is that I am an insecure person and I am afraid she will either fall really in love with the guy from holiday or find someone else that she loves more than me. I know that can happen with anyone, regardless of context and history, but I can't get over this feeling it seems. I'm trying to, maybe I can someday, but maybe not.\n\nI know I have only told my side of the story. I know I am a quiet person and not very passionate about anything (just who I am, maybe autistic traits but never tested). I do try to show her I love her but she does accuse me of never coming up with or organizing something exciting. I'm not an entrepreneur while she comes from a family of self employed, I just work my job and that's enough for me. I don't really make big plans for the appartment, she usually does. I know this makes me a bit boring while  she is usually in charge of the fun stuff unless it's meeting up with friends, we organize easily in that matter. On the other hand I'm reliable and there for her when she needs me or my help. I mostly put her first when deciding on my schedule or drop plans if she needs me. Bottom line is that we both have our merits and flaws, I don't want to break her down.\n\nWIBTA for waiting for another month hoping I can trust her again or is that unfair to her or to myself? Should I talk to her about this?\n\nExtra: WIBTA for asking her to let me go through their texts again as this could be an easy way to confirm I can trust her?\n\nSorry for rambling, I'm too close to the situation to think clearly.\n\nTl;dr gf of 7 years has history of emotional attachment with close guy friends, she developed a crush on the last one. Currently on a break because she hid it and I don't know what happened between them (100% no sex though) which is making it hard to start trusting her again.

My company is currently paying for me to get my masters over the next two years. He works for a small business doing admin at a 9-5 job.  I work very long hours.

I wasn't too happy about it, neither was my GF who also lives with me; however I met this guy plenty of times before and even had him over last year for thanksgiving.\n\nAnyways, not long after he moved in my mom didn't want him there anymore.  For no particular reason other then she thought he wasn't looking for a job as hard as he should have been.  He has no license so any job he gets he needs to be able to get to it in a reasonable walking distance.\n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago, my Mom and I come up with a plan that we can pawn him off onto someone else.  My girlfriend is happy because she doesn't want him there (not any safety issues).  So a few days before we pawn him off he gets called in for an interview.  We keep the plan going, then he gets called back for a drug test; we keep the plan going and then a few days after we got rid of him (told him it was just temporary although we planned on it being permanent) they left him a message on my moms answering machine saying he got the job and could start right away.\n\nWe dropped him off 10 miles away in another town, our area doesn't have any real public transportation system.  So now my Mom and I were feeling really guilty that this guy would now have to turn down that job and remain homeless and unemployed because we kicked him out.\n\nMy mom and I agreed we would take him back with the condition that he has 30 days to find a place and move out.  When I told my GF she exploded at me.  In fact its going on day 4 and she wont speak to me, sent me a message today saying shes not going on a trip that we had planned for mid February and that shes sleeping in the guest bedroom until he moves out.\n\nShe feels I chose a homeless man over her and that me and my mother lied to her because we said he wouldn't be coming back and then he got the job so we let him back.\n\nI feel guilty that shes mad at me and that plans changed.  I also would have felt extremely guilty for ruining a mans chances of getting back on his feet.  I can accept some responsibility and know I'm skirted the line of \"assholeish\" just don't know if I went full asshole or not. ",

We were happier, more respectful and more close. But after 4 months, she just started to being close to that guy in the band and everything was crap again. Then she wanted to breaking up with me and we just break up again. After that second separation; she was closer to that guy and that was so disturbing for me. I felt cheated and that is so humiliating. Her friends and his friends was thinking like me, they seemed lovers to everyone. And then i just found that guy and beated him badly. He was in hospital for 2 days. Then she just started to swear to me and humiliate me. And after 3 months of that event; she started to write to me.

In general, this group's communications... are severely lacking. For part 1 of the project I did the vast majority of the work, with the other two only making comments and edits to the document.  \n\n\nPart 2 is now due tomorrow night at midnight. We've had over a month to work on this and had met early in the month to discuss how to get it done, since this isn't something to get done in day or two. However, all three of us are super slammed. For example, I'm in 5 graduate level classes and actively interviewing at a company across the country (read I had a trip in the middle of this) and the other two work full-time and attend full time (3 graduate level classes). So all three of us just kept pushing off this project.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I got back from my job interview trip, I tried to rally the troop's because now we only have 4 days left. One person sends a bunch of potential references (which has been very helpful) and the other has put some notes to consolidate potential ideas. This morning I sent out an e-mail saying effectively, \"Hey guys, we have two days, we have 13-18 pages to write. I've broken it down into sections, here's your sections, let's start getting going on it.\"    \n\n\nI split the work out to me- 60%, person 1- 30%, person 2 -10% based on how my gut tells me they'll actually get done. Since this morning, person 1 did reach out and say \"Ok, but I have another assignment due, so I'll work on it after.\" (Note:  I also have this assignment due and it should only take about 2 hours to complete...) That was now 8 hours ago and there's been no movement on their parts and this person is across the country, so their day is now pretty much shot. Person 2 has not responded since they put the references two days ago.   \n\n\nSo WITBA if I tell let my professor know that at this point, I've done the vast majority of the work for one and from what it seems that I will be the sole author of Part 2?

            "input": "AITA for thinking my boyfriend is shit at art?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend has been pursing a career in art and animation for practically the entirety of our relationship (6+years) and has gotten nowhere. He went to a fancy art school where he worked his ass off for his degree (went to community college first, worked the entire time he was at school, went to food closets, was homeless on and off living out of his car, ect). After we both graduated, we moved in together and I went to get my masters and he went to work in food service. He's been stuck on the idea that he HAS to do animation and hes just waiting for his big break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is. He sucks at it.\n\nHe hasn't even made an animation!\n\nYeah his school sucked so much, they didn't even have students make a demo reel. His story ideas are terrible, his artwork is terrible, and it feels like he's done nothing since graduating. I feel terrible for thinking this way and feel like a total asshole for trying to persuade him to seek another career path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Side:** He won't tell me why he wants to do animation specifically (not even the generic, \"I want to make an impact on the world\" kind of thing) and complains that the world is out to get him (often saying he suffers from \"bad luck\" or \"god hates me\" when I feel like it's his life choices hes making). He complains that the animation industry is cutthroat and works you to the bone and how awful it is. He also complains that art is so hard for him and his hand physically hurts when he even thinks about doing something creative. This all prompts me to say, \"If its so terrible and you complain about it so much.... well then why do you want to do it?\" and he goes on and on about how he wants to create a cartoon series and that he wants to put his degree to use. Or he comes up with a different disingenuous answer every time I ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, he started working part time so that he could work on his art more... but he hasn't really done much. He thought he could open commissions up to make some money on the side... but no one has even messaged him about it and its been months. He has no online following and complains about that too. I'm having to pay for a lot of things because he only makes enough to pay his bills and rent (I buy food, pay for any kind of date, pay for getting his car fixed, pay him for gas to get to work, ect). I honestly don't mind if he was happy but he hates this job too, and it sounds like it's not the right fit. He will not seek another job or pick up more hours because he thinks he is not qualified for anything outside food service and retail (not true), he doesn't want to do any more schooling or training for another career path, and he wants his next job to be an animation job and that's that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is also dead set on moving in with his former roommate that lives in LA (I really dislike him and think hes super sexist and a general man-child) so they can make their own TV show and pitch it to studios. Problem is, I think this friend is just as depressed and hasn't done shit either so I don't know how moving in with him would help. But he claims they have brilliant ideas (that I think are bad) and he needs to be in the same room to \"bounce ideas off each other.\" (Skype is out of the question apparently??)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is stressful for me because he won't say when he is going to move, wont make any plans for it, has no savings for it, and doesn't even know how long he will live out there (six months?? a year??? indefinitely????). I'm trying to find my own way in the world as well and it just feels like his ideas are just outlandish based on his skill. It's making it hard to move forward in life and make plans for the future together. We are close to our thirties now and while we are both the definition of late bloomers, I'm kind of tired of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am by no means a saint. I have had to change my career path and tried many different jobs out. I'm not doing a job that matches my degree. I've volunteered at a lot of different places and come at my career goals in non conventional ways. I've learned a lot from all of these experiences about what I want to do with my life. When he looks at jobs, if they aren't animation he wont even both applying. He's worked food service, retail, and that's it and only because he needed a paycheck. Never had an internship, never volunteered anywhere, nothing. I asked him if he would like to volunteer someplace now he's working part time and he said, \"no that will just take time away that I could be spending drawing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets very angry and stubborn with me if I mention pursuing a different career path, no matter how gently I say it, and it has been the basis for almost all of our fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**His side:** He often feels like I dislike his art and am not supportive of him. He says that these things take time and he is working on artwork and has made lots of progress. He also says he is applying for lots of jobs and he goes to (expensive!) animation conventions to network with people and recruiters for jobs. He spent $500 on an online skype tutoring course with a well known animator and really hit it off with the guy. He thinks that I just really don't get along with his old roommate and wishes that I did because then we could all move in together. LA is the place to be if you want to do animation and no other city would provide him as many opportunities. Me not supporting him is making things worse in his eyes and he wants me to be a supportive partner.  He blames the world around him and says his lack of money makes it hard to do anything. His computer is 4+years old now and makes it hard to even run photoshop on and that's why he doesn't like to animate or do art as much. He also says it takes him a long time to get his creativity flowing and it takes him too long to draw anything. If he just had more talent, he would have a job already (exact wording from him). He gets distracted while drawing and loses track of time (especially in the morning) making it hard to find time in the day to do anything productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe does suffer from depression and has since childhood. I had to push\\* him to go to therapy. He had a lot of negative experiences in the past and was on a crap load of medications that really messed with his affect. Since in therapy he's moved forward a bit, but his therapist is mostly about dealing with his stress and teaching meditation techniques. I also recently pushed him to get medical insurance and see a psychiatrist (and a doctor for the first time since dating). He got diagnosed with ADHD and is somewhat interested in pursuing medication, but is still hesitant because he \"doesn't want to become dependent on a pill.\" and, \"I've made it this far without medication, I don't want to lose the coping mechanisms I've learned to deal with it.\"\n\n\\*By push I mean looking up therapists/medical plans and basically laying it out for him or giving him a script of what to say on the phone when he chooses who to call. As with most things regarding his self care, it's a struggle to get him to do it but once he does he appreciates it and is thankful. I know you can't make anyone get help if they really don't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently looking into doing couples therapy with him.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe has many redeeming qualities (like being a wonderful supportive partner to me) and is such a smart brilliant person with so many skills. He's great at math, science, and all kinds of other subjects! But his determination and constant failure to get into the animation field have been a strain on our relationship. I feel like a huge asshole because instead of being supportive, I want to discourage him! When he draws me things or asks me to look at his latest work, I just feel upset because it's terrible and he won't get a job with his skills the way they are now.  I understand he is going through some heavy depression, but he's just so stubborn. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'd had 1 drink but mixed with my medication, drinks hit me a bit harder than they used to. I wasn't paralytic, but I was definitely not safe to drive.\n\nNow on the estate that I live on, we have a couple of suicidal cats who have a habit of darting through the road. I have told my boyfriend this repeatedly, but he likes to continue going up there at 90mp/h. Last night he wasn't going fast, which is lucky because one of the cats darted across the road. It was still a fair while away, just at the edge of our headlights and he was only going 20. The cat made it across our lane in good time so I thought I'd go ahead and open my mouth to say how I wasn't lying about the cats. Before I could finish the first word, he swerved the car towards the cat in the other lane as a joke.\n\nI was fucking furious.\n\nMaybe the drink had exaggerated my reaction, I will admit that, but as soon as he parked the car I just got out and walked up to my flat with him trailing a ways behind me. I went into the living room and he followed shortly. Now, you'd think I'd be asked if I was ok, or I would get an apology. Nope. I get a \"dude, what the fuck.\" It's at this point I know that it's either get into an argument or change the subject. So I just turned the TV on.\n\nBF: \"Are you actually serious?\"\n\nMe: \"Yep.\"\n\nBF: \"You're actually pissed off about that?\" (so he knew why I was mad)\n\nMe: \"Of course I'm fucking pissed! I'm always telling you about those cats but you still think it's a good idea to swerve into them! Even as a fucking joke, you should have had the sense to not do something so fucking stupid!\"\n\nIn his defense, I did shout first. I didn't start shouting because of what he did though. I started shouting because he knew why, but he didn't care enough to apologise. Had he done that, I would've calmed down. We keep on at the back and forth about how he's a reckless idiot and how I'm crying over nothing, he goes off to eat his food and I start playing some Overwatch and smoking some weed to calm myself down. He comes in afterwards and starts acting cute to try and get my attention and to get me to smile and forget about the whole thing. I was not ready to forgive him yet so I just ignored him and kept playing. Then he starts trash talking my gameplay, which is completely normal in our social circle, so he's still just trying to get me to forget about it. As his attempts continue to fail, he resigns to his fate and slumps next to me. But the things he said next are what really gets my goat. All of this shit is trivial and would've been over and done with in a night.\n\nBF: \"It's like I'm dealing with a fucking six year old.\"\n\nHe has a pattern of doing this shit in our arguments. Shifts the blame onto me and tries to make me feel guilty for being angry. It suddenly clicked when he said that and I started to notice the pattern and why I'm always the one crying at the end. \n\nMe: \"Are you fucking kidding me?! You can't even pretend you're not in the wrong here, you upset me and completely ignored it!\"\n\nBF: \"You have no reason to be upset! It was a joke and you know it! If anyone else had done it, you would have found absolutely hilarious but because it's me, you're pissed off. Cause everyone hates (name) cause it's funny.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh don't even fucking try to pull that shit, I would be pissed off if anyone did that, especially if I was in the car with them!\"\n\nAgain, we had a heated back and forth. This time about how I'm a fucking child and me just unable to comprehend how he can try and villainise me for being upset. It ended with me asking him to leave my flat (we don't live together) but he refused cause it was late and he had work in the morning. I told him sternly that he needs to shut up and leave me alone for the rest of the night or leave. He went to bed and I stayed up all night.\n\nI know it sounds like I've told this story in a very one-sided way, but I promise that there are no details omitted on either side as hard as it might be to believe.

My question is pertaining to something that happened yesterday ( and many more stories like this) while leaving our 2 year old son with her, I had him pick a flower and take it to her. She saw this all happen, and when my son handed her the flower her response was to yell at my husband saying how he should learn from our son and give her flowers all the time.

Sometimes I simply don't know if I am being immature or just don't understand the culture, but I feel she doesn't respect me or my role at all, and expects her son to be more like a husband..than a son to her. :(",

I do this for all students that do not have a car or a ride, man or woman. \n\nThe other night, I offered a student a ride home, which she gratefully accepted. I took her home without incident, but I don’t leave until they’ve gotten in the door, just to be sure they’re safely inside since I’ve taken on the responsibility of getting them home. This night, she did not leave her keys, and could not get inside. They turned out to be states away in her boyfriend’s car (spring break). I let her use my phone, and we went back to campus so she could use my computer to get in touch with her mom and try to figure some stuff out. \n\nTalk of a locksmith and hotels comes up, all I can see is dollar signs,and I was about to offer my spare room of my house. I don’t believe either of us would have perceived it as creepy; I’m a married woman about ten years her senior.

This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.\n\nOne  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn't doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.\n\nSimply put, M comes in every day, and after he's done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.\n\nWith  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, \"Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they'd BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.\"\n\nFrustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I'm sick of M speaking to me like he's my boss, and that he  shouldn't really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn't have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, \"It's not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron's just being helpful so you'll just have to learn  to ignore him.\" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.\n\nWithin this statement,  there's the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don't fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they're meant to slide down.\n\nSo  Long Story short, I think M should be asked not to return to the store.

She’s now gotten to the age of needing additional help in her life. My parents were hesitant at first but decided it was best for for all of us to hire a lady through hospice care. This lady stays with my grandma 24/7. Lastly I want to mention this hospice care is costing my grandma and family A LOT of money. Final piece of background info this is our second care lady because my mom and grandma did not like the first one. \n\nSo my mom has been complaining A LOT lately about not having “family time” anymore. She feels that part of her privacy is gone because there’s always a “stranger” living with us. Yesterday she told her the care lady who smokes cigarettes that she has to smoke off her property. She told the lady that my dad is “allergic to smoke”, he isn’t. \n\nThe day before she told the lady she can no longer eat dinner with us when my mom originally invited her to eat at the table with us the first day she arrived. My mom complains that the lady talks too much at the table and it doesn’t allow every to speak about their day. \n\nSo today my mom was just going on to me about how she doesn’t like someone living with us blah blah blah and I told her to stop. I told her I was sick of hearing her complaining about someone who is trying to make her life easier and my grandma’s final years painless. I ended with telling her, it is what it is and I’m done with any conversation that has to do with my mom complaining about this women. My dad was there when I said it and agreed with me that my mom has been complaining a lot. \n\nSince then, my mom just shut down and hasn’t said anything since. I think what I said was a little too much but I feel like it needed to be said. \n\nTL;DR: Mom has been complaining a lot about a hospice lady who lives with us and I told her to stop complaining and I didn’t want to hear anymore of it. \n\n",

I feel like an ass hole but I also feel like that she’s trying to make me feel that way. \n\nTLDR: after my employee offered to pick up shifts for her coworker with cancer she asked her non manager for 3 days off and avoided her actual manager then the week of vacation told the actual manager she no longer needs time off because the manager took too long to respond.

Usually this would be fine, but for a major extravert seeing people other than family only once a week isn't near enough. All the kids but my oldest brother and sister, (19 and 17), aren't allowed on social media, and can't talk to *anyone* we don't know online, no public discord servers, no chat on games, no Reddit, YouTube, steam forums, et cetera. They also have a rule of no dating until 18.\n\n I eventually just gave up on no game chat because I'm an extrovert and it's painful not being able to talk to people. Making other people happy, telling them jokes, making them laugh, it's what makes me happy. So I started chatting in game. \n\nSo usually I go to bed and read on a Kindle tablet for a bit, but one night it was late and I was too tired to read. I started watching YouTube, and I loved it. I loved interacting in the comments, making jokes, just watching YouTubers. This lead me to discord servers, Reddit, online freinds, and webtoon. Overall, I've been pretty responsible with what I veiw online. There have been multiple times where my parents almost found out, but I just denied it because I'm a compulsive liar and kind of a pussycat when it comes to owning up. \n\nWhat makes this even worse is that I want to become a creator, making animations for YouTube, and illustrating for webtoon, but my parents obviously have a rule against that. I have a messed up sense of self worth, based on how many people know *of* me but don't *know* me. I want to make a difference outside of my friend group you know? Sooo, I've been drawing for a writer I met on webtoon behind their back. \n\nAnother thing about this that upsets me, there's a girl in my class who I think actually likes me, which is a first. (Up until now I haven't really been attractive to say the least, but I look better now.) and I really like her too. But if she ever asks me if I like her, I'll have to turn her down, because my parents wouldn't approve of it.\n\nTo be honest, I actually want my parents to find out at this point, but I can't bring myself to do it. And guys, this post actually isn't for self validation or anything, for the most part it's just to vent because I need to tell *someone.* I know that I'm at least a bit of an A-hole for it.",

Please feel free to skip my rambles to the tl;dr\n\nAbout 5 months ago I (23F) started talking to this guy (25M) I met on tinder, who I’ll call TG (for tinder guy). We hit it off and after a few weeks of hanging out became friends with benefits. This lasted around 4 months before I started to develop feelings. I believe it is important to be honest about these things so I told him how I was feeling right when I realized. I told him he had no obligation to feel the same way, but that I wanted to know where his head was at so I didn’t spend my time pining for a guy just to have my heart broken. To me, getting rejected was a lot easier and simpler when my feelings were still pretty new and not that deep. TG told me that he appreciated my honesty and enjoyed hanging out with me but he saw me as more of a friend than a girlfriend. Getting rejected obviously hurt, but that was the response I was expecting. I told him that I respected that but that I needed some time before we could start being friends and he agreed. Overall, we ended things on pretty good terms.\n\nWith the exception of him sending a few drunk 3 am texts asking for sex (that despite the temptation, I didn’t respond to), we didn’t communicate and we live far enough away that I never had to run into him in public.\n\nDuring the time when we were fwb, TG mentioned that he was looking for jobs in the finance industry and I told him my dad is the VP of a pretty large finance company. (For anyone who thinks he used me to get to my dad: we met randomly on tinder, I have a pretty common last name, and we had already been hooking up for a few weeks when I told him).\n\nAfter about a month after we ended things, I get a text from TG during waking hours asking if I could put in a good word for him with my dad for a job at the company my dad works at. My dad has nothing to do with interviewing/hiring employees, but obviously a recommendation from the company’s VP would be a major advantage. I told TG that I did not feel comfortable doing that. TG then accused me as being vindictive and that I was trying to punish him for not wanting to be my boyfriend. My dad has no idea that TG exists, I have never posted anything with him or about him on social media and I don’t tell my father about the guys I casually hook up with. If I was telling my dad that TG was a terrible person who he shouldn’t hire, then I would 100% understand that I would be the vindictive asshole… but I’m not doing anything like that. TG is in a no better or worse situation from knowing me.\n\nThe part that makes me feel like an asshole is that if TG was my boyfriend, I would ask my dad to recommend him in a heartbeat. So its not like I’m on some moral high ground where jobs should only gotten solely on the basis of merit. Ideally, that would be the case, but I understand in the real world (especially the finance world), who you know matters. TG is a good guy who I know is qualified and I would be happy for him if he got the job, but I just don’t want to ask my dad do to this for him. Does that make me the asshole?\n\n**tl;dr** for not asking my dad to recommend my former fwb for a job.",

Chegg Study is useful for accessing textbook solutions, posting problems to be answered by \"experts\", and searching solutions previously worked by \"experts.\" For college students, it costs $15.00/month. Split among three people, that is $5.00 each per month. We will call my roommates Sally and Betsy.\n\nBetsy is the one who suggested we share a Chegg account. We were all studying one night, and Betsy had a chemistry test the next day. She kept saying how useful Chegg would be for chemistry. I thought it could be useful to me also, since I'm a science student. Betsy suggested the three of us share a Chegg account and pay $5.00 each per month. I knew that by owning the account, I was accepting the risk that my roommates might not hold up their agreement. Nevertheless, I created the account, shared the login information with Betsy and Sally, paid the $15.00 for that month, and sent Venmo requests to Betsy and Sally for $5.00 each. They each paid and we continued to study happily.\n\nThe second month rolled around, and I billed them both for $5.00 after Chegg charged me the $15.00. Sally texted me saying she didn't find it useful but knew it would be useful to me and Betsy. This annoyed me, but I had seen it coming. I decided I would retain the service if Betsy still wanted to share. I didn't bother asking Sally for my $5.00 back because I suspected she would refuse to pay it and throw a fit. Betsy agreed that she and I would retain the Chegg service and pay $7.50 each.\n\nThis month, like every other, I billed Betsy for my $7.50 after Chegg charged my account. She didn't ever pay it. I texted her and asked about it today. She said she wouldn't be using it anymore. I said that was fine, but I still needed the $7.50 because I had already been charged for the month. She was flabbergasted that I had the nerve to ask for my $7.50 that she had effectively spent by not notifying me that she wished to cancel the service. She says she will not pay for something that she isn't using. I explained that this would be like me refusing to pay rent because I decided to move out without giving her notice to find someone else to take over the lease, although the money is not that much. She became irate and insisted repeatedly that she said she \"only needed it for chemistry\" and that she had told me \"MONTHS ago\" that she would not need it after that. In my memory, this is false; she said she would use it for chemistry, not that she wanted to cancel it after the semester ended. And even if she did say that, I think she should have had the courtesy to remind me that she would no longer need the service. We both agreed that we should have had a conversation about whether we intended to continue using it after the semester ended. I told her I wasn't going to fight her over $7.50, but I was frustrated that she had asked me to create the account, then not held up her agreement. She raised the point that I didn't charge Sally for $5.00 when she decided to no longer pay, and I said that it was beside the point because she owed me $7.50 regardless of the $5.00 Sally owes me. I said that at some point, it's my money they're spending by refusing to pay. I feel that if the roles were flipped, she would demand I pay her $7.50.\n\nAITA for asking her to pay me $7.50?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

They’re self centered, self serving, low intelligence, hate speech spewing. “Family\nOver everything” because they heard it in a movie once, garbage people.\n\nAfter 10 longyears I’ve finally made her see the toxicity that these people really are and visits have become scarce. \n\nThey all revolve around “grams house”. And gram has been sick for the last 8 months. Triple-bypass, lungsfilling up with fluid and so on. Gram is obviously dying.\n\nNow Gram for the most part is a good person, she raised the 6 kids that have caused all the toxicity but I’ll let that go. \n\nSo we got a call last night that gram is most likely not going to live thru the next 2 days. My personal opinion is good. Let her die, she’s 95 years old and still babysits 4 kids that these scumbags just dump on her because they don’t wanna be bothered. She’s still paying for her genuinely medically diagnosed lunatic daughter living in the house. And her absolutely vile human being of a son who just mooches. And every time he’s threatened to be thrown out, he just holds onto the “mom won’t let you” card. And he wins. \n\nNow I’m sitting in the hospital waiting room, my wife is in the icu with her grandmother, and she’s found out that her mother and uncle have decided gram should die at home. But they’re not telling anyone. \n\nMind you the 29 year old grandson who’s given up his whole life to take care of his grandmother lives there as well.

But if she dies in the house he’ll have to disclose it to every potential buyer (we live in a state with that law), have to clean up the mess, and have to deal with his crazy mother losing her shit because she saw her mother dead. \n\nBut thru all this, I just don’t give a fuck. I’m here for my wife because she needs support, but\nEven that is hard to muster sometimes. Most of\nThe support she needs is to deal with her scum bag family.

Same thing again. She comes to my room at night and says \"zsnes I'm not feeling too good my blood pressure is super high can you get me to the ER?\" \"Are you sure? Wait till tomorrow you have your appointment anyway with our own doctor\". She got kinda irritated and angrily told me it's fine,she'll ride the car herself. \"People get paralyzed from stuff like that you know\" she said.\n\nI just sighed and asked why she has to be like that. Anyway I still get up and reluctantly prepare to drive her (admittedly I was  annoyed and didn't hide it but I kept my mouth shut afterwards.\n\nSo we get to the hospital at like 1AM. After half an hour my mom comes out and asks me for her bag. She brought her own blood pressure machine with her and apparently needed it. I give it to her and follow her to the doctors room. The doctor tells me her blood levels are normal, no abnormalities. \n\nMy mom was kinda confused at this point and tried showing the doctor that her own machine showed a much higher and more dangerous value. \n\nTurns out the unit on my mom's device was a total different one than the regular ones, so she read the numbers totally wrong and assumed they were worse.\nDr. just told us to get a new machine and call a non emergency hotline first next time.\n\nSo we leave and my mom seems a little embarrassed, because she starts trying to explain how it was before and she did in fact feel bad. I tell her it's okay since I only want to get back to my bed at this point. \n\nAt home I want to remind her to make sure she differentiates between serious emergencies and regular \"I'm sick and not feeling good\" occasions. Because I do love my mom more than anything and I get worried just like this time. But because it happens more often I'm scared that I won't take her seriously if something worse might happen another time. Also to not burden hospital staff.\n\nShe got really upset and explained she did feel bad. I only told her she could have waited until the next morning, since there is a safe appointment anyway. In her mind that sounded like I was apparently only annoyed because I had to drive her (which isn't my issue) so she starts telling me I'm ungrateful and all the things she does for me get unnoticed.

She's 18 and I'm 20, this weekend we are home with the two of us and she decided to throw a party yesterday.\n\nI went out to a buddy of mine for a smoke sesh and came back around 11 P.M. M was having a girls night and she invited 5 people. I have seen all her friends a few times and I would consider myself to be good friends with M. I greeted everyone and went to my room as to not disturb them further. Was feeling pretty good already but decided to roll myself a blunt and took my bong out for a few bowls throughout the night. \n\nAround 12 the munchies kicked in and I went downstairs to grab some snacks. They saw me in the kitchen and it was obvious they were already pretty drunk. I got dared to take 4 shots back to back and they started teasing me and calling me a pussy for not doing it. Now I was already pretty high but decided to to do it because why not. M asked me if I had some green and I gave them my bong and took a few hits with them. Left the bong downstairs for them to use and went up with my snacks and rolled another blunt. \n\nI was just puffing and watching YouTube in my bed when someone opened my door. It was M and her friend S. They were laughing their asses off and they both jumped on my bed. I was roughly a [9] at this point and was not sure what to do. I asked them how they were doing and all they did was giggle, touch and tease me. They were both in lingerie too. Somebody called M and she left my room but S was still laying down on my bed. Usually she's pretty shy but a real sweetheart nonetheless. That was not the case now and she was barraging me with questions and kept eying me. \n\nLong story short, we shared the blunt I had left and went to watch some Netflix. This eventually escalated and we ended up having sex and falling asleep afterwards. I don't even know if we used protection.\n\nThis morning I was woken up by M who angrily told me to 'wake the fuck up'. She told me she couldn't believe I had slept with her friend and called me disgusting. I tried to apologize but she was having none of it and stormed out of my room. She hasn't talked to me since and acts like I don't exist. I have a bunch of messages from S thanking me for the night and that she loved it but she had to tell M and that she's sorry.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

I've stated to him multiple times that I need to fight my own battles otherwise I never will and he agreed entirely with me, but since then he still acts like he's coming to my rescue whenever I need to stand up for myself. I just recently got a ticket for unreasonable speed with poor weather conditions (wrecked my car) and I had asked him for some advice and if he could come just so I know what I'm doing. It came time for me to go up and talk to the judge and DA to see if I couldn't get the ticket dismissed or bumped down so it wouldn't affect my time with enlisting. He asked if I wanted him to come up with me and I said yes, but let me do the talking I want you there as support (because yes he is very much who I look to if I get nervous or stumble) he agreed he wouldn't say anything. So the judge asked me if I wanted any documents explaining what unreasonable speed is due to it being a vague area. I was about to say no when my father starting viciously shaking his head yes, so I said yes. The judge said it may take up to 30 days for them to get some documentation from the State Trooper explaining, he asked me if there was a date I would prefer to come in on and just before I was about to explain my situation and that I didn't need the document I just need the whole court process over with so I could continue with the recruitment process my dad just started talking and explaining everything and said we could talk to the DA to lower the ticket. My dad then proceeded to not even let me talk to the DA and instead took complete control of the situation for me.\n\nAfter we had left the court room I confronted him saying that was exactly what I didn't want him to do.

We live about 7 hours away from one another, and will not see each other for about a month, which is okay; she adores her family and I don't want to intrude on her Christmas holiday. The issue here is that I do not adore my family, and I find living with them burdensome and stressful.\n\nFor context, my Mother has dementia, but has always been stubborn and narcissistic, and whilst my Father adores her he has no clue how to handle her, and she emotionally abuses him to tears. My Father himself does not know how to handle my Mother, and often gets angry and starts to shout at her. I haven't seen them in about 3 months and they've both gotten worse, meaning that living here over Christmas was a massive shock to me.\n\nAs a result of this, I have spent the majority of my holiday either in my room all day, or ouside the house. My girlfriend knows this. If she asks me how my day has been, I answer honestly, and say that today has been boring / tough / upsetting, and of she asks I elaborate on whatever arguement happened that day. \n\nI think because of this we end up texting way more than we should be, we run out of things to talk about. Furthermore, as we are texting than talking face to face, we can't convey exactly what we feel when we say something, meaning I think she is under the impression that I am constantly upset while i'm here, then that is only really confined to when I'm having to deal with my parents.\n\nLast night, my thoughts are verified. She is upset that I've spent my day in my room, saying \"Just so you know, in this house spending time just in your room isnt something people do much\". I reply with \"Yeah, and in this house, enjoying time with other people isnt something you do much\". From here, we both take a moment and then say that we have stuff to think about. We no we're both upset, I feel I was rude and thoughtless in what I said. I reply later on, apologising for the comment, that it were unnecessary.\n\nShe replies afterwards- she says that that's not why she is upset. She is upset that she hasn't enjoyed this holiday like she normally would, and its because she knows that I'm not enjoying my holiday. She hates the thought that she dislikes me telling her about my problems, and she says that what she feels is callous, and mean, and she says she is sorry for it. I understand, since coming home the amount of times I needed to talk to her because I was upset was almost daily.\n\nShe goes quiet for about half an hour before returning. She's argued with her mum, which is rare. She is extremely upset, and feels she can't talk it to me because she feels she has let me down. She says that she's thought about it, and she needs some time to think, and that she would not message me for a while.\nI want to be there for her, if she has argued with her mum. Their arguement eclipses ours in importance. Yet, she obviously doesn't want to talk to me right now, she needs someone else, like her best friend.\n\nI'm conflicted on what to do regarding the rest of this holiday and the relationship as a whole. I feel like I have been a completely different person over the holiday, and she's been made fully aware of that fact because we message for hours on end. I know that this current issue will be swiftly resolved when I go back to university on January 5th, and meet her (and her family, for the first time) on January 12th. Nevertheless, I know what we have both handled this horribly, and I don't know how to approach the subject of my family with her from now on.\n\nShould I have to tread carefully about the topics I talk about when I'm in a relationship, when we've already agreed to speak our mind and say when we're upset? Am I the asshole for putting this pressure on her over her holiday, when I know what she is with her family? Are there any red flags here things I need to think about or watch out for? How could we approach talking about things we're struggling with without putting pressure on one another?\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile)",

I tried bringing this up several more times until I finally started raising my voice and telling him to make up his mind and asking him if he could hear me. He seemed to ignore everything I said and kept trying to drum up more conversation. It ended up with me telling him to get out 45 minutes later (around 5;45 am) and (semi)forcibly escorting him to the door. He's usually a really good guy and I like hanging out with him, but I'm embarrassed to talk to him now. Am I the asshole for kicking him out?",

So I had been friends with this girl “Sandra” for three years and we by absolute chance ended up attending the same college and summer program together. She met this guy in our program, “Hank,” who was honestly a total jerk. She originally had liked this other guy and was starting to see him but Hank won her over for a bit. \n\nSandra and I had been hanging out for awhile when Hank started to get jealous and wanted to come hang out too, so obviously there was no problem with it and he came over. He then decided that he wanted to make some food, Sandra and I agreed, but we would have to go to CVS to get some ingredients (CVS because it was the only place in walking distance and none of us had cars). \n\nSo we get to CVS, get our stuff, and we are at the checkout line. A nice woman is the cashier, whom Sandra and I had a few days prior and gotten friendly with, and there was an older woman behind us in line. Hank gives Sandra a little grief over money and then pretends to shove her. The cashier gave us a wide eye look so Hank backtracked immediately and said, “Nah don’t worry, I’m abusive and all but Sandra loves me.” The cashier was *not* cool with that and told him how it was not okay to joke about that and that she was a survivor of abuse. (I also knew that Sandra had gone through abuse previously and knew she was uncomfortable with the “joke”). Anyways, we all leave with him refusing to apologize. \n\nWe are in the parking lot, about to walk back to our dorms, and I just do not feel right about leaving. I told Sandra and Hank we should go back in and apologize and they both said we shouldn’t. They then proceeded to wonder if we should go to this convenience store on the way back, so as they’re discussing this I say that I’m going back into CVS to get a drink. \n\nI go back inside and see that the cashier is checking out the woman who was behind us, I awkwardly walk up to her (the cashier) and just say I’m sorry for my friends’ actions and that I do not agree with them and wish I had stood up in front of them in the moment. \n\nThe cashier said she understood and thanked me and the older woman started crying and said how it was “fucked up” what Hank said and how she was also a survivor of abuse and how she was so upset and angry when she heard him joking about it. I apologized again and she said I had nothing to be sorry about but thanked me. I felt awful for not stopping Hank in the moment. \n\nI said goodbye to them and went outside to Hank and Sandra, who were like “what took you so long? Where’s your drink?” So I told them the truth and said I apologized for Hank’s statements. Hank got really quiet and angry and Sandra said I should not have done that because Hank felt bad enough already. She also said now she feels an obligation to go apologize. \n\nWas I the A in this situation? Should I not have gone back in?",

I tailgated a car for some time, honked at it, and blew past it, inadvertently cutting him off and forcing him to brake.

He spat on me, screamed a series of **extremely** vile racial slurs, death threats (including graphic references to lynching/hanging) and obscenities at me and **my two small daughters** for a full 2 minutes (impeding traffic for some of this time). He screamed **so** unbelievably loud, got freakishly red, the veins started popping out of his head; I was honestly expecting him to have a stroke or burst a vessel. But worst of all, my kids and I feared he might hurt or even kill us.\n\nThe incident terrified me, but scarred my daughters. They cried and cried, had nightmares about the encounter for a long time afterwards, and I had to have some very long discussions with them that I really wished I would not have to have until they were much, much older. The incident sickened and enraged me like nothing I have ever experienced. I just so happened to catch it all on my dashcam; I turned the cam towards him the moment he started in (as evidence if he were to assault me), and saved the footage on my computer just in case I ever had another run in and needed evidence.\n\nCut to two years later. I’m at an upscale brewery/restaurant with some buddies, look over at the bar area, and who do I see behind the counter, dressed in a nice suit and managing the bar? **The raging driver.** Still bitter, I made eye contact with him, and he froze like a statue and went white with shock when he saw &amp; recognized me. Throughout that dinner, I continued to torment him with a series of sly little grins. When I left to take a bathroom break, he approached me.\n\nHe apologized to me profusely. He claimed he’s severely bipolar and that that was one of his manic outbreaks; he assured me he is not in any way racist or violent, and that if he could do anything to take back his words, he would. He claims to have since gotten his life together; having gone to therapy, gotten medicated, ended his drug abuse habits, etc, and promises me that he is a very changed man. I responded by telling him I still have that video of him raging, can destroy his life and career with a single click, and promptly walked away.\n\nI’m very seriously considering sending the video to his manager, AND even posting the video publicly on social media. Now I know the guy’s name and more info about him, and that he works (and might live) in my close vicinity, I realize it could really make a splash.

My dog is a little annoying when he barks/howls (beagle) but only does it when he's playing, it is sometimes ear piercing, but when he gets too wild I pull him aside and give him a little \"timeout\" because I know it can get annoying for other dog owners, but they say it isn't that bad.\n\nWhen I do have my dog on a leash, he wears a harness, this apparently was an open invitation to said neighbor to pick him up by the harness. The first time I didn't say anything, the second time I told him not to do that, and the third time he did it is when I lost my patience. Now to describe this guy, he's on the Board at my HOA. He's a little arrogant, he always has to be right, always trashing on neighbors and dishing their issues, stuff like that. He's a little older than the average age of people who let their dogs play, we're in our late 20s-mid thirties, this guy is in his 50s. We don't hate him but more or less we tolerate him.\n\nWell during this situation, there was about 5 of us out there with our dogs, my dog was howling and I tried to calm him down a bit, once I let him go the Board member picked him up off the ground by harness and yelled at him and called him a little shit. I walked over, grabbed my dog, and told him to never touch my dog again. I got in his face and asked what the fuck his problem was. I never shoved/touched him, but I let it be known I do not appreciate my dog being treated like that, I will discipline my own dog. I would never treat anyone else's dog like that unless he was attacking another dog or another person (which my dog never would, any sign of aggression from another dog he just rolls over on his back wagging his tail).\n\nBM tries to play off the situation as he was \"just playing around\" and I told him no one else here would ever do that to my dog, and I would never do that to theirs. He tried to make me out like I was the asshole, like I'm the dick for getting mad at him for doing that even after I told him not to. He consistently disrespects others and thinks he's untouchable because he knows people don't want to start shit with board members. I don't know if he's that arrogant and just doesn't give a fuck, or actually that disconnected from reality where he can do whatever he wants without repercussions. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry and pissed off at him?

My sister (when her boyfriend just moved in with her before mine moved in) remarked that we would be a perfect couple because we're both skinny (she is heavily overweight) . I started being cold towards him. When my boyfriend moved in I had issues with her walking in the room in front of my boyfriend in just her underwear and too small shirts that showed her well endowedness. I mentioned this to her boyfriend as I have a severe anxiety problem along with other issues and have trouble confronting people. He said he would deal with it she continued to do the same behavior claiming that \"she didn't care because she loved her body and what we thought didn't matter to her\" I'm speechless at this point. She hardly does anything around the house just sleeps all day and then will wash a dish or so and say she did the dishes or say she cleaned the room I did to our father telling him I sleep all day even though people living here vouch for me. She once bought a bottle of wine for thanksgiving with her boyfriends money and then was upset it was smaller than she remembered and then try to tell my dad I drank her whole bottle of wine and replaced it with a smaller bottle. (mind you I can't buy I'm underage for alcohol and me and my boyfriend did not have a penny to our name at this point in time) she has also taken several of mine and my boyfriends shirts or hoodies and worn them stretching them out  swearing they're hers or her boyfriends, I typically get two sizes up (I fit into a size s) because of reasons and my mother and family know this my mom bought me an extremely cute outfit in light colors to help \"boost my mood\" the shirt was a xxxl, my sister constantly grabs the shirt and says it must be hers because it's her size, we will have that argument every time she sees the shirt. Theres more but this is ridiculously long; My sisters boyfriend has a dog, I have a work in progress to potty train puppy, the family has two dogs. My dog was locked in the kitchen with me as I was cooking, my brother went in my room to find their dog in my room ears down and poop in my room bigger than my dogs and smaller than the families dogs. My boyfriend politely asked her to clean it up, She starts yelling at him, im in the kitchen with a sharp knife and I happen to have a sensory issue so loud noises and stuff can cause issues I ask for them to tone it down, they get louder at this point I proceed to almost cut my finger so I match in there mad and find out what's going on, I ask her to clean up the mess since we clean up our dogs mess and have cleaned up hers enough, she starts called me a bitch and a bunch of other stuff I go off since I'm back in the kitchen giving it right back to her my boyfriend and brother get scared she's gonna come hit me so they go wake up the boyfriend. It's kinda fuzzy from there but the boyfriend came down later and said aggressively \"don't worry we'll be gone by the first\" \n\n\n\nTL:DR- sister has no respect for boundaries and is so painfully lazy she almost got violent to get out of cleaning dog shit, and I want to cut her off even though my father does not; Am I the asshole?",

I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me “so are we using what you did then?” Taken aback I said “well no we’ll use a combination, what info have you found?” And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn’t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn’t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet.

So I just said “Hey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?” at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn’t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn’t found anything because I’d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It’s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn’t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn’t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*",

We have weekly chores that we are all assigned, and the general rule is to wash your dishes within the day you use them. \n\nOn Tuesday, we noticed one housemate (let's call them Housemate A) had not done their dishes in a while. They were starting to pile up and they hadn't been washed out (there was food stuck to them). I had seen an ant in the apartment earlier so I sent a message to the group chat, asking everyone to remember to do their dishes within 1-2 days to avoid bugs. Housemate A responded, saying they could probably not do the stack of dishes until the weekend. They said they were busy since they had 4 midterms, and had no time. I was a little peeved but I told them that I understood they were busy.   \nFast forward to Thursday night, and the dishes were still not done. There was a dead fly in one of the cups, the plates and bowls were not rinsed out, and they were starting to smell. It was so gross. One of the housemates and I started complaining to each other in the kitchen, just saying that we were grossed out, and it was incredibly annoying that Housemate A had left them this long, *especially when we have a dishwasher*. Said nothing bad about them as a person, but we expressed our general annoyance and exasperation with the situation. \n\nThe next morning, we wake up to see that the housemate has posted a long rant on their Snapchat about people they trusted talking behind her back, talking shit, etc. We realized that they probably heard us discussing the dish situation the previous night before. They posted all these quotes about how people are quick to criticize but never congratulate them on their accomplishments -- just generally really passive-aggressive stuff. I feel bad for complaining to my other housemate, but I also don't think they should have left their dishes that long when we have a dishwasher. It's been three days and they have yet to say a word to me or the other housemate; it's pretty obvious they are ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. Were we assholes for talking behind their back? I don't want to lose our friendship over this, but I also think they are slightly overreacting. ",

            "input": "So first, some backstory.\n\nDuring my sophomore year in high school I met this girl (who we'll call Sarah) and we hit it off quite well. We developed feelings for each other and we kept on talking until the last day of summer break when she told me she didn't like me anymore. I was heartbroken for months, but then I met this other girl (who we'll call Anna) who helped me out of that dark place, and I then realized I started to have feelings for her and as it turns out they were mutual but she was not allowed to date so we just kept it on the down low for about a year, but I found she was a bit emotionally unavailable, so I explained that I craved more affection and emotion and broke up with her basically. So at this point we are in Senior year and not long after that one of me and Anna's mutual friends (who we'll call Sally) said that she liked me, and I saw that as a means of getting the things I craved so I decided I was down but she changed her mind at the last minute and we never became a thing. So Anna found out about that and was even more hurt than she already was (she had been having breakdowns in the middle of class and stuff like that according to yet another friend who is not important to the rest of the story, to which I replied \"where was that emotion when I needed it?\", but I digress) because it was as if I had never cared about her in the first place which really wasn't the case. I felt so bad and I really wanted to repair our relationship, but then Sarah comes back and explains that the reason she had told me she no longer liked me was just because past relationship trauma from her middle school years made her go into panic mode and she did not want to leave herself vulnerable again, but her feelings for me never truly went away, and what made her come back was that she actually tried being with a different guy but the guy ended up getting back with his ex without even telling Sarah about it so Sarah, now knowing how I felt originally, went back to me to apologize and wanted to try us again but for real this time. We wanted to wait until the whole thing with Anna and Sally blew over before we became official, but they ended up finding out because Sally was actually Sarah's best friend and I was texting Sarah but Sally had her phone at the time taking pictures for snapchat. So Anna is even more upset at me now and so is Sally because now it's like I never cared about either of them. I feel absolutely horrible that I caused all of this, I really never intended for any of this to turn out the way it did. I used to look at guys who were players in disgust but now I am just disgusted at myself that I became one of them. Sarah and I just decided to become official since there's really nothing to lose now but I am still trying to forgive myself. I was being so stupid. This series of events (which I'll call The Crisis to refer to it later) was my first real experience with relationship drama and I'm trying to take as many lessons from it as possible, better I learn now than later right? But anyways, now for the actual story. \n\nSo I was texting Sarah and she told me that one of our mutual friends (who we'll call Chris) had been mean to her after Anna and Sally interrupted a conversation she was having with a mutual friend of me, Sarah, Anna, and Sally (who we'll call Aaron). Sarah had a theory that Sally was trying to steal away their mutual friends from before The Crisis, which would explain the interruption but the facts are unclear. It is no secret that Chris liked Anna so it would make sense if Chris was simply putting on a show for Anna so I decided to confront Chris even though Sarah said it was okay. I texted him saying \"Were you mean to Sarah to put a show on for Anna?\" and he explained that he didn't mean to make Sarah feel bad, he thought that was just their banter because they were being jokingly mean to each other just that morning. I was satisfied, I just wanted to know what happened after all, and that was supposed to be the end of it but turns out Chris had screenshotted the conversation and I assume showed it to Anna, making fun of me for thinking his act was a show for her. Anna probably told Sally about it because Sally somehow found out and texted me saying that she did not even talk to Aaron to begin with and that I should keep her name out of my mouth. She was acting like I was spreading rumors or something but I literally only spoke to Chris who was involved anyway. But what confused me is that she claimed she didn't talk to Aaron so I asked Chris about it since he saw the whole thing and he confirmed that Sarah was talking to Aaron when Anna and Sally came and interrupted the conversation. I asked him for permission to use that as proof and when he said yes I screenshotted what he said and showed it to Sally to which she replied that all she did was call Aaron's name and then Aaron started talking to Anna. I was pretty sure that still counts as interrupting the conversation but I thought this whole situation was extremely petty so I just let her have the last word and let that be the end of it. I then told Sarah what had happened and she got so upset with me. She kept saying that I should've dropped it when she said it was okay and that it was none of my business. She didn't talk to me for like a day after that and in the meantime I was talking to Chris about the whole situation and we both agreed that neither of us had the intention of escalating the situation to this height. When Sarah finally did explain why she got so upset, she explained that she did not want Sally to hate her any more than she already did, she did not want to poke the bear so to speak. As I previously explained they were best friends before The Crisis, and I guess she still wanted to find a way to remain that way but that confuses me because she knew that trying to be with me in the first place would mean losing her, so I assumed she was prepared for that and thought I was worth it. I explained to her that I don't think she can have the both of us at the same time and that I don't want her to go on a wild goose chase for Sally. I just think this whole situation was extremely petty and honestly should not have even happened. \n\nThis is a long one so thanks if you read the whole thing, but without further ado: AITA?",

I live in the same dormitory as A, B, and C.  At the beginning of the school year, A and B got into a really heated conflict/argument, and it ended up becoming pretty personal, with A getting so mad as to yell at B that she was a \"disgusting person,\" and the 2 have been avoiding each other ever since.  I personally did not see what the conflict was about, and although the 2 kept avoiding each other, I would still regularly hang out with both of them individually and try to avoid talking about it with either group.  Ultimately, C, D, and E all took to the side of B (some of them had witnessed the conflict and some of them had not), and I decided that I could not fairly judge who to take sides with so I decided to remained neutral.\n\nFlash forward to a few days ago, and I have been hanging out with A fairly often, and A really only hangs out with me.  I am still friends with B, C, D, and E, and we still regularly hang out and go out together, but I spend a lot more of my free time with A.  One night, after me and A came back from a party and were both fairly drunk, we ran into B, C, D, and E.  A stayed fairly quiet when we saw them while I started to make conversation with them.  As I was wrapping up the conversation and about to leave, A loudly made several rude remarks to B and walked off.  Later that night I heard B, C, D, and E talking in B's room about how shitty of a person A is.  They kept calling him names and attacking his character, while also mentioning that I have shitty taste in friends and that they don't understand how I keep hanging out with A.  I did feel bad about this, as I know A much better than they do, and although A can come off as a bit arrogant and brash (he was featured on a pretty highly up voted post on r/iamverysmart), A has opened up a lot to me about some shit that he's gone through and I don't think it's fair to just call him a shitty person like they were.\n\nA ends up coming into my room, mad that they are talking shit about him, and proceeds to rant about them to me, attacking the character of not only B, but C, D, and E as well.  A then complains that, in this conflict he has no one on his side, and that I should stand up for him and defend him because we are supposed to be friends.  He acknowledges that I didn't want to take sides in this conflict, as I never join in while they talk shit about him, and as I always try to avoid talking about it- but A argued that I should be more assertive and defensive of his character to my other friends when they start talking about him.  I continued to refuse to take either side, and said that he should respect my wishes to stay out of it, especially since I have to see B and C all the time.  He then accused me of only liking him because he has connections to fraternities around campus and could thus get me into parties.  At this point, I was pretty fed up with him for saying that and I just told him to leave my room if he thinks that little of our friendship.\n\nAfter some reflection, I feel like I definitely could have handled the situation better, and at least made a promise to A to defend his character if I were ever around while they are talking shit about A.  I have reasoned that doing this isn't necessarily me taking a side, as long as I start to defend B's character whenever A talks shit.  Maybe I should start being a better friend in general.\n\nAm I the Asshole for not defending A?",

I had this friend in high school that I would constantly go to parties with and play video games with and we had a similar sense of humour but I really didn't like him for a number of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would always need money. He would want me to buy him food, he would need me to buy him cigarettes (I hate smoking so this really pissed me off) and he would also want me to give him money so he could buy weed. It got to the point where he owed me at least 200 dollars. Remember, this is high school, money is scarce and every amount of it I had, my parents are asking what I did with it. It pissed me off that I would be decent enough to give him some of the money my parents would allow me to have to spend on things I wanted and he would never pay me back and joke about how he never would like it wasn't a serious issue for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would take advantages of privileges my parents would afford me and ruin them. An example is that my dad would let me use his car every so often but it cam under the condition that I treat the car with respect and this friend would constantly insist on smoking cigarettes in the car and would light up without asking first. I got in trouble multiple times because of this and had car privileges revoked. He would also say we should just smoke weed in the car and then drive back to one of our places like driving under the influence wasn't a big deal. What if a bunch of intoxicated 16-17 year olds get pulled over by the police while high out of our minds. My license would get taken away and he didn't seem to care. Just do it! Whats the big deal??? And he would act like I was being a bitch about these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He wanted to smoke weed every day. I am someone who has a bit of an addiction problem with weed. If I smoke it every day, my grades tank, I start putting on serious amounts of fat, and generally become a less functioning person but he insists on smoking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically what I did was continue the friendship until graduation and then when I didn't need to see him again, I cut all contact and never spoke to him again. He would continue texting me for a few weeks after that wondering what was going on but I didn't respond. I just ghosted him hard and I feel bad about it sometimes. But I've barely smoked week since and lost 40 pounds and put on a bit of muscle. My grades in University were actually similar to those in high school which is unheard of. I'm just a better person and many of the goals in my life couldn't be achieved while catering to the type of lifestyle he insisted on if we were to continue hanging out. I don't really have any friends from high school though because they decided to stick with him rather than me. My relationships with my parents has improved drastically though and I've made better friends since. Maybe I should have handled breaking off the friendship differently. I don't know. I do know that he was not good for me. Am I the ass hole?",

Summary at the end.\n\nSome background, I have pretty severe anxiety and a history of doing more than my fair share of group projects since I worry about them not getting done otherwise.\n\nI'm currently at Uni and working on a project  with three other students. I should start by mentioning that this project is divided in 2 parts, one group-assignment/report and one individual report. \n\nAs per usual my anxiety is acting up and I estimate that I've done about 70% of the group-assignment so far. Despite this I have no problems with two of the three members of my group, they always show up and do their best. The work so far is based on our discussions and ideas so they still do work.\nBut this third student... \n\nShe skipped the first couple of lessons were we laid down the rules in the group (respect,being on time, critique is welcome but not negativity, etc.) Which means that she wanted us all to write separately in a shared document even though the rest of us already agreed that we'd work better together, continuously developing our ideas.\n\nIn our almost 17 page long shared document she has written less than a page and only because we told her what to type.\n\nShe missed an important meeting were we ended up making some major changes, however I summarised the whole thing and put it in the aforementioned document for her to read - she didn't. \n\nShe skipped out on both a seminar and a work shop aimed at getting dead back from other groups so we can make changes before the presentation. SO THAT SHE COULD WORK ON HER OWN ASSIGNMENT.\nShe also doesn't want to meet up this week to fix the changes even though the presentation is only a week away (again - anxiety).\n\nSo today I finally did it. I sent my teacher an email and abandoned the group. I will be doing my own report on the project (Which I came up with by the way).\nI even left them with the document and all the work I've done so far.\n\nNow here's the kicker: she told ME that I was being unfair for calling her out on not doing any work and now she's pissed at me. She thought I was being rude for assuming she didn't do any work because she spent that time \"on her individual report\".\n\nI feel sorry for the other girls but as mentioned that still have access to all my work and notes leading up to this point.\n\nHelp me see this from her POV.\nAm I the asshole?\n\nSummary: I do 70% of a group project while another girl skips meetings to work on her own assignments so I leave the group with a week left to deadline.",

            "input": "Now to start off, let me say that this isn't a post to get validation, I seriously want to know if I'm being an asshole, or at least, anything less than OK. It's also important to note that nobody has ever called me an asshole over this, it's just something that I myself am worried about.\n\nAnyway, I'm in love with my best (female) friend. I myself am male. During this story, which is still going on right now, we're around ages 16-20.\n\nI became friends with her because I had a crush on her. As soon as I felt it was socially appropriate, which was about 4-5 months into our friendship, I told her that. She said OK, but has basically dodged saying anything about reciprocation. Now, I'm not a dumbass, I know that \"not saying yes\" means \"no\". So I don't make any illusions of her being in love with me. She's basically trying to not hurt my feelings.\n\nHowever, despite this, I'm still in love with her. I don't have any issue with her avoiding the question, and I know that she, currently, isn't interested in a relationship (With anyone). Knowing this, I try to avoid bringing it up to much and try to just stay mostly friends. But I can't get rid of my love for her. I've told her this as well, or at least, I think it was clear from what I've said.\n\nThe big problem is that my wishes for the friendship and hers obviously don't align perfectly. I'd like to have way more contact with her than the other way around. Now, we've devised a situation that mostly works. We meet up at least once a year, possibly more if she wants. I email her every month. And she's 'required' to send me 2 emails per year. Now, when I say emails, these are big emails, usually being 1-3 pages, but I've sent one that was 8,25 pages long. A bit excessive, I know. Plus sometimes, there's some extra contact, like wishing each other a happy birthday, happy new year, all that jazz. \n\nAll in all, I'd say, on average, we meet up around 2 times a year and she emails me a couple of times a year, while I email her every month. This along with little titbits of contact along the way. She has assured me that this isn't something specific to me, and that this is just how she works. This has fluctuated along the years, but so far, the friendship has survived, even despite some (possibly major) issues. I'd obviously like more contact, but I try to respect her wishes.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not always the best at respecting her wishes and boundaries. Often times I get too excited or too depressed and start messaging her a bit too often. For example, while I can keep myself to 1 email per month the majority of the times, I'd say that in 1/3rd of all months, there would be another email. Sometimes, these weren't too big, like responding back to her when she responded, however, I don't think these emails were a real problem. The real problem emails were the ones I sent out of depression, loneliness, or whatever.\n\nI try to restrain myself from sending those emails, and in later times (As in, the last few months), I've been able to do so (Because I currently don't have anything that would lead to me sending those emails). However, previously, I haven't been so lucky. I went almost a whole year sending her 2 emails instead of 1, where I basically split up the month in 2 segments. Now, after she told me that she didn't like it, because it became too much for her, I stopped immediately. But I still did it for the previous few months, and that's something that I can't take back.\n\nThe even bigger problem however, weren't those emails. They weren't the emails I sent out of depression or other things. The emails I did send out of depression were pretty fucking bad. I'd try to always assure her that it wasn't her fault and that I'm merely venting to her about shit, but it basically became a negative feedback loop for myself. As I've said, currently, I've stopped doing so, and don't plan on doing it again, although I don't know if I'll be able to restrain myself from doing so when the going gets tough again.\n\nAnd currently, we've worked out most of these issues and our friendship still stands. We're prepared to face any new issues that might come our way, and the future looks bright. But my question is, was I an asshole for doing that to her in the past, or was it just a series of unfortunate events?",

One of them, who we'll call Walter, is my uncle and he's an alcoholic who frequently verbally abuses his wife in front of his 4 kids. So yeah, total idiot, and I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to spend as little time as possible interacting with him in any way.\n\nSo now that that's out of the way, onto the story.\n\nToday is my 20th birthday, and so my grandfather wanted to go on a trip to celebrate it. I was naturally really excited to go, and he never said anything that would imply that it would be anyone but just me, my brother, and two of our younger siblings. I also never had any reason to believe that it would be anyone but us, because he rented out a 3 bedroom house for us to stay in over the duration.\n\nBut as soon as we got there, there was already another car parked in the driveway, which was Walter's family car. I was a little annoyed, but I was assuming that they would be renting the house next to ours since we would definitely not have enough room in the one we're currently renting. But no, they actually are staying in the three bedroom house that we're renting.\n\nFor perspective, I had assumed that there would be 5 people staying with us; me, my brother, two younger siblings, and my grandfather, which would fit the 3 bedrooms quite nicely, since two bedrooms had twin beds in them, for a total of 5 beds. Now there's fucking 10 people in this house in total. When I asked my grandfather why he thought it would be a good idea to invite a whole entire other part of the family to come stay with us in a 3 bedroom house for 4 days, all he said was \"I'm sorry you're disappointed.\"\n\nSo now me and my brother are considering just buying an uber and hitching a 4 hour ride back home, for several reasons:\n\n1. I don't feel like dealing with screaming children for 4 days straight. I don't dislike kids, I just hate to listen to them when they're loud and their parents have no control over them whatsoever, and they have 3 toddlers, with no control over them whatsoever.\n\n2. I'm honestly kind of pissed that he would invite them when he knows for a fact that I don't like them, especially on something like a trip for my birthday that we've been planning for over a month now. And he didn't even tell me they were coming.\n\n3. It's fucking cramped. We're having to cram 10 people into 3 bedrooms. It just doesn't work.\n\nSo, the reason I'm making this post is because I definitely would feel bad about just walking out on a trip that my grandfather wanted to give me for my birthday, but I definitely don't feel bad about walking out when I'm sharing a house with a toxic couple and their obnoxious children.

            "input": "Throwaway because I'm curious and don't know if the couple uses reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the backstory: I own my home and in order to help with costs and savings I rent out the rooms in my home. I won't get too into details about this but recently I have been struggling financially for external reasons so having room mates has become a must. I have a three bedroom home, and typically only ever rent out one other room which is across the house. I live in a fairly nice upper-middle home in a quiet and safe neighborhood. I keep the place clean (I clean thoroughly once a week, I dislike messes) and all I really ask for in return is that payments are made on time and that you are kind to me and my fiancee. The rental agreement I provide is just a month-to-month agreement and it is fairly generous and lenient for the person renting the room. I do my best for background checks, personality checks, financial reviews, and etc. prior to accepting people in. The room costs typically $600 a month with a $350.00 security deposit which I return after inspection. This amount includes the monthly rent, internet, utilities, and pretty much everything minus their personal expenses. I do ask that they not let my two kittens outside (they're indoor cats) and that if they're going to use something (like plates or laundry detergent) that they just ask in advance - I'll likely say yes. For reference, the typical rent in my neighborhood for a room is about $1200, or $1800 for a one bedroom apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo due to recent financial struggles I had agreed to let a couple live with me. I figured I would give them one room with a discounted rate (Instead of $1200 for two people, it's just $800) and I would agree not to rent the second room while they are here (which means I'm earning less per month since not both rooms are rented). They did advise me they would have March as their last month as the girlfriend is pregnant and the baby would be due in late March. This was in November. I felt for them and wanted to help, and additionally I really needed the money at the time as my previous tenant had to leave on short notice (He was really nice though and we worked it out amicably, although at my financial burden).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially everything was fine but we started noticing many issues. They would drink and eat our food without asking. They would use stuff without asking. At one point early on we found one of my favorite cups was being used as a cup-holder for their toothbrushes under the sink in the guest bathroom. The girl (who is pregnant) is leaving cigarette butts outside my home and she also spends her time drinking on my patio and leaving her mess behind. They tamper with my thermostat and cause my electric bill to increase by about 60% (when I typically account for about a 40% increase with new tenants). Additionally, they started using my garage and extra room as storage despite being advised not to. I had to confront them on each issue and they pushed back either saying it wasn't them or they wouldn't do it anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I'd be furious but I wanted to best assist them so I let them have these extra luxuries at no expense because it would be easier than arguing - and I also couldn't find new tenants to replace them despite my many efforts.\n\n  \nFast forward to today, the rent is due and they advise me they are leaving in two weeks and they only want to pay for half the month. Now our agreement in no uncertain terms says they need to give me a 30 days notice and they owe for the remaining thirty days. I attempt to be nice but before I can text a reply the boyfriend sends me a huge insulting text message saying \"We are leaving because you neglect your cats and they have fleas. We should've gotten a thirty day notice on the fleas and we can't live like this so we deserve to not pay you the full rent.\" Later on he agreed to pay the full amount and \"we will discuss prorating it later\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my kittens are everything to me. They're indoor cats. Me and my fiancee spoil them. Recently (as of about 15 days ago) we discovered a flea problem. Immediately we notified them, bug-bombed the house, brushed them, shampooed them, gave them anti-flea treatment and they came back again as of yesterday; so I intend to get in contact with an exterminator to see what options are available (as they may be in places I can't get to with conventional means).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ended up being a longer post than I intended so I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom, but am I an asshole for demanding they pay the full rental amount as agreed by on our contract - and even more - I provided them official thirty day notice as of today to vacate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I accepted a pregnant couple into my home with a month-to-month agreement. They're trashy people and I've been nothing but kind while they drink and smoke on my patio together. Today they asked me to only pay a part of their rent and leave early, violating our monthly agreement which puts me in a rough financial spot.",

There is a bus stop two or three blocks from my apt that he could take directly to work.\n\nNext day: He leaves to go to the bus stop and when he sees the streets he immediately snapchats me that I am an ass for not driving him because the streets are fine (which I did not know).

I've wanted to be a mom my whole life but right now, I'm only 17 (just turned 17 a few weeks ago) and need to focus on school and working my part time job to save up for my first apartment, so I don't know that much about caring for babies. One day, my mom's friend, let's call her E, comes up to me and says, \"Hey - my name- wanna make a quick few bucks?\" I say yes because I was running low on money and I didn't want to have to dip into my savings to help my mom pay rent.

E told me that she'll put the baby down to sleep before she leaves and I thought \"this should be easy\" by the time 2:00 am rolls around I'm having an extreme panic attack because the baby is crying and I don't know what's wrong (Not the greatest with kids and don't know that much on how to care for them, remember?) I've tried calling my mom 20 times and left 15 voicemails, and tried calling E a few times but it just went straight to voicemail. At 2:30 ish, E comes and gets the baby and leaves.

Now when I talk to either E or her boyfriend they act like I'm a huge incontinence on everything. The reason I couldn't get should of my mom was because her phone was in her purse inside the bar while my mom was outside yelling at E to go home to get her baby.

This makes my emotions switch on a dime and causes me to see through something called \"black and white\" vision (basically I can go from hating someone to adoring them for no apparent reason).\n\nSo I've never really dated anyone mostly because I'm a flaming homosexual and the only people attracted to me are guys. A few months ago one of my friends openly stated she had a crush on me. This kind of shocked me because I had a but of a crush on her as well, but she had a boyfriend. \n\nWe had talked a bit and a few days later I told her that I get really anxious and a relationship wouldnt be good for either of us mentally. (She has depression aswell) Besides, I didnt want her to cheat on her boyfriend. \n\nShe said that she understood and I thought we would go back to being friends. I was wrong. Whenever I'd go get lunch and sit with a few of my friends she would get really affectionate with me; aka hold my hand, hug me, etc. This would be fine but 1: we weren't dating and 2: touching me made me really uncomfortable.\n\nI didn't say anything but I didnt really share the affections. That night she texted me, asking if I was mad at her. I had explained that I wasnt mad but just got really anxious when people touch me. I also went on a long tangent about how we shouldn't date because my BPD makes it extremly difficult for both people in the relationship. She seemed understanding so I thought that was it.\n\nA few days after I was in a very bad place mentally and it showed. She talked with me and made me feel a lot better, which in turn led me to get clingy that day. I wanted to hold her and hug her, even if that was very odd for me. I needed someone to hug that day, and she was that person. I guess she assumed that was the normal and for the next few weeks tried holding and kissing me. I was visibly anxious once again and told her that it made me uncomfortable. \n\nShe took this as anger and ended up avoiding me for the next week because she thought I was mad at her. This was not true and I had confronted her about it. After this things went back to normal, and by normal it meant she was clingy and close to me again. \n\nNow I knew she had her own problems and I really didn't want to cause things to go worse for her. This meant I let her hold me close no matter how uncomfortable it made me. I wanted to help her and by avoiding her efforts it obviously affected her negativly.\n\nThis went on for a while and I kind of let it happen. It took its toll on me, getting me into a worse state by the day. The only time I drew the line was when she invited me to her house for a dinner the very day. I got anxious at the thought and frantically made any excuse I could. She told me how important it was to her and I told that I couldn't. This led to a mini fight and she ghosted me for a week. Again she thought I was mad at her and had again explained that situations made me very anxious and could send me into a very bad panic attack.\n\nAgain things back to normal. Up until I had snapped. I got upset and told her to please stop touching me and to stop getting upset after I dont answer her constant calls or texted. I got mad because she wouldnt listen to me and we technically broke up.

            "input": "Ah. Ok. So.\n\nFrom very early on in our relationship, I knew my SO was very headstrong. He told me, his friends told me, his family told me, it's also super obvious, I'd seen it in action. We agree on the big things so it's ok - we were always completely aligned in our political beliefs, religious beliefs, family future plans, etc. All the important things. And the little things? Well, I'm the least headstrong person so it didn't really bother me, because we weren't really butting heads. But it does effect me. I will focus on 1 example below, but just know that this stuff happens all over our life - with stuuuuupid little things like colours, apartments, kitchen supplies, music, tech, what to watch on Netflix, whatever (nothing major though). Anyway, for this main example though, all you have to know is that I like mushrooms (I think).\n\nMe: \"Hey, do you want mushrooms for dinner? I love mushrooms.\"\n\nHe says, \"They're disgusting.\" \n\nI say, \"Really? What kinds have you had?\" \n\nHim: \"All of them. They're disgusting.\"\n\nMe: \"How were they cooked? Poorly cooked mushrooms can get a bit gross.\" \n\nHe says, \"No, I've had them all ways. They're disgusting.\" \n\nMe: \"Ah. Well, I really like them...\"\n\nWe now don't eat mushrooms ever and it's cool and I never bring it up. Don't want him to feel bad and I'm not going to force someone to eat mushrooms who could be allergic, you know? I'm very careful about picking/ordering food with no mushrooms when I can be. He tells waiters he's allergic to them when we go out to eat so that he doesn't get them in his food. I never buy or cook mushrooms for myself, which I used to love. Every time mushrooms come up he says they're disgusting and I began to associate this in my head. So naturally I stop eating mushrooms, and years pass, we get married, move to a new country together. I hate mushrooms now. Yes, that is on me - I'm way too easy-going/steamroller/influenced/people-pleaser or whatever other names you'd like to throw my way. Go ahead. I take responsibility for that, and I'm working on it, and I'm trying to be more in touch with my needs and what I want. It is difficult to just turn off. As I'm becoming more aware of this issue, I'm re-evaluating how we talk to each other and express our needs. I decide to ask him to disagree with me more respectfully and be more aware.\n\nHe doesn't really understand. He thinks that stating his own opinion shouldn't influence mine and it's not his fault at all - it is just all in my head. He says this, a lot. He's very much one of those people that always tries to be logical and remove emotion from situations. I do believe he's right; his opinion shouldn't influence mine. I agree in theory. But still it does. There is part of me deep down that just wants to please him because I love him and I'll always pretty much acquiesce to whatever he prefers to make him happy, I'm working on turning it off and getting more confident in myself. I'm asking that we both become aware of this, and try to adjust our life accordingly. I don't want him to stop expressing his opinions - I just want him to be aware of how he does it and try not to dismiss me and my opinion in the process. He doesn't understand. I start seeing a therapist.\n\nI'm working on myself with this therapist. And I enroll in a mindfulness group, where I talk about this issue regularly. I'm trying to be really critical and evaluate my self-confidence and practice exercises they give me to look at my needs and what makes me happy and try to express them and be more vocal. Sometimes, I am doing better and I tell him my opinion. But whenever he tells me his opinion, if it is not in complete agreement, I feel like he always gets his way. Furthermore, the way he says, 'Mushrooms are disgusting. All of them. They just are.' without ever acknowledging that maybe they're just gross for him and not gross for everyone is unfair. He'll say 'X is right. X is the only way' and if I think Y, well, he's so confident it just floods me with insecurities and questioning my own self. Yeah, sure, that's not his fault, but also, it's not exactly my choice either - why can't we try to work with communicating our wants and needs together? Why do I have to be AS headstrong as him if I ever want my opinion to be heard?\n\nAnyway, to summarise all of this up, years later, after we are married, I'm helping his mum prepare dinner and I discover she's put mushrooms in the egg rolls she's made. He goes to grab one, and I go, 'oh don't! You can't eat it! It has mushrooms in it.' and he goes, 'Nah, my mum knows how to make mushrooms edible.'\n\n...\n\nAITA for feeling completely gaslit and also enraged that he can't be like, 'oh mushrooms aren't my thing but it's ok you like them' or even 'i only like the way my mom makes mushrooms' rather than telling me that they're just always disgusting so incessantly that I literally feel incepted that they are and get nauseous at the thought of them??? AITA for wanting him to express his opinions in a more respectful way, and to be aware of how hard it is for me to disagree with him because I am a spineless jellyfish?? (Also, am I actually crazy here?)\n\nAnyway, that's mushroom-gate. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Please tell me. Am I the asshole?",

We dated semi-casually/semi-seriously when I was 16 and he was 19 for about a year. \n\nI describe it this way because we were teenagers, only communicated through texts (infrequently), saw each other maybe once a month (he joined the military shortly after we started talking), and did not have very much in common other than mutual attraction. However, we were “official” and did exchange ‘I love yous’ and talk jokingly but hopefully about having a future together. \n\nHe found out I was planning to cheat on him after he went through my phone and saw that I was also talking to other guys (I never was physically with anyone but I might have been had he not called me out on it and it’s still cheating regardless). When he confronted me, I lied about it, and we broke up right then and there but still continued to date on and off for about another year before we officially called it quits. \n\nI’m not excusing my behavior but I came from a really messed up background — I was in and out of foster care and was severely abused both at home and in the system. Because of this, I was also pretty messed up. I lied about little and big things, stole food and clothing, cheated on people and in school, manipulated others for my own gain, abused drugs and alcohol, was very promiscuous, and all around did not give a fuck about anyone other than myself and my 3 sisters. I was desperate to be loved but not trusting enough to ever give anyone the opportunity, so in order to protect myself and keep my options open because since that’s all I ever learned how to do, I was rarely faithful in my relationships. I was also a bitch about a lot of things but was still pretty submissive and doting in other ways, so I’m sure it was a confusing whirlwind for anyone I was involved with. All in all, I wasn’t the best person, let alone friend or girlfriend. \n\nI feel incredibly guilty about who I was back then and what I did to others. I have worked very hard in my adult life to never be that person again through lots of intensive therapy, medication, getting an education, and choosing to be better and do good each day. I can never take back the hurt I caused others but I have centered my life around making up for my transgressions through other means. I own and operate a non-profit that houses and fully sponsors homeless teens and young adults who have aged out of the system to receive counseling and work towards their future goals, whether that be college or entering the work force. This information is probably meaningless for the purpose of this but I feel as if it’s important to know that my behavior was circumstantial and it is not who I am.  \n\nMy ex and I still talk, we grew up together so he knows my situation, and I have apologized profusely to him over the years. He calls me up crying about once or twice every single year to tell me how I’ve ruined his ability to trust and love others and how hurt he still is. Sometimes he hits me up and is very flirtatious and tries to spark things up again (I always turn these advances down). Other times, if I’m dating someone and he knows who they are, he will antagonize them, insult them, and has, on occasion, gotten physical with them. I never severed ties with him because I always felt like he was justified in his treatment towards me and his resulting behavior because of how I wronged him, because I thought he was amazing and I felt like I was beneath him, and I felt so guilty for messing up such a good thing with a good guy that part of me hoped we’d get back together. \n\nRecently, about a few weeks ago, we were catching up and he started bragging to me about all these things he’s doing (he is very accomplished, has his PhD and has won a lot of awards, and is such an upstanding, good person, he adopted his cousin’s twin boys because the cousin is strung out on heroin, so he kind of deserves to brag and be complimented for all he’s done) but I thought it was strange because we hadn’t spoken in length for years. Then he started bragging about how he hadn’t dated anyone since we had been together, something he does often, even though this is a lie as I know at least three people he has seen and two he has been “official” with. He again blamed me for his unwillingness and inability to get involved with others and started saying straight up bullshit about the times we were together (saying we dated at a different time than we did by several years, saying we were never official and only talked for one month, etc). Then he started coming on to me, demanded I start sending him nudes regularly, and that we be fuck buddies. \n\nAt this point, I just lost it. I started yelling about how he can’t change the facts of things just because he doesn’t like how they turned out, how rude it is of him to always try to use me for sex (something he has admitted to in the past), that it’s not fair he pops back into my life to punish me every few months and that I was done with it, that I had always felt sorry about how I treated him before now but that I wasn’t sorry anymore because he’s acting creepy and pathetic, that it had been over 10 years since all this happened and he should have been over it by now and that not dating anyone in your twenties doesn’t make you some saint like he’s always painting himself out to be, I told him he needs to stop blaming me for his intimacy issues and stop using me to make himself feel good, that he is being ridiculous and that even though he thinks I’m the horrible person it’s really him, and that he needed professional help. I did say I wish I had never hurt him or anyone else but that I was a teenager, raising myself and living in constant fear, and that no one should be judged based off of who they were as teenagers and that he of all people should know that (he also did some very messed up things as a teenager which I won’t elaborate on as it’s not pertinent to this). \n\nHe got really pissed off and started cussing me out and saying that I was a good for nothing whore and that I would never be anything more, that everyone knew what a slut I was and that that no one actually liked me, that I can’t call him out on acting like a shitty person because I am the actual truly shitty person, that I don’t deserve to be happy or loved, that I was an idiot, that he wasn’t immature but that I was for raising my voice and always using slang words (I work with teenagers, it rubs off, what can I say), that I would never be as accomplished him and would never amount to anything, and that he was the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me. \n\nI rolled my eyes and laughed at him and get kind of snarky and told him I don’t owe him anything, that it was gracious of me to apologize as much as I had but that I didn’t have to but did because I wanted him to know it was me and not him, and that even if I did owe him something it most certainly wouldn’t be my body and that he’s raising his cousin’s boys badly if he believes that. \n\nHe said that since I just put out for everyone and since he’s already seen it all then I shouldn’t be such a bitch about us hooking up or sending him nudes and that it’s offensive to him that I’m shutting him down. \n\nI hold him that the only reason he was mad was because I was supposedly a whore but that I wouldn’t be a whore for him. \n\nHe stormed off after this and then blocked me on all social media a few minutes later. We haven’t talked or seen each other since. \n\nI don’t really feel bad about cheating on him anymore or about how he’s dealt with that (I still know it was wrong). My opinion of him has completely flipped from placing him on a pedestal to thinking lower of him and believing he’s just an egotistical jerk who’s got everyone else fooled (we’re from a small town and he’s very popular here, everyone loves him and thinks he is literally the world’s greatest person, and everyone he meets outside of our town think the same thing). \n\nA couple days after we fought, I started to feel like I am actually in the wrong for being mad at him, fussing at him, and for having stopped feeling bad, and for starting to feel kind of repulsed by him. I know that everything impacts each person differently and I don’t want to invalidate his feelings or belittle them and I know that everyone moves on or doesn’t at their own pace and own prerogative and it’s not my position to say how or when someone does or doesn’t do this. I know that even though I might have seen our relationship as silly and was not really invested in it or him, he may have been very committed and in love and I could have crushed him, so just because I feel one way doesn’t mean he will feel the same way, and I can’t project that into him. \n\nBut truth be told, and to be quite blunt about it, I truly just feel like he’s being a little bitch about it and that he has now wronged me so we’re even somehow. \n\nI don’t really know how to feel about how I’m feeling and keep switching between feeling like I crossed the line and will never be in the right when it comes to him because of our history OR feeling relieved, vindicated, and very appalled at and vexed by him. \n\nI’m just here looking for some unbiased clarification as of course my friends support my side of it just as I’m sure his friends support his. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?

At the time his mom wasn't working, and his sister was in college and had never worked before.\n\nI'm close with his family, we get together a couple times a month and for the most part get along well. However, there is certainly a cultural divide. The family is from the middle east, it's not unusual at big family gatherings for my FIL to call out my husband, in front of his extended family, for being cheap. Which I know bothers my husband, though it doesn't push him to change our spending habits. His father can be a generous person, it is not unusual for him to decide in the moment to drop $100  for everyone's dinner. \n\nSix months into the marriage, my SIL had her birthday and her dad surprised her with a brand new I-Phone. During the party my husband looked troubled, I kept asking what was up and he would just shake his head, \"Not now.\" On the drive home he took out his phone and checked our phone bill. My FIL had purchased the phone through our account, adding a payment plan. We were both furious, we turned the car around, my husband and he argued, and I completely lost my temper. When his sister found out, she was embarrassed and offered to return the phone (which my FIL refused to pay for,) neither my husband nor I felt right about that, so we dropped it. \n\nWe have now been paying for everyone's phones for two years. We have lived on our own the entirety of that time (I've had my own place since I met my husband.) My MIL has been working for a year. My SIL graduated and now is working a fairly decent job. Her boyfriend is also working but in retail. All of them live together with my FIL. \n\nMy husband suggested they begin to pay for their own phones in a month's time and the shtf. My SIL said straight out, \"No,\" like it was her decision. It was the most uncomfortable week ever. Their arguments were that it was family obligation, and that because individually they make less than us (everyone but my FIL,) that we should continue to pay.\n\nWe were holding firm in our decision, then my FIL got injured at work and went on unpaid leave. So we backed off, because that would have been messed up, and helped out with their electric bill. But, now he's working again, and I want to move forward with our plan. My husband has lost the desire to though, seeing his father in a weakened state has left him unsure of what to do here. I can get waiting but will this ever happen, should this ever happen?

His parents consider me a son (I've been known them for well over ten years). Kara comes from a wealthy family. Four years ago, I met Kara at a hospital internship and introduced her to my friend group. Kara and Jim started dating last summer and she moved into Jim's room within the month they started dating (Jim is working on his second bachelor's, so he lives in his parents basement).\n\nThis semester I moved in with my SO (dating 5.5 years now) to her dorm at school. My home life isn't the best, domestic abuse and all that, so I was ecstatic for this change. Each person in the suite has their own room and bathroom.\n\nSo the semester goes on. Kara's parents don't know she is living with Jim, so they are still paying for her dorm room (about $14K a year). She uses it as a glorified supply closet, Kara slept there maybe once or twice. At Jim's house, Kara does not do her own laundry, do chores, or pick up after herself. As Jim and Kara have been together, Kara has distanced herself more and more from the group.\n\nOverall, Jim and Kara's relationship is so-so. She says she has anxiety driving, so Jim drives her to school even on the days he doesn't have school. Keep in mind, it's a 30 minute commute. The last time Jim told her he can't drive her anymore, she gave him the cold shoulder for days until he started driving her to school again. I think Jim just stays with her because she likes video games.\n\nDuring the semester I am taking a full course load and working three jobs. Christmas rolls around and we throw a party. Before everyone gets there, Kara makes a comment about how surprised she was that I am at the party instead of working because \"all I care about is money.\"\n\nI make a sarcastic comment agreeing with her, that all I care about is money. Kara says I \"am mooching off someone else's money\" (referring to me staying with my SO in her dorm which my SO's parents pay for). I point out that maybe she should care a little more about money because of her dad paying for her dorm she doesn't use while she mooches off her boyfriend by living in his parent's basement. She leaves and doesn't speak to me for 2 months.\n\nToday I asked Kara, nice as you please, if she has a problem with me. She says yes, she hates me, and she doesn't want me in her life anymore. She already told Jim I can't go to their wedding (they aren't engaged?) She goes on ad nauseum about how much she hates me and how I am the worst person alive. I implore her to tell me what I did wrong, or what features about me are so awful. That way, I can work on them, and maybe become a better person. She refuses to tell me a single thing off her \"huge list of awful features\" she has of me and ends up slamming the door in my face.\n\nTLDR: I was friends with a girl, now she says \"I am the worst person alive.\"",

(or so my dad always tells me)  He got furious and said that i was being dishonest breaking our \"Healthy Relationship\" and threatened to take away my jobs if i didn't stick to his schedule.  my mom said that my jobs are good for me and was fine with me handing in assignments late, but there agreement stated that my dad was in charge of our schoolwork. and now he get's pissed every time i snap at him and continues to threaten to take things away  (my phone, computer, etc) so now i have to pretend to be cool with him so he doesn't blow up in my face again.\n\nTL;DR\n\n AITA for hating my dad because he threatens to have me fired because i hand in assignments late",

            "input": "Context: we have an extension to the house which is separate from the main building with 3 rooms 1 bathroom etc that our family uses to rent out to other people.\n\nLast Monday, a person (let's name him Ted) who has rented rooms before wanted to come back and rent them out again because he didn't feel safe in his previous area due to an ex stalking him (but never went to the police about it). I made it very clear to him that if Ted wanted to stay, he would have to pay the Bond + rent upfront before he could stay for even 1 night to which he happily agreed to but said he'd pay on Friday.\n\nThe next morning (Tuesday), I woke up to see something strange, which was Ted's car in the driveway, and to my surprise, he had already crashed a night in the area which disappointed me because I thought he wouldn't do anything like that. When I woke Ted up, his voice was muddled and unintelligible, he wasn't able to give a proper reason as to why he stayed the night, only saying \"i won't do this again, and I will make sure I'll pay by Friday\". He then asks when I head out to university on Friday which I said 11AM, and he replied with \"That'll be easy, I'll come by before then and pay up\". \n\nCome Friday morning, Ted never showed up, so I tried contacting him a few times before leaving for university, he got back to me around 12PM saying \"I was packing my stuff, and on a phone call with a possible employer, sorry about that, you have my word that I'll come by tomorrow before 12PM.\" \nIt was already at this point I was doubting my decision to let him stay if he can't uphold his word, so I decided to give him one more chance to see if he changed.\n\nSaturday morning, he didn't show up again, no signs of contacting me via call or text and at this point I really felt like I can't let him stay if he doesn't hold his word to do something as simple as showing up in the morning and pay the Bond + rent. So I tried calling him once in the afternoon, no response, and around 10 times in the evening to get a text saying \"I am in another call, will call you back\" and so I waited. Till around 1:30AM I waited for his call back to see why he didn't show up, only to not get a phone call.\n\nSunday morning (today), Ted still hasn't shown up and I have tried ringing him a few times to get a text saying \"Can't speak right now, will call you back later\". It was at this point I decided to make the decision to reply with \"I'll make this easier for you, leave. This has been unacceptable and you know that\". The reason why it's unacceptable is because this isn't the only time he's done something like this, he's done it before when he stayed before (like 9 months ago). He told me on Monday that he was a changed man and out of the few interactions over the week, I could tell he hasn't at all. \n\nAll he needed to do was to show up and pay the bond + rent, or inform me that something was going on but he never said anything other than \"call you later\".\n\nAm I the Asshole for doing what I did?",

            "input": "I want to give you guys a little idea about the context, so this post is probably going to be a little long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy gf (20f) and I (21m) have a LDR. This obviously brings some difficulties, as we only see eachother every three months or so. We're both in uni, but she has been struggling alot with motivation and anxiety. She doesn't enjoy the path she's going and as a result has been very down the last months. She wants to quit uni, but has absolutely no idea what to do instead. I have been helping her as much as I can, I think. I am always trying to give her advice, help her with motivation, be supportive when she is feeling down etc. But I am getting a little frustrated about the fact that she is not following any advice i give her! I have been helping her with her with options she could explore instead of uni, i've told her that it would be good to get a therapist to help her with her anxiety (as I know I just simply fix that for her) etc. The problem is that, instead of working towards a solution, or trying to find a passion, she decides to do nothing. I know it is a scary situation to not know what the hell you want to do with your life, but the problem is that she has been getting angry with me because supposedly i am not helping her \"enough\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example is that would ask me: What should i do? Should I quit uni, should I continue? What would you do? My answer to this was simply: I would not continue with uni if you KNOW that it is not going to make you happy. \n\nShe then gets frustrated and tells me that I always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to tell her what to do! It's like she expects me to know exactly which career is going to make her happy? I really dont know either obviously. I told her that maybe you could go to the US for a couple months to study English, kinda like a gap year. But then she refuses to look into things like that. It's like she just expects to one day wake up and have found her passion. As you can understand this lethargy is making me slightly annoyed, because like I said, she refuses to actually take the advice that i give her, and then she gets mad at me for not helping her enough. Anyways, this was some background information. Now to the actual situation that I am dealing with now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night we were on the phone and the same subject came up. I could tell by her voice that something was wrong, so I asked her what was up. She then said that she was just confused because she doesnt know what the fuck she wants to do with her life. She then (again) told me that I am not helping her enough. Of course this kinda struck a nerve with me, because i have been doing everything i can to help her. Ive been doing a lot of research for her, exploring different options etc. Anyways, i responded with: \"babe, but you haven't been doing any of the things i told you! You haven't told your parents you want to go to a psychologist, you haven't been going to the gym, you haven't done the research to go to america, you havent read any books, you havent listened to any audiobooks on anxiety, you havent meditated, etc. I have given you so many options on how to feel better, but youre just not listening to me!\"  She then gets mad at me that i always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to help her.. So i try (for the millionth time) to give her my opinion on the matter, and i try to explain to her what i would do in her shoes. But as i try to talk, she just keeps interrupting me about everything i say. She doesn't let me talk at all and just keeps rambling on about how I don't care about her, how I don't help her enough etc. I keep asking her: can you stop interrupting me please? This literally goes on for 15 minutes, i just cant say 3 words withour her interrupting me, and telling me that im not supporitve enough. So now I am getting really frustrated, because i am trying to HELP her, but instead of listening to what i have to say she decides to interrupt me and ramble on about how i DONT help her. So yea, at this point im getting very very annoyed and angry, but i try to stay calm because we've had some prior issues about me \"yelling at her\" and she says that i have anger issues, even though i have never called her any bad names other than maybe \"hypocrite\", i've never threatened her etc, but yea she stills believes i have anger issues because i tend to raise my voice in arguments when i get frustrated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, back to the story. Gf and I are still on the phone, and i keep telling her: can i talk now? Are you done? Can i please talk without you interrupting me? So then i tell her that I am getting very frustrated that she doesn't let me finish my story, and that she really has to stop interrupting me. While i tell her this, she decides AGAIN to answer mid-sentence and i just get very angry and yell at her: Can you just SHUT UP AND STOP INTERRUPTING ME PLEASE! I admit I did yell this quite aggresively, but I was just so exasperated. After i yelled at her she tells me i broke the rule (of not yelling) and that she is done, that she cant be with someone that treats her so poorly, that i do not respect her, that no matter how many times she interrupts me i should NEVER disrespect her like that etc. I then tell her I did not treat her badly, and that she doesn't see her own flaws, and that I try everything to help her but that she just doesn't appreciate my help. I then hang up. She now demands that i apolize for my behavior, and that I promise her that I will get therapy to help me with my anger issues ( which i dont believe i have). So i refuse to apologize, and she wants to break up if i do not say sorry. So yea, thats where we are now. AITA for not apologizing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "OK so please stay with me this is a very complex situation. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and together for over 8. For a little over 3 years we have lived in NYC which I absolutely hate. It overwhelms me, it is outrageously expensive, and is just hard to live in unless you are one of the mega-rich. We moved to the city to pursue my wife's dream of becoming a professional actor. Initially, the plan was to live here for two years and if she had not accomplished much by that time we would move back home (we are from the southeast). \n\nDuring this time I have worked 4 different jobs and slowly made a decent living for us but it has been brutal. When we first moved I had to take a 100% commission job in sales just to get hired.  Seven days a week work because I had to sell or there was no money. Needless to say we blew through what savings we had pretty quickly, most of which was from selling my car to afford the first couple of months rent. After the sales job I worked for a restaurant start up for a year, then broke in to healthcare management, and now manage a clinic. I have a good employer at this point, and our finances are at long last somewhat stable (been there 8 months). \n\nMy wife has made consistent progress in becoming an actor and trying to join one of the acting unions. She had to start with choir and ensemble roles, but over the time we have spent here she has worked and worked and made it in to principal roles and paid contracts. Now, when I say paid I mean technically they get a check but it is criminal what these theatre companies are able to get away with (we are talking like $200/week). I am extremely proud of her, and I have zero doubts that she isn't always doing her best to make something happen. I love my wife dearly and I know she loves me.\n\nThat said, I have always been the one that has to pay all of our bills. Rent, Internet, Phone, Electric I pay 100% every month and buy most of our groceries. I have very little residual income at the end of each month after bills though fortunately at this point I do have some going in to a 401k. I was already starting to burn out and then a real life change occured....\n\nMy father passed away unexpectedly last spring. We knew he wasn't in great health, but this was a shock. I got the call one morning and he was just gone. I loved my dad, he was a tremendous man who made sure I had good opportunities and was always around for me as I grew up. I was so fortunate to have a father that truly cared. I say that because this was a soul-crushing blow to me and has completely shaken me to my core and I still feel it every day.\n\nBefore his death, I had the resolve from knowing that even though I didn't like living in NYC my wife loves it and that I am being a good spouse for giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream. But now I can't handle it. I have panic attacks all the time, I have been going to a psychologist since November and have had no significant breakthroughs. I feel depressed all the time. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but finding one that takes our insurance has been tough. I have a very hard time completing even basic functions, and I know that my mom and brother are struggling. \n\nI want to move back south asap and get closer to our family. I want to start preparing for my wife and I's life together and  getting to a place where I can deal with this grief. We speak about it all the time and I know she doesn't want to leave NYC. She will but her conditions have been that I have to have a job lined up before we can, and she only really is OK with moving to Atlanta, Georgia (we are not from Georgia) because there is a market for her work there. I am torn because part of me thinks that my health should 100% be a drop everything and lets get you right sort of scenario for her but it doesn't seem to be all of the time. Then I am also torn because I feel I should be stronger and able to handle these things so that she can keep working on what she wants whether it be in NYC or elsewhere. I think my mental stability has about 6 months tops left in the city before I really break.\n\nSo I guess all of that is to ask this question. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?\n\nThank you to anyone kind enough to read through that wall of text.\n\ntl,dr\n\nI relocated to NYC for my wife a little over 3 years ago to support her in her dream of being a professional actor. I hate living there, she loves it. I am the breadwinner and pay 100% of our bills, but she has made progress in establishing her career. My father passed away last spring and now my mental health has gone to s**t with the grief making the anxiety I have from living in the city, on top of the sheer grief itself, even worse. She doesn't want to leave but will concede to relocating to ATL, GA as there is a market there for her work. I just want to get close to home. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?",

We went on several fun dates and chatted daily about our interests, kinks, life goals, the whole shebang. I was feeling really comfortable and safe with Wallace and after some negotiating we agreed to a sleepover at his place and to have our first sexy times (woohoo!). \n\nHowever, that's where my excitement ended.. When I got to his place I found it to be dark, dirty, empty walls and gross furniture, mattress on the floor, etc. It looked like a college apartment. Then, he introduced me to his dog, a rescue dog who is extremely nervous. I'm not blaming the dog at all, but from the second I walked in the door she wouldn't stop barking at me, and she is a big dog, also acting like she was nipping at my hands. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without her barking continuously outside the door. I was getting uncomfortable at this point, but we retired to his room and I thought, \"Ok! Rough start, but let's have a good fun sexy time!\" I wanted to be in the moment and enjoy getting to explore this person's body for the first time, but that dog barked literally every second we were having sex. The whole time non-stop. We make dinner, to dog barking at me. We went on a walk, the dog barked at me, we came back and started to wind down to go to bed but the dog wouldn't sleep unless it was in the room with us and she kept coming up to me in the night and just staring at me and if I moved she'd start barking and growling. I felt paralyzed. I realized at about 4 am that I was having a panic attack because I felt trapped, I couldn't move or leave without the dog barking more and I was exhausted and stressed. I stayed just frozen in panic for hours. eventually Wallace moved, looked over and realizing I was awake asked if I was ok. I felt like the interaction unfroze me suddenly and I just stammered I had to leave, that I had a nice time with him but that I had to go immediately and I quickly got up and gathered my things and left. \n\nSince that incident, I just don't find Wallace attractive to me. It was like a lightswitch and I've never had that happen before. Am I the asshole for just flat out losing interest in him because of this? I feel like I built of so much hope and interest in our future and now that is all just gone on my end. I communicated with him that I was no longer interested, and he's really hurt and blindsided but honestly so am I? I really liked him and the feeling is just.... gone suddenly. \n\nTLDR; I was happy and excited about a new relationship with someone, but I lost interest after seeing how he lived and after his dog wouldn't stop barking at me.",

            "input": "Hello, all! First time posting to this sub, so I hope everything is in order as far as the rules go. I'm sharing this story to find out who is *truly* the asshole in this situation. I know this may seem kind of petty, but it has been bothering me for a little while now. This post will be a bit long, but I will include a TL;DR at the end.\n\nA little backstory: In the Fall term of 2016, I enrolled in a local University along with 2 of my friends. I keep to myself most of the time, going with the flow, and only speak up around friends or when I truly feel like I have something to add to the conversation among strangers, so finding a friend that first semester was kind of difficult. One of my friends introduced me to the asshole in question (AIQ from now on) about 2 months into the term. Everything seemed nice enough in the beginning, and we became friends in the spring semester after taking a foreign language class together. Jump to the fall term (2017), when my teacher announced an upcoming study abroad opportunity in the summer (2018). We were both excited to go, as this could be our only chance of going to a different country (AIQ is a STEM major so she was worried about spending a full term away and how her classes would be, and my mom would not allow me to spend a year away from home since it was my first time going out of the state). Both of us saved up to pay the program fee (faculty-led), deposits, and multi-city plane ticket (we studied abroad in 2 countries that summer). All the while during our free time in class, we talked about how much we couldn't wait to go, what we hoped the cities to be like, where we would go during our free time, etc. Now on to the events that transpired and what led me to cut ties with AIQ.\n\nIn the first country, everyone got along (along with the AIQ and I, there were 11 other people - again it was a faculty-led program, meaning that the foreign language instructors from the university went with us so there wasn't a bunch of people they had to look after). However, when we arrived in the second country, everything kind of turned to shit between the AIQ and I. It began with the AIQ getting snappy and rude with me whenever I asked a general question, even when I wasn't talking to them in particular. If I suggested we do something, she'd say \" we already did that yesterday without you\" or \"we're tired of doing that\". We had to share a room together in the second country, and she held on to the key because she could attach it to her wallet and we thought it'd be easier than trying to look through my small bag in case it sunk down to the bottom. Twice, she came back very late (at around 11:15, which was later than the teacher wanted us to be out), so I waited in the shared space of two other group members until she came back (which was around a 30 minute wait). The first time, she was very apologetic, saying that the train was late (very unusual considering that the trains in this country run every 5 minutes or so), but I accepted her apology. The second time (only two days later), she just huffed past me, unlocked the door, set her bags down (she had went shopping again), and didn't say a word to me until the next morning. As each day passed, communication between us became very limited. Me, not talking to her because I really didn't want to deal with her attitude, and her, for whatever reason she had made up. She only had this attitude with me and she treated the other group members with friendliness and were open to what they wanted to do (although she claimed she disliked two of the other group members, she didn't have an attitude with them).  \n\nShe kept that attitude towards me until we departed for home. The remainder of that summer, I didn't speak to her at all- not even a text. When I saw her again this semester (we take the same foreign language class now), she acted like nothing was wrong and even hugged me- something that she'd never done. We talked about how our lives were so busy now that we've begun our upper level course work. After that first day of class, I didn't talk to her very much because now I know what she is truly like. Friendly at first, but very rude and condescending once you've spent time with her.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not talking to a friend after she was mean to me when we studied abroad?",

A friend and I hydroplaned while entering the freeway on a roundabout, which caused the little Yaris we were in to slide into oncoming traffic. We got broadsided by a semi-truck. Amazingly, we both walked away unscathed, with the exception of some back pain on my part.\n\nIn the days following the accident I had an amazing outpouring of love and affection from my friends. People brought me food, family from out of state called to check in on me, and one of my college TAs was even cool enough to drop by with some edibles to help with my back pain.\n\nTwo days after the accident I got a message from my friend Eliza asking if I wanted some company. I said yes, and asked her if she could do me a huge favor when she got here and take my trash to the dumpster. I live in a second story apartment and getting down the stairs with a bag of garbage and a bad back just seemed like a monster of a mission at the time. Eliza says of course, and everything is set.\n\nCue to a few hours later and I'm lying on my couch being stoned and pathetic. I hear a rattling at my door and in walks Eliza, who I fully expected, but she also had our friend Wren with her, who I did not expect. Wren can be a bit much in a lot of ways.\n\nAfter greetings Eliza jumps into cleaning my kitchen, which I appreciated, but I kept trying to tell her that all I needed was the trash taken out. Eliza didn't listen.\n\nI had a basket of unfolded laundry sitting in my living room. Wren jumped right into folding that. Again, I kept insisting that she did not have to do that, and again, I was ignored. At one point, she pulled a pair of my underwear out and I immediately was like, \"hey, I don't like other people touching my underwear. Please stop.\" Wren took this as an opportunity to just chuckle, then proceeded to tell me a story about the first time she went to our friend Willowe's house and how she started cleaning and Willowe was uncomfortable and visibly angry, but Wren just kept going and how she could see that same discomfort in me and how she thinks it's funny.\n\nThis didn't sit well with me. Who the hell gets off on making their friends uncomfortable?\n\nSo I told Wren straight up that she needed to stop. I said I get that she's trying to help, but honestly, I'm sore and high and feeling really violated, which is mixing with my high and giving me this weird anxiety that I really don't like. I kind of snapped. Both Eliza and Wren felt the mood change, so they both left after that and said they were going to let me rest.\n\nI've spoken to Eliza since, but not Wren, and honestly, I don't want to talk to Wren. I don't think it's out of line for me to set boundaries and I don't think it's okay to intentionally cross someone's boundaries, even if it's in the name of \"just trying to help.\"",

That being said, our sex life has significantly dropped off, and I feel myself becoming less interested in her sexually and attracted to other women.  Let me be clear, I would never act on these feelings because I do love my fiancee, but I am beyond frustrated at this point.  I have talked to her about the fact that I am tired of being the constant initiator, and if I don't, then just nothing happens. And I mean months, not just a week or two.  She always apologizes and says she understands and she'll be better.  Which might lead to a handjob or sex once or twice over the course of the next couple of weeks, then just back to nothing.

She swears that she loves having sex with me and reaches the finish line every time we are intimate, but her actions and body language says otherwise.  \n\nOn top of it, I feel our increasingly distant intimacy giving me feelings of insecurity that I have not felt with her before.

My mother told me months ago he was engaged to be married, but I never received an invitation. I have not spoken to him in over a year because he decided to spout off a bunch of anti military 'your husband is just a killer' B.S. two days after my husband left on deployment. (Myself, or my husband do not expect people to kiss his ass, if that's my brother's opinion then whatever, but going off about it two days after my husband left was inappropriate and poor timing IMO. He was extremely rude and explosive about his opinion and said my husband would deserve whatever happened to him on deployment, if he was hurt or killed, because the U.S. was responsible for the deaths of innocent people)\n\nAnyway, yesterday out of the blue, he sends me a messenge on facebook asking me if I would fly to Vegas to be at his wedding in October. I said I would see what I could do because I would flying with two young children across country because my husband would be deployed again. Also, a cross country ticket and hotel in Vegas is pretty pricey. He seemed happy with this answer and said he would let me know definite dates soon. And that was it. \n\nI was a little upset after this exchange for a few reasons:\n\n1) He never acknowledged we haven't spoken for a year, or that he said some messed up stuff to me, about my husband. \n\n2) My son is two and half and he has never acknowledged that his nephew exsists. He never congratulated me on this pregnancy or his birth. Never asks me about him or acknowledges him in anyway.\n\n3) He knows I'm pregnant again, due in four weeks and have been extremely ill throughout with HG and liver problems and never asked if I was ok, how I was doing or about the baby. I've been hospitalized a few times, all of which he knows about because my mother tells him about it. \n\n4) He's always crying that family should support family no matter what when he has something going on,  but is never supportive of any family when they have something going. I.E. he was still living in the same town as my older brother when his daughter was born, but never went to the hospital to see her and didnt bother to meet her until a family event months later. \n\nAfter thinking about all of this, I didn't see why I even should spend the money and go through the headache of long flight with two small children. However my parents and some family members have told me I am being petty and should just be a good sister and go. To the point where I'm starting to question if they're being ridiculous or if I'm really just being petty.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I just say fuck it, like he has for so long?",

Everything was fine until 3 weeks ago when I got a FB message from a girl that was screenshots of their conversation. He created a fake Insta account messaging her telling her how gorgeous she is, etc. Note, this is not the first time this happened. So I confront him, he denies it, I have proof, he lies, I tell him he has to leave, he does. A few days pass and we talk about what happened; he said he had been suppressing stuff that made him unhappy. Well, this is the SAME reason he reached out to a girl the first time. At this point, I am SO mad that he would throw away our relationship over simply not coming to me and communicating “Hey, my feelings are hurt over X, Y and Z.” and then we can talk, fix it and be happy again. I am willing to work through this and make us work again. He says he needs his time.\n\nWe met up after a 1.5 weeks, he says the same thing; he needs more time to figure himself out. So I ask him upfront, are there any other girls in the picture? He tells me straight up, no. He isn’t interested, doesn’t want anything to do with girls, just wants to be alone and figure himself out. He asks me for another week of time and asks me to wait for him. I oblige. Monday rolls around, he texts me wanting to get back together. He makes plans to pack up his stuff (he’s been staying at a friend’s who’s lease is up March 1st) and come home today.\n\nDuring our time apart, through mutual friends, I saw him drunk at a club. So I tell him I need to know if anything happened. He said yes, he had a one night stand. I am devastated. We had been apart for less than 2 weeks when he hooked up with a girl during the extra week that HE requested while asking me to wait for him. At this point, I am broken and furious. I tell him he can’t come back and I don’t want to work things out. He tells me he’s moving back in anyway. I ask him to move in with his parents which would be free and he refuses. He says he can’t afford two rents for his own place and he refuses to pay for a place that he can’t live in. I am crushed; all I want is to move forward with my life and be able to get over him but I can’t do that when I have to see him every day for the next 6 months. I’m on student loans so I can’t afford the rent alone. So here he is, he cheats on me, asks me to wait for him, goes and has a one night stand, and then still gets to come back home? He gets to have his cake and eat it too. I feel like I’m being manipulated and controlled in his forcing me to live with him after all of this. So tonight I want to revisit the idea of him moving back in with his parents. Maybe I can talk to the complex about moving into a smaller apartment so the rent is less for us both. So AITA for asking him to move back in with his parents and still pay his half of the rent because this is his fuck up and he is legally obligated to pay?",

            "input": "This argument has been going on for years between me and my parents, but has quieted down a little bit in the recent years since I've started college. The argument is that I don't want to actively pursue a relationship with the majority of my siblings, and though I've stopped actively avoiding them, I don't want them in my life (with the exception of two of my older brothers). This had always upset my parents, who firmly believe that you don't have to like your family but you still have to love them. In the end I cave and argue to do whatever my parents ask of me, but I want that to change now that I have started college. Thankfully now I don't interact with my siblings much at all, except for one brother whom I'm really close with and goes to college with me.\n\nBefore however, my parents would have me share rooms with my siblings who had moved back in for a reason or another, and in any argument that would start between me and another siblings, I would be excepted to be mature about it and let the situation go, because I was the most responsible. More often than not I was told to bite my tongue around my other siblings and whenever I would avoid them my parents would guilt trip me into hanging out with them.\n\nSo, some background on why I hate my siblings so much, most at least. At least 4 of my siblings are current or recovering drug addicts, and I think a few still are in trouble with the law. One reason I personally don't want them near me is because I don't want to be associated with anything illegal. \n\nAnother reason is the way they treat me and my parents. Since I'm the youngest I don't have perfect memory of their childhoods or mine for that matter. But I remember a lot of stories that I've been told by my parents about my siblings. A lot of them used to steal from us, probably to buy drugs. Two of my siblings I especially want to avoid are my sister and one of my oldest brothers.\n\n(Some background: anger issues and disabilities practically run in my family, which makes arguments that much more worse. I am legally disabled and have been since 7 years old, and I have medications I take every day for my disabilities.) My only sister, several years ago when I was in elementary school, we believe had stolen my medication and sold it. My parents had because so upset and worried, that they installed a lock on the cabinet where the meds were, which I believe conveniently was dismantled about two weeks later. She, in my opinion, has always put drugs and her self before anyone else. Often did drugs or drank in front of my, behind my parents back. Would be in and out of prison constantly. Would call random people in the middle of the night while I was trying to sleep (we shared a room until she moved out at 18). And never respected anyone. She constantly starts drama with anyone, isn't below using violence to get her way and will readily complain about being poor and then buy like $50 manicures every week. Me and her were never really close, as she preferred her friends over me and would get mad at my parents when they would make her play with me. The only times she would \"play with me\" voluntarily (for the most part that I can remember) was when should would take me or my brother somewhere under the impression of going somewhere to play, when she really would be taking us to where should could meet friends, or boyfriends, and on one occasion drink and smoke in front of me, I was 7. At 11 it was common knowledge for me not to touch our laundry basket because I was afraid of breaking a liquor bottle that she occasionally hid in there. I remember at one point, I was maybe 9, me, my sister and my mom were in the car going somewhere and my sister was complaining about how clingy I was. My mom said smiling that my sister was the one who begged for a little sister and my sister responded in an upset tone \"well I regret it\". And I don't think I've ever felt that unloved and worthless before. Don't get me wrong I have loving parents and my siblings say they love me. But in that moment I think I finally realized I was never going to get the loving relationship with my sister that was like it was in the movies or the way my friends described their sister were like.\n\nIn another instance one of my older brothers, his wife and their baby was living with us for 2 years (I believe rent free or incredibly cheap, as my parents believed in helping family when they are down). Though we have no solid proof we believe they were addicts. Some reasons for our suspicions were random pills scattered in drawers or on tables (no bottle in sight), our codine cough syrup was weirdly empty after a few months of them living there (even though only two people used it and neither said it was anything less than half full. And it was a BIG bottle too), and they always worked jobs that would pay them in cash at the end of the night (even though they conveniently seemed to never half enough money for anything that they begged/made my parents buy for my nephew (their son)). They would occasionally make me baby sit my newphew with no thanks or pay. Sometimes they woild leave me with him, saying they would be back at 10 pm or soemthing but wouldnt be found til 2 am. Always made my dad or another one of my older brothers baby sit my nephew constantly, even when they were in the house themselves, they just wouldn't pay attention to him and my parents would have to step up to the plate. During the first year they were there Christmas had passed and everyone got gifts, I had gotten a new camera I was really exited about and a bag for it. But since I didn't need it I put it away in my closet, that a shared with my niece because we shared a room. Fast forward 4 months and I decide I know a perfect place I could take pictures of with my camera. I go looking for it and it's gone, only the travel bag is left. I was fuming and told my parents, we searched but never found it. My parents believe it was stolen and pawned my brother or his now ex wife, as they had done the same with an xbox they had rented in my mom's name. I remember vividly, no words of apologies, but my parents asking how I could be so careless leaving something expensive \"lying around\" when I know my siblings have stolen stuff before. I still feel guilty about not being more careful to this day because I know the camera costed at least $300 which we definitely could have used to keep on tract with bills.\n\nIn the end, though my siblings have grown up some and changed in the time since I've last seen them. But a lot of the stuff they've done still mess me up today. I went through depression in high school for 2 years and during that I tried to get closure with my sister for the way I felt she treated me. I'll admit I didn't go about it the right way, I ended up explaining that I had been writing about things she had done when I was little and that I was sharing them with a self help group. She got mad and stormed off. My mom come to me and told me to accept that my sister would never apologize, that it was so long ago no one knows if what I remember actually happened and to just let it go. My sister ended up coming back and I apologized and sorta argued to move forward a forget the past (though I don't think I can). And while I'd like to think that they have changed, both have kids, their own homes, but still start drama on facebook, sister still continues to do drugs, fight and \"divorce\" her husband. I don't think I'll really ever be able to trust them. And I know that they've had their own issues to overcome that could be the cause of drug abuse (one was raped when they were a toddler. And the other had lived with a drug addicted mother till puberty) I don't feel that the way the choose to cope with it was okay or a right thing to put others through.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to be near them? I don't have the heart to tell any one it's because I'm afraid of letting them in my life and just being used for profit or gain again. Or should I stay firm if my parents ask me make accommodations for them, and tell them no? I want a relationship with my siblings but I feel that they don't really care. It's past the point of where I don't actually believe it when they say they love me, no matter how much I genuinely want them to.",

I had been wanting to be out of the relationship for over a year, but was always somehow reeled back in, gaslighted and manipulated. About 1 year into dating my ex (21M), I met an amazing guy. We really hit it off and became amazing friends- or at least that was my take on it. All my friends and even sometimes myself did have an idea that he was into me, but obviously nothing could have been said or done because of my relationship. \n\nSo I keep getting to know this guy, and started to develop some feelings for him. Things were not going well in my relationship, but I still felt really guilty to be having feelings for someone else, so I just ignored it and pushed all of that aside. \n\nFast forward to now. About one year after meeting this guy i’ve been getting close with. I finally ended my relationship and have been feeling amazing. Haven’t really been looking for anything. Me and the “friend” guy are still close and one night he started sending me flirty texts. We ended up talking about how we felt and he admitted to having feelings for me ever since we met, about a year ago. I told him that I felt something for him too. \n\nSo here’s the problem: he’s been in a “situation” with another girl for going on 5 months now. He’s talked to me about it a lot since we have been so close. Basically he doesn’t want to get super serious with her, even though it’s clear that she wants a defined relationship. So it seems they want different things, but they still hang out a lot. This guy seems to be pursuing me, and honestly I’m super into it. But he did mention to me one day that if that girl knew me and him were talking about this kind of stuff she would be pissed. So he’s being dishonest with her about what he’s been thinking about with me. Not sure how I feel about that either. \n\nBut WIBTA if I went along with his advances? I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes here but also could really see me and this guy going well together, and maybe even just having fun right now, who knows. \n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I went along with the pursuits of my good friend who is talking to/ has a situation with another girl?

I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news.

I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see.

Hoping to get some insight, especially from couples who experienced similar situations and young professionals. \n\nMy SO and I are looking to move apartments. Currently our commutes are a blessing, 30 mins door to door max. While an ideal situation, lately my SO has been entertaining the idea of a new area that is at least an hour commute each way. \n\nFurther out we could afford a bigger, newer space with loads of amenities. Our money could go almost 25% further. He wants a home office where he can close the door and take important client meetings. He travels once a month for work and the area would be close to two major airports. \n\nI wouldn’t mind this in the least bit if we had a mortgage and kids, but as it stands now we are a young, childless couple renting while trying to save money for a down payment for a house. Money aside, my biggest concern is that 2hr/day commute which feels unnecessary and could even backfire on us. \n\nHis job is extremely stressful and time consuming. He will be traveling a lot. He’s already up to his eyeballs in work and will no doubt only get busier. Since I’m not making as much or stressed as much as he is, I naturally would take on more responsibilities around the house to ease his day and streamline our lives, like cleaning, cooking, chores and appointments, etc. \n\nI (at least in the foreseeable future) will not have the flexibility to work from home like he does. I work full time and, if we make this move, I will spend 2 hours commuting each day. Not only will I have to leave earlier in the morning, I will be coming home later. I’m looking for a higher paying position now that will no doubt be more time consuming, so it could mean I’ll be home an additional hour or two later every day. \n\nThe move so far out from work feels draining and unnecessary. I would prefer to be closer to work without the extra space and amenities and get home in time to make dinner and clean up, instead of coming home after a long day and a longer commute to cook and clean, only to do it all over again eight hours later. \n\nUltimately, I want to ease the weight of his job, but I feel like he doesn’t realize how a move this far out might backfire on us long term. The space would be super nice but the time and energy would be stretched thin. \n\nEventually when we do have a family and house 1hr+ out from work, by that time I’ll either be working part time or staying at home with the kids while they’re young. Again the commute is not the issue m, it’s the fact that I won’t be able to do as much as I want around the house to support our family without bleeding myself dry or relying on him to take on a large portion of the responsibilities. \n\nI also don’t want to sound like I’m trying to get out of an 1hr+ commute because I’m lazy or something. Or maybe I am being lazy, you guys tell me! I don’t have much real world experience and I’m sure I’m not the first or the last person to take on a longer commute.

TLDR at the end.\n\nI have this friend, John, whom I've been friends with for about 20 years. I talked with a mutual friend of ours, Tom, recently. Tom, who is also a current customer of mine (John brought him to the business) said that John had some sort of break down at his most recent job waiting tables. He kept oversleeping and was missing/coming in late for shifts, so he went on work disability for stress.\n\nTom said that John blames me for this because after all he did for the business, I forced him out as a partner. I didn't get into specifics with Tom, so I just told him it was either end the partnership or close the business down. Shutting down would cause my customers a good amount of harm because there's a chance they'd incur additional expenses with reconfiguring their current equipment. At the very least, it would be a pain in the ass to switch.\n\nI initially started this business with $40k of my own money. John had no money, but he promised to handle weekly system maintenance, and customer support. I would handle sales &amp; marketing and operations, and we would split onboarding new customers. At the right time, I would get my initial $40k back plus a reasonable % return based on profits. Everything else we would split 50/50 since we split the workload 50/50.\n\nJohn brought Tom and one other business as customers. I was going through a horrible divorce (to the point where my ex was filing false police reports in an effort to get full custody), and I wasn't bringing in new customers like I needed to. \n\nJohn floated the company anywhere from $20-$200 for several months to keep checks from bouncing. All told, his floats totaled about $4k. When I got back on track, I paid John back by giving him a bigger percentage of the fees we charged from onboarding new customers until he was square.\n\nWhile he was floating the company money, I noticed that John wasn't handling customer support or system maintenance. He wouldn't log into the system for weeks or months at a time, if at all. If customers contacted us for support, he immediately asked me for help. He would say he didn't know the system as well as I did, so after helping him (and the customer) I gave him the resources I studied to learn the system for him to study. He continued to ask me for help every time a customer called, and admitted he hadn't studied anything when I asked him. \n\nIt was a choice between enabling him and helping the customer or potentially losing business. Admittedly, I got upset with him after one incident in which he blew up my phone while I was meeting with a potential client. When I didn't answer, he called the client's office explaining that there was a support emergency and he needed me. He called right when I was explaining to said potential client how stable and reliable our systems were, and how we had enough personnel to handle any problems they had.\n\nAfter this incident, there were two or three other times where upset customers were calling me directly saying they had sent emails and left voicemail messages several days ago without a response. I would confront John about this, and he said he had responded and left messages, but they never got back to him. He would then immediately contact them with me present and tell the customer he left messages. The customer would then second-guess themselves, and John would end up handling the issue.\n\nAbout a year after I straightened out my personal issues and after he had been paid back, he was still slacking on his share of work. After another of these complaints, I checked the company email logs. The customer had sent an email that was forwarded to John. However, John had never responded. The only thing I couldn't tell was if John had called the customer or used his personal email address. I then checked the system, and maintenance hadn't been done at that point for about 9 months. I took screenshots and copied logs to document everything.\n\nI took him to lunch and brought up the subject, and I said that I felt like I was doing about 98% of the work but only getting paid 50%. It was taking time away from finding new business, and delaying getting my $40k plus return back as we agreed. John acknowledged I was doing the majority of the work and that he had been slacking, but he said that he floated the company when I was having personal problems. He also said (and I quote), \"And how about all of the customers I brought in?\"\n\nI reminded him that the company paid him back while I haven't gotten anything beyond distributions. I also said, \"You mean Customer A and Customer B? One who's your best friend from high school?\" I then proposed two options. 1) we end the partnership now, become competitors, and keep the customers we each brought on. 2) I temporarily take an 80% share, and give back 5% per month to him for every month that he meets work milestones. He could even start the milestone list and be in charge of editing it until we finally agreed on it.\n\nJohn proceeded to comment that both choices were unfair, and countered with me getting 60%. I said to John that since he acknowledged I was doing about 98% of the work, did he honestly think that I should only get 60% of the profits, and would he agree to that if the roles were reversed? He then said he was only agreeing to option 2 out of our friendship. I wrote up an agreement, we both signed it, and he promised to get the milestone list together in a week.\n\nTwo months later, after asking multiple times for the milestone list, and John either saying \"next week\" or not responding, I got a call from our biggest customer. They had called and emailed three days in a row and nobody returned their call. They called because their service was not working consistently, but now it wasn't working at all. I logged into the system and saw the problem. The particular server's script that clears cache files stopped working, and disk space was almost out. Deleted the cache, rebooted the system, customer's working again.\n\nI checked the system logfiles, and John hadn't logged into the system one time since we switched to the 80/20 agreement. I immediately texted him to call me regarding something urgent about our biggest customer. He called me the next day.\n\nI told him what happened with our customer and that I handled it. He expressed relief and said, \"I wish they had called sooner.\" I said, \"speaking of which, I have something to show you.\" I texted him the screenshots of the system logs, email logs, and call logs, and the list of cache files on the server. I explained that this was what the problem was, and luckily, it was a quick fix. John then said that he couldn't see exactly what caused the problem.\n\nI said that he hadn't logged into the system in over two months. I also said that log screenshots showed that the customer had called and emailed, but they got no response. It also showed that the calls forwarded to his phone. I then said that things weren't working out, and we can't be business partners anymore. If he wanted the business he needed to buy me out of my $40k plus 80%, or I could cut a check for his 20% share so he'd be out. Either way, he needed to decide in 7 days, or I would hire an attorney to figure it all out. I said that I hoped we could still be friends, but I would understand if he didn't want that. John gets very upset, says some words that I don't remember, and hangs up on me.\n\nHe texted me the next day saying he was giving up his 20%, and he didn't want any money. He said he valued friendship over the business, unlike me, and that this was all my plan to steal the business from him.\n\nI saved the texts until I sent him an agreement to relinquish his shares and he signed it. Recently, John texted me randomly, saying that he couldn't believe how I could do this to his friend and how he stuck by my side. I said that I felt the same about him: how could a friend promise to do his share of the business but not do any of it? He then responded that I was a dick. I deleted the texts and blocked his number because fuck him.\n\nTLDR: I invest $40k to start a business, close friend invests $0 but promises to do half the work plus allow me to get back my $40k plus return. He floats the company about $4k while I go through personal problems, but stops doing his share of the work even when he gets paid back. I confront him the first time and he agrees to a 20% share, but still doesn't step up to do work. We almost lose our biggest customer, I confront him again and end the partnership. He calls me a dick.",

My mom and I talked about it in private since she doesn't really understand Twitter and how it works. I told my mom that, yeah we should talk to her about being careful about what she says, especially on the internet but to not worry because when you're in middle school you think cussing makes you \"cool\". I reminded her that I did it as well on my \"fan account\" on twitter and that was she said wasn't even bad. My sister's account didn't have her picture or name on it, if that's an important factor. It wasn't an urgent matter so we didn't address it right away although we obviously planned to. Literally 2 hours after she texted my mom, my cousin decided it was her place to call my sister and lecture her over the phone.

However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations.

I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers.

            "input": "A few years ago I lived with this girl that had a rescue dog that she had adopted a few years before. The dog was super sweet and super clingy and loved humans. Sadly she did not have a lot of time for him, so she never walked him, saying that he was too old, which I think is complete BS. He only went out in the small backyard to do his business. He spent all his day in the living room waiting for someone to come home and play with him. He also had a lot of energy and was not properly trained, which led to him chomping on everything he could reach. We were advised when we moved into the house that he does this, so I did my best to always keep food out of the dog's reach. He still got into some of my friend's chocolate one time and had to go to the vet. \n\nNow, one thing that bothered me about living with this girl was the fact that she was not very tidy or clean. It was an awkward situation, since the house belonged to the girl's father and was already stuffed with the girl's and her boyfriend's belongings. They owned a lot of toys from TV shows and such and generally their stuff was just everywhere, while I barely ever had a place to put my laptop. \n\nOne time after christmas, I wanted to sit at the dining table to eat and discovered that it was covered in stuff, some of them wrapped presents. I decided to put the presents on one of the chairs, so I could eat at the table. Later in the day, the dog's owner calls me downstairs to inform me that the dog had gotten into the presents and eaten a scented candle and that this was a gift from her parents to her boyfriend's parents and that the candle had to be replaced...by me. Not only did she want me to pay for the candle, which is still annoying enough but whatever, but she wanted me to personally go out right then and shop for the candle, as it had to be there the next day. I was honestly shocked that she wanted me to go buy this candle. For one, she did not know what was in the presents, so she did not put a note on it saying that it might be something edible. Also, I did not feel that it was my responsibilty to replace an item that her dog ate and it is not like she replaced my friend's chocolate when the dog jumped on the counter and ate those and I would've never asked her to because it's ridiculous. Ultimately, I only had two more months living with them though, so I did go shopping for the candle, which of course was a christmas-scented candle and was now out of stock. I bought a similar candle, which the housemate said she couldn't use and offered me to keep it. How generous.\n\nSo AITA for initially not wanting to replace the candle and still feeling annoyed at this girl for this? I wouldn't have done it, but my parents convinced me to just try and keep the peace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR my housemate's dog ate a candle that I had moved from a table to a chair and my housemate wanted me to shop for the exact candle and when I bought a similiar one from the same brand didn't want it.

I asked her if she had an e-mail or knew who I could contact, and she provided that information.  So I e-mailed them and got a call a couple of days later to schedule an interview.\n\nShe asked if I told this person that I got his e-mail from her.  I didn't.  He said it was his personal e-mail and he wasn't sure how I got it, \\*but\\* he didn't ask AND I didn't tell.  He just proceeded to tell me about the position, and how they are hiring for all positions (FT/PT/PRN) at the moment.  He told my friend (when she interviewed over a week ago) that they weren't hiring anyone else.  Well, my friend spoke to this contact person today because apparently, she has not yet given them their decision on whether or not she accepts.  She is still waiting to hear back from another place that is basically her dream job, and asked if she could have until Monday or Tuesday.  Well, I guess this person sounded a little irritated and wants her decision by today.  Personally, I don't think this has anything to do with me, because she \\*has an offer\\*, and I don't.  I still need to interview.  \n\nShe said I should have waited, blah blah blah, I thought you were my friend, and didn't think I would have e-mailed them so quickly.  But see...she could have told me to wait, or not give me the e-mail at all, and I would have respected that!  I also saw this position on Indeed some time ago, but when I found out she applied and was in the process of scheduling an interview, I held off, out of respect to her as a friend because I knew she was desperately looking for a job and I have one.  I told her I would wait to contact them until after she got an offer.  Well, she got an offer, so I thought it was okay for me to go ahead and proceed.\n\nIt's not like I'm stealing this position away from her.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now and there have been a string of issues that make me feel like or relationship will only ever be temporary.  This is mostly due to her sexual views which contrast mine.  She is much more open to sex but stays monogamous to me since I am less liberal about it.  She has made clear though that if we are separated, she still needs physical contact.  Which brings me to the incident...\n\nLast summer we were separated for 2 months due to working in different places.  We agreed before hand that if she did anything with someone else, we would follow boundaries and she'd tell me beforehand.  She did not do anything for 7 weeks but then at a party, she got cuddly with a co-worker and they ended up exchanging oral.  Pretty much they cuddled, he fingered her and she blew him.  Though this bothered me immensely, what hurt me the most was that I was trying to contact her through the party and she never responded until afterwards when she told me she did this with another guy.  It was honestly the worst I've ever felt.\n\nWe talked about it and she claimed she didn't consider it sex so she didn't know she should have checked up with me.  But what bothered me was she was outright ignoring me and I saw it as an act of cheating.  However I buried these insecurities and have been with her for another 4 months with no problems.\n\nBut I still think about this a lot and I could never see myself spending my life with her because of it.  There's a chance we'll be separated again this summer and I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to give her the option of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up.  Maybe I'm looking for more general advice but I could only think of this sub.  Thanks for the feedback.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend did something id consider cheating.

I don’t have much else to reciprocate and it felt kind of weird that she was doing that and expecting something out of me. \n\nShe also thinks I’m rude for asking her this straight up instead of just hinting at it or making a joke about it like “clean up the dishes would ya?” To keep it light hearted or whatever.

Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this.

This filmmaker posts an ad for extras for his viking movie, and he posted it to our Facebook group. The compensation was snacks, and you had to bring your own garb and submit pics of you in it for consideration. He was also stupidly having men in Viking garb, and women in French high middle ages garb for \\*reasons\\*.\n\nI have worked in payroll for 10 years, and I'm very familiar with the FLSA (US law that regulates minimum wage, contractor/exempt/non-exempt employee status, and overtime pay). I even looked at the SAG requirements to make sure that movies were not an exception to FLSA (they aren't). I then spend the entire fucking day arguing that what he was doing was illegal. Somehow, I was \"killing his art\" and \"ruining his chances to make it in films\" and \"shitting on independent filmmaker who don't have the money of big studios\".\n\nI replied that he should fund raise to get the capital to keep up with his legal requirements. That the film company (because yes, it was a company that received pay for work) could get a loan from a bank. Or they could do a GoFundMe, or something other than wage theft. But of course, I'm the asshole for caring about the artists getting fair compensation for their art, but not about his art.  He was incredibly rude to me in front of my community.  When I reached out to his film company to inform them that what they were doing was illegal, I was rudely mocked and then blocked.\n\nSo, what he is doing is illegal.  The film company is being hypocritical, because they charge for doing film work like advertising and commercials, but they aren't compensating their extras.  I am a huge fan of the arts, and actively support my local arts scene.  But I'm also very much a fan of workers rights, and I happen to think that if your art relies on fucking over other artists than you don't deserve to \"make it\" in the business.

They were always the quiet type, especially when I saw them at school around other people.\n\nI send them a text saying \"Looks like fun haha\", a couple hours later they reply with gibberish. I ask what they said and they just reply \"I'm so drunk\", and a picture of alcohol on a table. All I reply is \"that's probably not the smartest thing you could have done.\" \n\nThe next morning they ask what I meant. I just said that them getting drunk, especially at their age (16), isn't the smartest thing you could do. Automatically they got defensive, saying they had a good time and that they were with friends. They said that the alcohol let them unwind and have a good time.\n\nI reply saying that it's good they had a good time, but alcohol shouldn't be the reason you had fun, and that they did something that they wouldn't do normally while sober. We basically went back and forth for an hour or so, them justifying it because they had fun, and me just saying it wasn't a smart thing.\n\nMultiple times throughout the argument, they'd say \"can we just ignore this\", but then they would try to get the last word in, usually along the lines of \"I'm still going to drink I don't care what you say,\" to which I'd respond to and start the argument again. It then evolved to them telling me that I was taking the easy way through life by going to college. Eventually, I had enough, and said that we should apologize to each other, and they said they had nothing to apologize for. I left it at that, and it's been months since we last spoke.\n\nI never, throughout that entire conversation, say \"you should not, or can not drink.\" All I said was \"it wasn't a smart thing to do\". It was simply just advice. I don't care if people drink, but it was just a mixture of their age as well as how they acted that worried me. They were with friends and they didn't drive home, and they assured me that they'd only drink around people they knew.\n\nWas I out of line? I felt it wasn't really my business, and I sort of knew this person was stubborn, so telling them anything would probably not be effective anyways.

I'm a university student living with my boyfriend of four years in a small apartment, with two small rescue dogs. We don't have a whole lot of money, but we can live comfortably as long as we don't waste our money. Because of this, when me and my partner decided to get a dog last year, we chose adoption over buying a puppy (there were a few reasons along with money, such as wanting to rehome an unfortunate dog and also, we wanted to have a slightly older dog that was more adjusted to kids). We went to the shelter and found two beautiful boston terrier girls. They are both two years old and sisters, like my daughters were at the time, they had been around kids in their first home and really seemed perfect, so we got both of them. They are amazing and we love them so much, the kids love them and the dogs are really well behaved. \n\nBecause we have a two bedroom apartment and not a whole lot of space/money, my boyfriend and I donated and sold the baby clothes as the girls grew out of them, keeping only the sentimental pieces. However, we fell a little bit behind somewhere and ended up sorting through quite a lot of 0-6 month clothes that we left at the back of a closet. Now, my sister in law has recently found out she's pregnant. Her and her husband are really well off and had a son a few years ago who was dressed head to toe in designer clothes from birth. I didn't think they'd struggle for clothes. My boyfriend suggested we could give the clothes to his sister when she found out she's pregnant at a family meal, where my SIL was in attendance, but everyone sort of laughed it off so I thought nothing more about it. \n\nFast forward a month or so, we finally get round to sorting the baby clothes. My husband and I had bought the dogs some matching sweaters setting us back £20, so I had the grand idea to start cutting and sewing the clothes into dog sweaters and onesies for them to sleep in through the winter. My boyfriend thought this was a great idea, the girls loved seeing the dogs in their old clothes and it was super cute. I posted pics of them on instagram, and basically got a snarky text from my sister in law about how she'd have to be buying a new wardrobe then. I took it as a joke, and sent her a few more pictures of the dogs thinking she was being silly, and she kicked off. MIL started kicking off too. Next thing I know, my SIL is posting on Facebook marketplace asking for cheap/free baby clothes. \n\nSo, AITA for assuming my SIL would buy her own baby clothes when she didn't seem too pleased to have mine/dressed her first baby fully designer? As far as I know they haven't had a change in income, but am I wrong for assuming?",

Toward the end of my 3 yrs there she started going through a mid life crisis and became a bit of an entitled twat. Boss's mom worked there as well and I LOVED this little old woman like she was my 2nd grandma. She is literally the only reason I would still visit the store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently the little old lady had a heart attack. She's had her surgery and is in recovery. I am super relieved by this. The manager asked for several days if I would come back because the boss and her mom were both out due to this. I always said I had other plans. Not lying I legit have tests for autism coming up and am trying to get an appointment for possible skin cancer tests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday she sounded extremely desperate. Said she would let me come in whenever I wanted, that it was only temporary, that things were royally fucked and they NEEDED some serious help. I agreed to come in and talk about it tomorrow.

I also know it would make little old lady's recovery less stressful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo things are very concerning to me. One is that she would not discuss why things were so fucked beyond reason and Two is she would not discuss how I would be paid or how much. If they are I am going to insist it's in writing or I walk. I know that's probably an asshole move, but not why I'm writing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto the thing that I feel like makes me an asshole. I want to limit this temporary work if anything. I can't decided between 2 weeks or 1 month. I know that the recovery time for a triple bypass is 3 months and it's getting close to summer meaning they'll be SUPER BUSY. I know I should do the full 3 months to help out.

I told her how I felt I was being shut out, and how it reminded me of when I was bullied throughout school.  She told me that she was upset that I didn’t seem to care enough about her illness.  I made it clear that it was painful for me to see her getting close to Y and Z without me.  I had found out later that on previous occasions when they had met up that and suggested inviting me along,  X had said ‘she’s busy on that day’ or ‘she wouldn’t like that’.  Never was I even asked.  I also found out that X had lied about cancelling a night out with me under the pretence of having to work, but she went out with Z instead.  It was only when Z posted on Facebook that I found out.  X said work had been cancelled.  Later, Z told me (inadvertently) there had never been work – X just wanted to go out with Z instead.  I know that X has lied to others about such things because I’ve witnessed it.\nThings are going on as before.  X is still meeting up with my friends and family and never asked me, even though she has promised she would least sometimes.  It happened this weekend and it was just too much.  I now don’t want anything to do with her.  I’ll be polite when we cross paths but I have no interest in being a friend any longer. X has managed to convince everyone that she is the ‘victim’ here because she is ill and needs special treatment, and I’m the bad guy for not giving it to her.  Some people even tell me that I’m over-reacting because of my mental issues.  It’s painful and isolating.\n\n",

The way she acted around me was always a little off, and Jim definitely noticed too. But after Jim moved, things started to get...weird. It started when she made a passing comments about how she would date me or how attractive she thought I was. I didn't think much of it at first, because she's an inordinately nice person, and I figured she was just trying to raise my spirits after my past relationship. Because we're good friends, we message each a lot, and she always tells me how I'm pretty much her closest friend. The second to last time we hung out, we were watching a movie, and she decided to lean up to me and cuddle. Well, no big deal, I figured-after all, I think two friends can cuddle without it being sexual, and have with other female friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell at this point its pretty obvious that some sexual tension was building. The last time I hung out with her, we both got *extremely* drunk. She made some comments about how hard she was trying to not make out with me or take things further. Now, even in my borderline black-out levels of drunkenness, I had zero intention of taking things further, as I believe that would be incredibly scummy and immoral. However, by the end of the night we ended up cuddling in bed together-and I mean *really* cuddling. In the morning when I sobered up, I felt really bad about the whole situation. I thought i made that pretty clear, but she has a habit of not talking about these kinda things and acting like nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell a couple days ago, Jim was talking to me and told me that Ashley had \"a thing\" with another close friend of ours (this one we'll call Bob). All I really know is that she spent two nights over at Bob's house, and he then later texted Jim and told him that he \"didn't want to go behind his back\" and that he and Ashley were planning on having \"a thing\". Neither Jim nor I were fully sure on what he meant by that, but he didn't want me to talk to her about it, as he doesn't want her to know he told me and didn't keep it between him and Bob. He said he was OK with it but that he didn't understand why Bob would be OK with it. While I'm almost positive that they did not have sex, I am 100% sure that some wicked intense cuddling was happening, and maybe some slightly sexual stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAshley never told me about any of this, and obviously has no intention to. Oddly enough, I feel used and cheap. Maybe I shouldn't, but I feel like she was kinda toying with me. I'm a pretty emotional person, so suppose I felt like we just had developed a closer bond, and the fact that she does shit with Bob  within the a month kinda hurts. She wont tell me about it because she knows it will hurt me. While I had no intention of trying things with her, the fact that she would do all this weird flirty stuff with me, not really talk about it, and then spend two nights at one of my close friend's house doing god knows what makes me feel used. I don't want to paint her in a bad light, though, as we are extremely close, and she has never been anything but overtly nice to me, and I have confided things to her that I would never  tell anyone else. That being said, with this whole situation, I told her that I no longer want to hang out with her 1 on 1, and I really don't feel like speaking to her at the moment. I know that I said earlier that two people can cuddle without it being sexual, but this whole situation with Bob feels off to me. Idk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling used and being mad at her?",

My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now.

Yesterday I got really really sick (maybe food poisoning) and I felt terrible. The whole World was spinning, my stomach fighting itself, my legs were cramping and there was not enough air for my desperate lungs. At first my boyfriend tried his best to help me. Did hold my hair while I kissed the toilet and gave me something to Drink. He is really afraid of me getting pregnant and insisted on me taking my birth control pill while still vomiting. So I of course threw asap up end sent it on a journey through the toilet System. At this Moment I was just shaking and was almost not able to get back to bed. Two hours later (I finally Was able to sleep and escape my pain!), he woke me up and told me to take my pill again, because He read, tagt this is the thing to do. And here is the Part where I really fucked up: I forgot to take an extra blister! So there is no way I can take another one, it is 1 am and we are in the middle of nowhere without a pharmacy. And He got mad, so so mad at me. And I can totally understand that but I am still shaking in agony and throwing up again (so I really doubt that I would be able to even keep the second pill). And He is screaming at me and insulting me and taking away the pillow He gave me, so I can sit up a little (way better for my stupid still Wrestling tummy) and pushing me out of the way (not so great for my stupid stomach). I tried to calm him down (I am at the end of my zyclus and we did not have Sex very often and the only time where something could have happened is two days ago and He did not even Come into me - I know that that is not a safe method, that's why I am taking birth control pills, but just to calm him down a little and I am still feeling sooooooo Bad). I started crying cause it was all to much and begged him to just be a little nicer to me and help me and maybe hug me, because I really could not bare it any longer. He did nothing of that. I spend the whole night shaking and wishing to Die, while He ignored me and sometimes even pushed me, when I came too close to him.\n\nAnd here we are, the day after sitting in front of the only pharmacy and waiting for it too open. The pharmacist told us Over the phone that there is no reason to be concerned, that I just can take the pill after, but she will not open till 11 am (we are sitting here since 7:30). I can totally (totally totally) understand why He is so angry but I feel like He left me alone when I really needed him and I do not know at that moment, how I will ever be able to forgive him. ",

We were both really goofy and got along well.  My friend had a rabbit called Boingo. At the beginning of 5th grade, her family was going on a trip to Hawaii and needed someone to babysit their rabbit, so they asked our family and we accepted.  So for two weeks we took care of the rabbit, which was super fun. She and her family were really thankful.\n\nA little bit further into the year, she brought Boingo to our class for a visit, because elementary kids love rabbits. It was a pretty big hit.\n\nNow the actual event.  At the end of the year, our teacher organized a big party for the last full day of school.  One of the things we were going to do was a bingo game where all the things on our boards were our favorite events from the year.  We spent the day before coming up with ideas, and of course Boingo's visit was one of them.  There were a lot of choices to put on our board and I didn't really want to decide (we made our own boards), so I just went down the list on the whiteboard and put every other one on my board.  In the process, I missed Boingo. \n\nSo we play our bingo game and our teacher calls out Boingo.  My friend was sitting next to me and noticed I don't mark anything, and gets really upset.    She starts saying things like \"How could you forget Boingo?!\", \"You babysat him!\" and \"You should have put Boingo on your board!\". I realized I may have made a mistake and profusely apologized, and tried to explain how I chose what to put on my board, so it was an accident.  But she wouldn't even hear it.  She blamed me personally for not putting Boingo.  \n\nThere's two things I remember about this.  One is I became so upset I started crying, but she didn't even care.  The second is what she said after I kept trying to tell her it was an accident. \"You should know not to argue with a girl, because they'll always be right\"\n\nTo this day, she made me feel like such an asshole for not remembering something significant to me and her, even though I feel it was just an accident and shouldn't have been a big deal.

I realized much later that her personal Instagram account was no longer following mine (no idea when it happened), but her “cats’ account” was still following mine. I told the mutual friend about this, only to be told the 'unfollowing' could've been accidental, and that I might be overthinking things. At some point I came to a conclusion that the mutual friend probably knows something was up, but just didn't want to escalate matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a passive introvert, I stopped initiating communication after attempts in the group chat got zero reciprocation from her.

The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like “that’s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been”\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn’t like that I’d used the word “obviously” because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn’t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn’t know it was that obvious, and it hadn’t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word “obviously” can be offensive, but I don’t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word “obviously” was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said “I don’t care.” She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don’t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe’s waiting for me to apologize, but I don’t think I should have to. I just don’t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn’t be offended if she said something similar to me.

He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?",

            "input": "Hubby and I moved across the country to help my mom with my grandparents (shopping, doctor visits, etc). My grandmother has alzheimer's and it's still in the beginning stages, which makes dealing with her a little difficult. She's in her late 70s and refuses to be told how to live, even if it's good for her health. Because of insurance changed, we have had to change their doctor a couple of times. Her last three doctors have told her that she's diabetic, but she refuses to believe it and continually sites the doctor before them saying she's \"borderline\" only. She's actually gotten into full blown arguments with my grandfather, my mother, and myself about the fact that she has to take her medication as prescribed and the fact that her diet absolutely has to change in order to keep her healthy. I have even gone so far as to threaten her with a home (not that I could ever follow through with the threat, I was just grasping at straws). My grandfather is and has been ready to be put in a home for over a decade because he does not want to become a burden to anyone. My grandmother, on the other hand, refused to talk to me for almost two weeks just for mentioning it. Then, about eight months ago, a friend of my grandmother's moved back into town (she had been living with her son and hated it). She's on the list for section 8 housing, but jumped the gun and moved into my grandparents' house. From what my grandfather was told, she would be there two weeks, she was there three months and only left because she had to (my uncle was coming into town and my grandfather told her that they needed the space). She still takes my grandmother out all the time, and while they are out she borrows money from my grandmother with no real repayment plan in place. She also comes over a few times a week to eat dinner, completely uninvited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomewhere in the mix of all that (about three months ago), my grandmother started calling on her friend to take her to the doctor. I would show up to take her to appointments only to find out that she was already gone. Or I would find out, after the fact, about her going to an appointment that I didn't even know about. This is especially problematic because her friend doesn't tell us what's happening and my grandmother doesn't remember everything or just refuses to tell us about her appointments. When my mother confronted my grandparents about it, they responded by saying that I'm unreliable. Which blows my mind because until this started happening, I was always the one taking them to their appointments without fail, and I am still the one that takes my grandfather to all of his appointments. Of course, asking them how I can be considered unreliable when I don't even know about the appointment gets met with silence. So, we've officially told my grandmother that she is no longer allowed to go to the doctor without me or my mother, on at least four separate times now. I even went so far as to call her friend and tell her that she cannot take my grandmother to any appointments. Like, I don't even care if you take her shopping or whatever. That's between you and her, but no more doctors. That's my job. That was two weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week, my grandmother had outpatient surgery. Her friend went with us because my grandmother had no idea where she was supposed to go and I wasn't involved in any of the planning for this surgery. There was a mass removed, which had to be sent to pathology. I set up the appointment for the results. I also set up an appointment for my grandfather's dermatologist later on the same day. That day is Monday. I woke up sick as a dog on Friday, but I have been forcing medication down my throat to get myself well enough over the weekend to not have to ask my mom to take time off work for this. Well, midday on Friday, grandma's friend calls me.  \n\n\nFriend: Hey \\[my name\\]. I heard you had to go to the Social Security Office on Monday?\n\nMe: No...?\n\nFriend: Oh, well, your grandmother's appointment is on Monday. At what time?\n\nMe: Why?\n\nFriend: So that I can go.\n\nMe: Why?\n\nFriend: \\*mumbles\\* Okay. Okay. Talk to you later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother comes home later on, from being with my grandparents. She caught my grandma attempting to make plans with her friend for Monday. Her excuse is that I'm sick and I won't be able to take her. I'm at the point where I want to call her friend and reiterate that she is not to take my grandmother to the doctors anymore.

Leash law is in the surrounding area outside the property as well as mandatory in the complex. \nLast August someone moved down the hall from us with a lab puppy. No biggie, it was a small puppy and they had it off leash every now and then. He was just a little chonk so no harm, I suppose. \n\nHowever, now he is almost a fully grown dog and I'd guess around 80 pounds. It's pretty much daily that he's off leash and running around the apartment with my neighbor. My neighbor relies on an electric collar to make his dog behave, which works only after he's repeatedly called him and shocked him multiple times.\n\nTo avoid problems, I try to time when I go out with my dogs bc I don't want to be caught on the stairs/in the hallway at the same time with mine and his dog, but we've had run-ins before where I quickly have to duck away with mine.\n I'm not going to act like my dogs are perfect, one is reactive but I'm working on him. The other is pretty okay with other dogs as long as they don't invade her space. Even so, they are always on leash so I can control them, unlike my neighbor who relies on his dog listening to him and his collar.\n\nI contacted the front office (last October) about this happening and they told me to take a picture of them and email it. At this point, I've emailed them over a dozen times and I believe they have fined him once but it hasn't changed this problem.\n\nTonight we had a run-in and his dog was very close to mine. He finally got his dog away after shocking it a few times.

He acted like a fool in public, yelling obscenities even on public transportation. At first, it was a minor inconvenience, but after time it started to wear on me.

I was in a bad situation where myself and my two cats were about to become homeless. \nSo me and my boyfriend (we can call him bob) were only really dating for about a month. We got along fairly well but obviously there's only so much you can do with someone long distance. Anyways, when I told him about my situation, he offered to fly me to him, with my cats and I could stay in his second bedroom (or with him in his bed if I decided). He was going to pay for plane ticket, pet deposit fees, etc. Until I could get back on my feet financially and such. He even said he'd fly me back home if so desired. \nI didn't really want to accept such a big offer like that, especially since I hadn't been with him for very long.. but I was put in a position where it really was my best option. So I accepted.\nMy first week there, things were weird. He would not have sex with me, or anything intimate. I tried to sleep in his bed but every day he'd say that it felt like I was pushing him away. So much so, he felt I was doing it in my sleep. (Creating physical barriers between us using a blanket?) \nA few more weeks go by, I still haven't been able to find a job in the small town I moved to. Therefore I haven't been able to help pay for anything, but he did know this beforehand. After 2 months, I finally get a part time serving job. I make enough to pay half the bills but not reimburse him for what he's already paid.. and he reassured me he doesn't want me to pay him back. He also had put me on the lease, too.\n After starting my new job and spending time away from him, I realized how much we didn't get along. We could not communicate in a productive way at all. When I started to show a lack of interest, he immediately assumed I was cheating. He began to go through messages of mine if I left them open on my computer. \nI finally decided I wanted it to be over because nothing about this was healthy or normal for a relationship, but I didn't have anywhere else to go so I thought maybe I could stay. I wanted to be friends with him since he did so much for me but i also didnt want to be pressured to stay in a relationship. I wanted to stay in the second bedroom, continue to pay half rent. At least until I could save and afford my own place. He told me that if I didn't want to date him, then I had to move out. I was disappointed but obliged. Started to look for a new place, staying in the second bedroom (Where I had nothing but a twinsize blow up mattress and about 80% of the room filled with Bob's boxes). Since I was single and so ready for this relationship to be over, especially after 3 months of no sex, I was flirting with a guy at work via texts. Bob found a friend to help him hack into all of my accounts and cell phone number so that he could read all of my messages. He showed up to my work multiple times to yell at me in front of customers to \"get my shit and get out\". I had to have my manager escort him out because he would not leave. He simultaneously changed the locks on the front door so I couldn't get in. He would call his mom over to babysit me whenever I was home alone so I didn't \"steal anything\". When I finally moved out (onto a work friends couch) he refuses to give me the rent money I paid for THIS month, and is telling me to repay him for everything he spent before...\n\ntldr; long distance boyfriend pays for my plane ticket to live with him while I'm broke and homeless, when relationship doesn't work out, he hacks into my accounts and messages, changes locks on door, and accuses me of lying and cheating and kicks me out even though I am on lease and pay half the bills.

Also I'm on the mobile app and apparently that fucks with formatting, so apologies if this post looks a little bit wonky. Sorry if this gets long but y'all are gonna need a bit of backstory for context and I have a real issue with rambling. \n\nI met my now ex-girlfriend at school when we were 14. We were best friends for a year before we began dating and then were together for about six years. I'm 22 now and we've been broken up for a little over six months. I find it easier to tell a story with names so we'll call my ex Jessica. \n\nThe year that we were friends was great. We were both kind of \"emo kids\" and, being that we lived kind of in the middle of nowhere and there weren't any other emos at our school, we kinda naturally drifted towards each other. She was a kind, sweet girl at first - very bubbly, always smiling, always friendly to everybody. She could be a little hyperactive at times, but I'm incredibly laid back and  a bit shy so we kinda  balanced each other's energy perfectly. We'd hang out at each other's houses almost every night after school and play video games, or go walk around the local park if the weather was nicer. I awkwardly asked her out on Valentine's Day of 2012, thinking I was being dead romantic. Still one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \n\nShe started to change pretty soon after we started dating. She'd always been semi-jealous when it came to me, even when we were just friends. Think, if anyone else called me their best friend she'd get on their arse like \"actually sweetie he's *MY* best friend but nice try :)\" or she'd sulk a little if I made plans with other friends and didn't invite her. I'd always found it endearing, I guess because I was never the one getting chewed out. Boy did that change when we started dating! If I so much as spoke to another girl to ask her for the homework for some class, Jessica would get angry with me and demand to know who she was and what we were talking about. I did confront her about it a couple months into the relationship and she cried and told me she was super scared of being cheated on because she'd seen her dad do it to her mum her whole life and said she was sorry. At the time I thought that was reasonable, said alright and tried to move past it. \n\nThe jealousy didn't stop. In fact, it only continued to escalate. When we were 16 she, without my knowing or my consent, went through my Facebook friends and Instagram followers and blocked any girls I wasn't related to. When we were 18 we started renting a flat together and she threatened one of our neighbours to \"keep the fuck away from me\" because she brought over cookies as a welcome gift while Jessica was out. That same year when I came out as bisexual, she told me that she didn't want me hanging out with my best friend since childhood because he was gay and she was afraid of any \"funny business\" going on. It reached a point where she wouldn't even let me go to the hairdresser's because the only one in our town had three women and a gay guy working there and she didn't want any of them touching me. She also repeatedly called my workplace saying I needed to come home because there was an emergency if she knew I was on a shift with all female co-workers (which was often) resulting in me eventually being sacked. \n\nHonestly, if it was just the intense jealousy, I might have been able to cope, or try to salvage some semblance of a relationship with her. But she would also insult me constantly. I'm pretty prone to eczema and she'd make fun of me if I had a breakout of it on my face. She mocked me when I lost my job and she became the breadwinner of the house. She'd either tease me or get incredibly angry with me if I ever cried about anything (I'm a sucker for crying at films). I gained a little weight around 19 when I had an injury and could no longer go to the gym and she called me fat relentlessly (in hindsight, I really wasn't fat at all), which I believe was one of the catalysts to me developing bulimia. All in all it was a shitty, emotionally abusive situation and I should've gotten out of it sooner than I did. \n\nI eventually broke it off because she started to become physically and sexually violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life one night. I'm now staying with my aforementioned childhood best friend and his husband, have a new job, am in recovery for my eating disorder and am well on the way to getting back on my feet. To be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole because of what happened in the relationship because I've come to accept that I was a victim and none of it was my fault. \n\nHowever. A \"friend of Jessica's\" recently reached out to me to let me know that Jess has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and is recieving treatment for it. My response was basically \"ah that sucks for her and I'm glad she's getting treatment but what's that to do with me?\"  What eventually transpired was that I was not speaking to her friend, but in fact Jessica herself through her friend's account, and that I was expected to forgive everything she did because of her diagnosis. I flat out refused because, while I'm no means an expert on personality disorders and do understand that they can make people act irrationally, I don't believe they're an excuse for outright abusive behaviours. Since I refused to forgive her, I've had countless messages from her, from mutual friends, and even from her mother which all essentially boil down to \"she can't help being an abusive person, you're being awful for not forgiving her.\" I'll note here she hasn't actually *apologised*, just incessantly asked me to \"forgive and forget\", \"get over it\" and even to give her a second chance. I'm starting to doubt that I'm doing the right thing by refusing to accept her BPD as an excuse. AITA and should I forgive her? \n\nTL;DR: my ex was incredibly abusive when we were together and has since been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which she's using to try and justify her behaviours without actually apologising. I refuse to accept it as an excuse and she, her mother and our mutual friends are telling me I'm the asshole for not forgiving her. \n",

Bear with me, this might get long but I'll try to only post the facts. \n\nAbout a year ago a girl I knew in high school (almost 15 years ago) friended me on Facebook. We only kind of knew each other through a school club but I figured sure, I'll add her. She started messaging me occasionally and it was nice to catch up, but I still consider us more of acquaintances than real friends.\n\nThis girl has a lot of drama. Her husband has lupus, she's got a myriad of medical issues (supposedly), she's constantly in-between jobs. At one point last year, shortly after I friended her on social media, she was doing a fund-raiser for something medical for her husband. Since I allot about $200 a month for charitable giving, I sent it to her, anonymously. I figured I could give money to someone in need that month instead of my usual organizations and yay, good karma and all that. (I also pointed her in the direction of state and government assistance programs, but IDK if she ever looked at them.)\n\nBut somehow she found out it was me. Since then, once or twice a month, she's asking me for money. Her furnace broke. She needs money to buy wood for their fireplace. She is in debilitating pain and her insurance doesn't cover the bills. She just needs $35 to cover food for the week or she won't be able to eat. Her car broke down. They sold their house in Texas and moved to Wyoming (who *does* that?) and the new house has more problems than they realized. You get the idea. At one point she even asked for like $2500 in startup capital for a bakery she plans to open...\n\nShe always promises she'll pay me back. I'm not that stupid. But since I already plan to spend $200 each month helping others, at first I figured it wasn't a big deal. Lately, however, I'm starting to think that it's just enabling her. The last time she asked for money I told her that $50 was all I could give her and that I can't be her ATM or bank, because even little amounts add up and I have my own family and kids to take care of. I told her I'm seriously done after this, that I wished her the best but I'm tapped out financially and emotionally and I'm just done.\n\nWell, guess who just got a message. She only needs $80 this time because she hasn't slept in 2 weeks and her husband is keeping her up because he's in pain and his disability check hasn't come in... I'm just so over it.

I really enjoy cooking, so I'd often treat the guys to a big meal once every 2 weeks or so where everyone would pitch in and I'd cook the main course. This was the norm for the fall, but now 2 of my roommates Aaron and Stan (fake names) are on a diet and prefer going out every week for an expensive cheat meal. I was happy that I didn't have to plan a week ahead, but also sad that I couldn't cook for anyone but myself anymore. This past week I go up to Aaron and Stan and ask to make them a cheat meal, and they agree on my idea for mac &amp; cheese. I ask if I can make it a dinner party and invite some of my friends and they agree with that as well, making the total amount of people about 12.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAaron lets me know that he and Stan are more concerned about their meal and doesn't want to pay for everyone else's food. Understandable, since it was my idea to invite everyone. I ask him how much he thinks he and Stan will eat and he says 2lbs each. Using how much I've eaten in the past and how much Aaron and Stan will eat, I get what I think will enough pasta and cheese to satisfy everyone, which was about $50 worth and I get reimbursed by Aaron and Stan $10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets weird. Aaron demands that he grate the cheese, not because he's especially good at it but because he missed his arm workout that day. I hand him the cheese and the grater and let him do whatever. Aaron takes the cheese and starts aggressively grating this cheese. Like, he's screaming and looks like he's trying to fist the plate into submission. After one poor, poor pound of cheese he moves onto the next one. I take the cheese and take a look at it before I dump it in the pot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are few tiny, red specks in there.\n\nHe cut himself on the grater and is bleeding into the cheese.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm surprised and disgusted, but I didn't want to say anything because he's acting like a raving lunatic. Right before the first mac &amp; cheese batch is done, the guests arrive. I finish the meal, toss on some breadcrumbs, and have all 12 dig in. Everyone's complimenting the meal, so I at least know that no one's poisoned from Aaron's lunacy. It took them about 15 minutes for all 12 guests to give up, with both pots less than half empty (Each pot had about 3lbs of food).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm pretty upset. I now have $50 worth of cheese and noodles that I don't know what to do with, except make mac &amp; cheese for the next month. Aaron and Stan wildly overestimated the amount of food that they would eat, and let's not forget how Aaron BLED INTO THE FOOD. I've already seen the wrappers of the other cheese that I bought in the trash and everyone's avoiding each other. Am I the asshole for getting moody about my roommate's food habits, even though some have been the norm for months? Am I the asshole for willingly letting guests eat food with blood in it?",

It's been rocky for me, because my parents kicked me out after I'd turned 18 and finished high school-- to explain more in detail, I'd originally been planning on joining the military immediately after HS and had been recruited and training for nearly a year for boot, but things fell through once it was realized that I have serious issues with depression, ADHD, &amp; PTSD (these things can disqualify you from being able to serve). A few weeks after I graduated HS, things began to explode at my home. I was equal parts frustrated with myself for not having any idea what to do now/how to get my life on track, while also juggling what I now knew for a fact to be mental disorders, and also being upset with the psychologically&amp;physically abusive treatment my parents forced on me and my siblings. So I got literally kicked to the curb.\n\nA friend's parents took me in and got me started heading in the right direction. I applied to stuff, got accepted, and thanks to the FASFA my parents had filled out at a high school thing earlier in the year, I was able to afford to go through loans, scholarships, and jobs. My parents have re-done the FASFA for me yearly, but other than that we are not on speaking terms and they give me no financial support, period. I'm homeless outside of the school year and generally spend time with my long-time partner's family in summer/on holidays, helping to pay bills.\n\nMy parents ain't great.

We bathed the cat but as my bf and i were busy bathing the cat, i needed help to get a cup of water so i asked nicely for his friend to get me a cup of warm water. His friend decided to pour the rest of his mountain dew in the cup, mixed with warm water. He didn’t tell me and i almost poured the cup on the cat until i saw a hint of green. I just poured it out, washed the cup and refill it with only warm water.\n\nI get it that he’s my bf’s friends and i respect that. I even told my bf about all of this, my bf knows his friend annoys me to the max. My bf even agrees that he’s been a drag lately because of the use of marijuana. Honestly, he probably think this is all a joke and i could possibly be taking this to heart. I just don’t like having him around. Am i the asshole?",

Sounds fine, right? Here's the thing, though: while she was picking up her clothes, she informed me that she had to clean all of her clothes, and in fact she was dressed in just a night gown.

Maybe the bartender made a simple mistake, it happens but I do want that cocktail so I ordered again hoping that this time was right, the waiter takes the orders and the menù back and we kept chatting, I said joking to my friends that if there's coke again in my cocktail I'll send it back.\n\nFF to when the bartender was making our cocktails again and here it is, he is pouring coke in my drink, again, so when the waiter comes in I gently ask to change my cocktail since it is not properly done, so the waiter goes speaking to the bartender which replies that he does cocktails like they are written in the menù if I wanted my own twist I should've said it earlier.\n\nSince I don't want to make too much of a scene I said that most probably I was wrong and didn't read the menù carefully enough (but I was 101% sure I read it carefully) so I said that I'll accept my cocktail like it is, if in the menù there's coke and not sprite, so I'll ask for another menù since the waiter took ours earlier when he took the orders to double check. And Yes I was right from the beginning the cocktail is made how I said, and on the menù in that bar is written like i recalled.\n\nIn the end the waiter apologized and changed my cocktail making a little joke saying this time it will be exactly like I was supposed to receive it  and after that he offered us a round of free shots.\n\nI felt really bad while my friends started poking at me saying the next drink will contain spit and that probably the bartender was fired (which for the record he wasn't) but after that I felt really bad, I'm no Gordon Ramsey shitting on everything unless is perfect and was actually my first time sending something back, so in the end AITA?",

To start off, I was 17m, my girlfriend was 18f. We'll call her dirt. So, I had just started up another year of school. And already from the last year, I've had my own circle of friends. Consisting of 3 males, including myself. And 3 females. A balanced group, a few of them; dirt in particular, I've never really paid much attention to, and didn't really care about them as much as the others as they always had their own flaws that annoyed me. Now me, being decently young back then, didn't really ever have a girlfriend before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to my shock, only about 2 months after knowing dirt. The messenger of our group, we'll call her mike, so mike, had just received a little gossip on dirt's recent crush, which just so happened to be me. At the end of the day, mike told me about it. I was mind blown, confused, dumbfounded. Basically a surge of emotions rolling around screaming what the hell is going on?? But I made up my mind. I wanted to try having a girlfriend, and so I did. The first few months went smoothly, she was so kind, and i was kind straight back. And the time we spent was fun. I couldn't have really asked for more. Then, at the end of the school year; my parents decided they'd like to finish my education by homeschooling me. Naturally, being myself. I agreed on a whim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until later when I looked into it more, that I realized I wouldn't be able to see dirt anymore. So our relationship would become long distance from now on.  So we went our separate ways, still together. But not in real life. In the first 3 months, I was hit with a heavy depression by this fact. I wouldn't leave my room for hours and i stopped caring about things. And to make things worse, when I finally recovered. She changed, she was like a different person almost. It was subtle but I could tell. At the time i had no clue and blissfully passed it off, but looking back now the signs were clear and I had the chance to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when it started, no longer theoretically being in moderation by me, she was free to do as she wished. And as such, she could change her priorities. So she started caring less, as dumb as I was, even I saw this coming. But the thing is, there was so much more to it. even now I don't know the half of what she did behind my back. She started being friends with my sister, and she started ERPing as well, (which stands for Erotic Role Playing) Of course at the time I had no clue she did this as I trusted her enough to not have to look on her social medias, otherwise I would have immediately ditched her for cheating.  And after this, started the deception and lies, she would lie to me. I would want to confront her about things she's been doing that don't really sit well in a relationship. But every time, she would pass it off. Then talk to my sister,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not just being jealous here, she genuinely cared about my sister more than I. And I wasn't to happy as you could imagine, as that's not how this works. Multiple times i confronted her, to not avail. But, in the end started to grow knowledgeable. I realized that my issues can't be solved by no means that i've tried. And that I need to end it. She's showed all the unspoken and implied signs of a manipulative psychopath. So how would i go about this? At the time, I was still my too nice for my own good gullible self, I couldn't simply end it by talking to her about it, even on a whim. \n\nSo out of ideas, and approaching the 2 year mark for our realtionship, I decided, if I'm too weak to end it. I'll just get her to end it for me. So, I did the thing that annoyed her the most. Surpassing her, every time she tried to speak something factual, I would correct it, and the thing is, it was super easy, she's not the brightest so almost everything she said would have a bottom line or different answer. Eventually, she had enough and we finally broke up. There's more to this experience, but this is all that's relevant to the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in all in all, I simply want to know Am i the asshole for doing what I did? And did i need to do it that way? Or were there better choices here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 17m, 18f girlfriend started off nice and happy, moved on to be a pyscho, discovered things about her.\n\nDecided to try and end it, not good enough to end it, so i let her do it for me by getting her to a point where she was sick of me.",

She has this friend (J) that about 3 years ago, down in Mexico, got drunk and started talking bad about my wife (then my GF) in front of strangers the entire day and then at the end of the night, got into a physical altercation with my wife.  My wife called me at like 2:00am from Mexico, crying, told me what happened and said she was driving off in the rental car to get to the airport (she left J in the hotel room) and was coming home.  The entire way back to the States she kept calling me upset, etc.  J was also going through a divorce at the time because she got busted cheating on her husband with a coworker, who she also gave herpes to.  My wife has known J for 20 years.  J is also in her 40s.  \n\nAfter the Mexico thing happened, my wife told me she was going to cut J out of her life because she didn't need toxic people like that around her.  I thought this was a wise move.  My wife hasn't heard much from J over the past 3 years but has received the occasional reach out, \"I'm sorry\" type of text to which she replied politely to but never more than that.  My wife has said, when she chooses to shut a door, it stays shut.\n\nSo, a couple of days ago, my wife runs into J at a store and J starts crying and saying how sorry she was, etc.  My wife tell me this and I can only say that I don't like J but ultimately it was not really my thing, it was between her and J.\n\nMy wife got very defensive and said I wasn't supportive and that I only know bad stuff about J (which is true) and that we have all done stupid things like J did in Mexico.  I said yeah, maybe when I was like 21 or something, sure I may have gotten drunk and gotten rowdy but even then I don't remember cutting my friends down to make me look better and then fighting with them and I sure as hell don't remember doing anything like that in my 40s.\n\nI said from what I know of J she is unstable, selfish, toxic, mean, etc and I don't think she has a place in my life but if you want to give her a chance, that is up to you, just don't expect me to like her because I don't.\n\nThis turned into a major fight with my wife about how I should be supportive and how I don't really know J.  I told my wife, \"up until a few days ago, you thought the same way I did and only changed once you ran into J\".  \n\nI'm not sure what my wife wants from me.  I don't think many mid 40s women act like J did.  I don't want any drama or crazy around my wife or kids.  I can understand how J has good qualities as well but I just don't have a good vibe about her, even less so now that J is single and doing God knows what.\n\nNow, my wife thinks I'm an asshole and all I was really trying to do was be honest about how I felt.  I haven't changed my mind, I still don't like J and I think she is trouble but I will try and be supportive of my wife for my wife's sake.\n\nAITA?\n",

He has 2 kids from a previous relationship which in itself has been a huge adjustment. He is 27(m) and I am 25(f). When we initially got together he didn't mention the kids and so it was a surprise to me . Kind of a turnoff but I liked the guy so I stuck around. His kids mom is as crazy and obsessed as they come . Everything the first year was an issue because I was in the picture. She wouldn't let him see his kids ,and she'd pick and choose when and where and for how long. He would go without seeing them for months due to this. His kids are small 5 and 3 both girls, sad thing is due to all of the drama his 5 year old has the mentality of a 15 year old and carries out insults and conversations her mother talks to her about to try and cause friction. Now ironically his 5 year olds birthday is on Valentine's day . For some time his mom or sister would be the ones to contact his babymama for visits . Just recently tho his babymama said that wasn't good enough and needed to have direct contact with him or no go on the visits. It's really bothersome to me because of how toxic she is . So my boyfriend is trying his best and has begun messaging her and calling her to see his kids which he hadnt seen in 3 months. The other day I asked if he was gonna ask to have her for Valentine's to which he said yes . I gotta admit I was bummed .. things have been Rocky lately and Idk what I expected but that wasnt it. I got a little quiet with him and he got really upset and said I was being dramatic and that he sees me all the time. He also told me that he needs to be a dad and to stop thinking the way I do because its stupid.\n\n I can't put myself in his shoes as I don't have kids and I wouldn't know how to deal with this but I also feel so much pressure. I really tried the first year we were together by doing birthdays and holidays with them but I always was talked negatively about from both his family and his babymama. I got tired of trying and I stopped coming around especially because his oldest daughter would say things like \"daddy my mommy was showing me pictures of you two kissing , you love my mommy huh\" he would just tell her not to talk about those things and that,that was a long time ago ... Honestly it would get me really upset because I know she doesn't come up with those things on her own.. as I mentioned before I've been around going on 3 years now ,the other day i seen his kids and his oldest said \"hi  ohh what's your name again , ummm ,umm hey you what's your name?\" He told her stop playing you know her name and she got serious and said oh yeah I remember now .. idk why but that really got me going...

I was gone for a few days before discovering this which meant I had a lot of hot, rotten food to clean out of the fridge and freezer.

We had planned in on Tuesday of last week (Election Day), and I bought all the tickets then. Everyone paid me and what not things are all good. A little more context: I'm on the quarter system at my university, so this week is pre finals week/finals week and the week after is finals week. So Sunday arrives, game is at 6pm. We all kind of preemptively set 4:45-5:00pm as the departure time. 4o'clock rolls around and one of my friends texts us saying he isn't feeling well and has a lot of HW so he sold the ticket to one of our mutual friends; nbd because I like the guy and he's pretty chill. I come downstairs (we all live in this \"house\" on campus thats for like 30 people so kind of frat style but it isn't a frat) at 430, after finishing up studying to ask the other two how soon they want to depart. They both then look at each other and say sorry they don't want to go, they have a lot of homework.\n\nAt this moment I just become pissed because this is literal last minute cancelling and I essentially bitch at them. They say its not personal and that they just have homework to do and that they just don't feel like it. Plus, \"its finals week, cmon man\". This is all in the commons room and a bit extra people are there, like 1-3 who aren't involved, and I essentially tell them that they are giving me a big fuck you by cancelling last minute. I kind of go on to abscond them for a minute about how this is just bs leaving me because you couldn't get your shit together. My rationale is that not only was this planned Tuesday, but we all know our workload in advance so its not a shock like there was a lot of work this week. Secondly, we were all watching football downstairs that day, but I left for three and a half hours to do homework in leu of going to the game. And now I'm being called a child by my roommate (was one of the ppl that was going) and that I'm overreacting to something that wasn't personal.\n\nI understand that it isn't personal, but I'm still upset about it because they are my friends and they couldn't go because they couldn't plan ahead. \n\nI talked to my dad about this and he says that people just do this, that people look out for their own self interests and that cancelling plans last minute happens all the time. So AITA for calling out two of my friends?\n\nAlso just for closure sake: I went with the first guy, and invite two other dudes in the house I wasn't friends with particularly, but just wanted to not waste the tickets.",

In 7th and 8th grade we were best friends, attached at the hip. \n\nFreshman year we went to different high schools l, she developed anorexia and I developed depression. We didn’t talk for maybe two years because of wrongs we had both done. We started talking a little more frequently (and occasionally seeing each other) the last two years of high school. \n\nBetween our senior year and freshman year of college, I noticed she was really active politically with a side I do not agree with. I mean sure, she’s worn political attire before but it started to bother me. When Kavanaugh was elected to his position, she posted a picture of her TV screen (that showed him) with a caption that was literally just: “👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻”. As a survivor of sexual assault, that really hurt. \n\nI hadn’t talked to her at all the first semester of college. But two weeks ago, she made a social media post: her friend had died. I met this friend (Yolanda) once and followed her on Instagram. She was newly engaged and Beatrice and Yolanda met at an impatient anorexia recovery place. She was obviously crushed. I text Beatrice and ask if she wanted company, because of course I would want to be there for someone despite our differences. She declined but I brought over a pint of her favorite ice cream anyway and left.\n\nA few days ago she invited me to her house, which was supposed to be today. I was supposed to go over at 6pm. Well I got hit with a bunch of responsibilities/feelings really quickly: I have an awful family situation going on with an abusive mother, in danger of losing my health insurance, my new glasses aren’t the correct prescription, etc. I got home and it was too overwhelming for me. So, crying into my pillow I decided to cancel. Here is the conversation:\n\nMe: “I’m really overwhelmed tonight can I come over another time? 😭😭”\n\nBeatrice: “ugh ok- i wish i would’ve known earlier cause my friend wanted me to spend the night in *a town thats 45 minutes away* tonight”\n\nHer response sounded extremely apathetic to me. How would I know to plan my breakdown earlier in the day? I responded:\n\nMe: “I'm sorry that I had to cancel last minute, it happens sometimes. I just ask for your understanding that I had a lot going on” and she just ignored the text. \n\nSo overall, to me she’s turned into a really callous person. I was truly sorry to cancel on her last minute but it was only 5:50pm, she still could’ve gone and hung out with another friend. \n\nBut, AITA for wanting to call it quits over what is primarily political?",

My trust level in giving information out is pretty low and I'm not feeling the safest as it is. \n\nSo, the woman comes super close to me and says \"hello, how are you??\" I back away a little because my dog can be too friendly at times and tries to give hugs and say \"hello, good thank you and yourself?\" She then asks if I live around there.

She kept yelling after me but I didn't really catch what she said. \n\n\nIf she had said, \"oh, I'm a neighbor, just want to say hi.\" I would have apologized and moved on.

I’ve said I think it looks good, but Whilst I haven’t outright said it, I’ve tried to hint I’d prefer the other one (which I’d like to add is cheaper than the game friendo was talking about).\n\nTo round it up, friendo ended up getting me the second game, and whilst I’m grateful for the thought, I’m finding myself disappointed that they got me it instead of the other game I’ve been hinting at for weeks, I haven’t shown this at all to them, and I fully intend to give the game a go, I just wanted a second (or however many people) opinion on if I’m an asshole for being disappointed, and if I’d be the asshole if I kept hinting about the other game after a little while?\n\nApologies for the long post, TLDR:\nFriend who I’ve been hinting at wanting a certain game for a while got me another game of the same genre(?).

He is 8 years older than i am. i am 19 now, he is 27. \n\nmy parents kicked him out for the last time when i was 13 and he was 21, because he wouldnt stop smoking weed, disobeying, and he could not hold a job down even though my parents got him multiple jobs.\n\nhe went to Waco, where my mother who gave us up lives (i was adopted due to drugs and theft at the age of 5, therefore i hate her and have no reason to respect his decision) and he got into some pretty hard drugs. he called me maybe once a month, and i respect that because i know he truly cares for me but cannot get out of the lifestyle he is in. time went on, i turned 18 and moved out of my parents house due to complications, he figured this out and began messaging me over facebook, as he was not allowed to while i was living with my family, because they did not want me to have any connections with my previous scumbag mother other than one call a month under their supervision. anyway, i was ok with him messaging me, but soon the messages stopped, i didnt think much of it, as he doesnt have much money and i assumed he didnt pay his phone bill. i get a text from my mom while at work, and she sent me a picture of his mugshot, and she told me he was in jail for stealing from a disabled woman he was taking care of. \n\nabout a month later i get a message from him, i didnt even read it, i went on a rant and ripped him a new one as best i could through text, calling him all sorts of names, because what kind of person steals from a disabled lady? or anyone for that matter...\n\nanyways... he apologized, said he was with a new girl that he loved very much, had a job, and they shared an apartment. he asked me for 20$ one day because they needed gas money, i had to turn him down because i had just paid a bill and didnt have more than 15$ on my debit.\n\nabout three months later he is saying that he is having trouble with groceries... he asked for money again, this time i was in a good position, had all my bills paid for the month and decided i had about 120$ to spare for my older brother. However... there was NO WAY IN HELL i was just going to transfer a drug addict 120$. mostly because i didnt want him to OD, but another reason is that i wanted my hard earned money to go to a good place...so i made him an order on HEB curbside, picked out all of his groceries, got some toiletries... it was a huge order, mainly because i got all the cheap stuff, but that shouldnt matter. i set the pickup time for the next day, i called the ladies in curbside and told them not to give it to anyone other than him, he got the order, thanked me, and all was good. \n\nfast forward to mid december, he texts me saying he needed 30$ to open an account and unlock his credit card, and he will transfer me 100$ back as a thank you for the groceries. i decided this ONE time i would transfer him money. \n\ni wait two days, and ask him where my part is, or at least my 30$ back because insurance was due...no response.\n\na day later... no response.\n\nfinally he hits me with \"yeah i dont know, i called, they said they would get back with me monday\" \n\ni may be 19, but i am not stupid. the last thing i said to him was \"dont worry about the 30$, even though you probably never were, dont ask me for help ever again\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? he wished me a happy birthday and apologized, i have him a \"thanks\" and refuse to message him back. \n\nwhat kind of man asks his 19 year old sister for financial help, knowing that i am the last one in the family that will even talk to him, then screws me over???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR brother is a loser with an addiction and asks me, his younger sister, for constant help, and eventually screws me over just like the rest of the family.

Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room.

After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. ",

And she said ‘yeah kinda’ so I was like wtf and got my stuff and left with trying to act okay and not mad because I felt so shocked.\nAnyway that still kind of bugged me and then just now I messaged her this long sad message which I wanted emotional support on and then sent her a message a few minutes later because on this group chat she got added to with my friends who she’s just met and spoken to once she was @tted I made a joking comment about it. Anyway I check back and no reply to me but there was an instant reply to my friend who she barely knows and she never uses discord, that’s the only chat she has on it so not like she clicked on it for convenience so idk why she chose to reply some person she barely knows over me first, especially when I was wanting support but I’m just hurt and got annoyed at her.

Cut to today, I’ve had a letter come through the post saying the appointment has been cancelled and rescheduled for July. My mum is mortified and so am I.

Due to my feelings her little comments drove me crazy and weren’t helping at all and eventually I started matching her spirit and being very verbally affectionate back.

Other than this small issue, everything else is perfect.\n\n My husband and I have been having issues with porn for a while now. I use to be completely fine with porn watching (as I occasionally watch it myself), until I learned the extent to which my husband watched it. He looked at it everyday/multiple times a day, saving hundreds and hundreds of pornographic images and or videos to his phone or laptop. He doesn’t jerk off to it, just endless amount of scrolling. What really got to me was the photos of girls that weren’t nude at all. Fully clothed women and some photos of just their faces. This created an insecurity on my end. It wasn’t a trust issue (I know he’d never cheat), it was more of personal insecurity thing (did he want me to look like those women?)\n\nIn one heated argument he ended up deleting his reddit app containing tons of porn to make me feel better (he hasn’t re-downloaded the app, although he still goes on reddit through the web browser). In another heated argument, I deleted the Instagram app on his phone since it was filled will half naked girls. I felt guilty after and told him to re-download it. He hasn’t since (but still looks at it through the web browser occasionally). \n\nThis wasn’t affecting our sex life at all and I know men watching porn is normal, so I didn’t want him to quit it completely. We came to a compromise of: he’s able to look and watch porn on his own time as long as he tried to lessen the amount he watched and didn’t save it onto his phone where I can see (we use each other’s phones frequently). \n\nI understand I may have some deep rooted insecurity issues from my former long term ex who cheated on me several times and manipulated me into thinking I was just being a “crazy suspicious girlfriend.” I’ve tried to become more accepting of my husbands porn watching, ex. watching porn with him and checking out sexy girls online to make me more comfortable of the fact. Everyone knows if you keep something taboo in a relationship it’s only going to get worse. \n\nNow to the fight we had the other day, he wanted to know if he could save animated pornographic images to his phone as they are a form of art to him. I told him I was still uncomfortable with him saving any type of porn to his phone (even if it’s animated). He got upset saying I restrict him from doing things he enjoys. \n\nThis hurt me and I felt bad he felt this way about me. AITA here?",

I just feel like she's really intense already for how little we know each other, and I don't think it would be a sustainable or healthy friendship for me to pursue. I think she feels more of a connection than I do, probably cause she told me her whole life story over coffee yesterday.

These service dogs are not truly trained as service dogs. When moving in, Pat said she wanted the big room in the house so she could keep her dogs in there while she was at work. My wife and I agreed to this. We moved in, and she let the dogs roam around outside the room. We didn't mind, as they weren't bad or misbehaved in any way. Then the landlord didn't like the dogs being left outside the house, so she brought them inside and left them inside while she was away at work. \n\nOver the past two months, we have been coming home to find dog poop in the kitchen, hallway, and living room area. Not just in a single pile, but its normally spread out. It was one of the dogs in particular, so Pat said she would keep the dog in her room after a month of talking to her about it. We were happy and didn't mind the other dog being out as the second dog wasn't really a problem. Well, this week the second dog pooped TWICE in the house. The first time, my wife came home to it and there were over 10 spots where there was poo. The second time was 2 days ago. Pat had let out the two dogs in the morning. My wife got home and let out the second dog again. The dog peed outside, then came inside and pooped twice on the floor. My wife and I talked to each other about it, then she had to go to work. We messaged each other more about this via Telegram app, venting to each other our frustrations about this. We didn't say anything mean about our roommate, but just that this was her problem, and that she really needed to do something about the dogs pooping (mind you they have pooped in the house over 15 times in the past 2 months).\n\nThen last night we went out for a Thanksgiving dinner, and at the end of it I get a call from our roommate. In the past, I told her that if my computer is unlocked, she can use it to game or browse the internet or watch videos. I don't mind since she doesn't have her own. Well, I left Telegram open and she decided to read the messages between me and my wife. Again, we didn't insult her, we said nothing bad ABOUT her, just voiced our opinions that we hated having the dogs poop in the house and that we should talk to her again about this. She decided that she didn't like my wife and I \"talking trash behind her back, or talking behind her back at all\" and that she was going to move out. Today she began to move out her stuff from the house. \n\nWe have talked to her about the dog situation several times. She has brought up that she will get diapers for her dogs, or hire a dog walker. She has done none of those, stating she doesn't have a lot of money. But she goes out and eats a lot, spends money on weed (we do too, but not as much cuz she wont use edibles), buys new expensive wigs, and even bought a new mattress pad for her bed. She has friends who she borrows money from, but this doesn't seem to be as important. My wife and I are just very tired of coming home to find smelly dog shit everywhere, and we were just venting to each other about it. We of course don't share all of our feelings with her because we are roommates and we are trying to be nice and accommodating. We also don't want to keep bringing these things up over and over and over because then we feel we are nagging her.

He told me he told his best friends about my mental health issues and some of my insecurities. On several occasions he also told me what they advised him to do. I understand his need for an outlet but it hurts so much to know my privacy isn't protected and I'm constantly wondering what they're thinking when they see me.\n\n2. He tells me what he honestly thinks about me, like, he can't respect certain things about me because I make poor life choices because of my mental health issues. Let's just say he has no filter. Sometimes the things he says absolutely shatters me. It has come to the extent of me not telling him things sometimes for fear of his response.\n\nI'm not blaming him for saying these things because I get where he's coming from and he's just being honest but I feel like his need to keep his slate clean is at the expense of my mental and emotional well-being. The cumulation of everything he has said is exacerbating my depression and anxiety and sometimes I can't even function because I get so preoccupied with every little word.\n\nI told him I need what I define as a gentleman. Someone who will understand what to say and what not to say to me by prioritising my feelings. E.g. telling me what he tells his best friends is unnecessary. I would honestly be completely fine assuming he doesn't tell them my deep dark secrets. But now I can't unknow it. Every time I know he meets them without me, it ruins my entire day because I obsess over what they're saying about me. I have gone through a lot that I don't want the world to know - 3 suicide attempts, self-harming to the extent of endangering my life. P.S. - I'm not even forbidding him from telling them. I just feel like there's a combination of him prioritising himself and his friendships over me. But he says I carry too much shame over my mental health issues and it's a vicious cycle.\n\nHe says he needs to be able to tell me everything because that is what strengthens emotional connection for him and also he's lived a very fulfilling life adhering to this philosophy. No lies, no secrets, no omissions. A complete open book.\n\nBut it's also killing me. AITA for not wanting him to practice this philosophy with me? Or is it a deeper compatibility issue that cannot be solved?\n\nFor context if it matters, I'm 31F, he's 40M and we've been together over a year.",

Now, you may say, \"But elaboratenoodle! Horses are so expensive — you are very privileged!\" However, I can assure you that we are far from wealthy — the horses are our only \"splurge,\" and I don't enjoy or ever ride them. Because of the horses, my mother has disrupted our lives in a bunch of little ways, but the biggest issue was when she moved our whole family to a different county in order to buy a farm, which meant leaving all of my friends behind and moving to an area where the closest grocery store is almost half an hour away, and going to my office (which I only do once a week) takes almost an hour. But, the little things are just as bad — things like selling our beloved pop-up camper to buy a horse trailer. Now, as every pre-teen has inevitably been told, *owning horses is expensive*. And, yeah, it can be. However, the prices goes up significantly when the two perfectionists that are my parents decide to purchase *a farm*, a brand new truck, a tractor, and a horse trailer.\n\nMy parents are pretty smart, but all of these things are pretty financially taxing, and I know we're in a lot of debt. Now, don't get me wrong: I still have an amazing life, and my parents really do care about and love me and my siblings. They even helped me to buy my first car, and pay for my insurance. Still, I still am not happy about this horse scenario. Because we are in debt, I feel *really* guilty whenever they spend money on me at all — I've started paying for my own tuition, a lot of my own food, and I will occasionally secretly cover their grocery bills when I go shopping. But, it's taken a toll on our lives: we avoid making necessary repairs to our house and our cars, paying the taxes is always an ordeal, and we can't afford to go on any trips.\n\nNow, I understand that it's their money, and I appreciate everything that they do for me. But now, I'm preparing to go to college, and their income is high enough to prevent me from getting good financial aid, but because they spend it so foolishly, they can't afford to even help me a little, like paying for my books or helping me out with the cost of housing. And I know that I don't deserve any of their money, but I am still not thrilled about the prospect of owing \\~$100,000 for college (and no, I am not going to community college; the closest \"community\" college is farther away than several four-year universities).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Situation:**\n\nSo, as you can tell, I am not super thrilled about the horses, and they've been a lot of trouble from my perspective. But, they are really something she enjoys, and a way for her to connect with my sister. Okay, great. But, one challenge is that my sister chose to attend a brick and mortar school, meaning that only myself and my mother are home during the day. Because of this, my mom often tries to guilt me into helping her with the \"daily chores,\" which include obsessively cleaning up after her horses, as well as brushing them, feeding them, and occasionally riding them.\n\nUnfortunately, I am very busy at all times: I have an intense course load (trust me, it's not the type of online school you're thinking of), in addition to a bunch of extracurriculars, as well as my responsibilities as my company's only web developer / IT specialist / technical support representative. I have a crazy life, but I am very lonely and depressed, which isn't great when combined with a huge workload. I am awake and working from about 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM, I have no local friends outside of work (and all of those people are a lot older than me), and the only time I get out of the house is when I go to the office or go skiing with my dad (we got really cheap season passes for which I had to pay most of the price). My mom, however doesn't really have time for this either, as she also works, in addition to having to take care of the house during the day, but I really don't think it's fair for me to expect me to add even more chaos to my life for these stupid animals — chaos that leaves me covered in filth for the rest of my day. I feel guilty for leaving her so much work, but I really do not need more stress in my life right now. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My mother has thrown our lives into chaos because of her horses, and I don't want to help take care of them.",

Not sure how to describe his attitude about it really, he was just really content and loved life I guess. He liked his business the way it was, and he was good friends with many of the the owners of the local ''rival'' business.\n\nI have wanted to take a different approach to it. I want to win, basically. **I want to destroy my competitors**, I have no delusions of grandeur in that I expect to become a multi-millionaire (so I'll get that out of the way), but I can definitely see a lot of potential for growth. I want them to go out of business and expand.\n\nSo I went for a drink with my sister (24F) and mother (55F) and we had a few drinks.

            "input": "Sorry for any weird formatting, I'm on mobile. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's still pretty damn long, so apologies in advance. \n\nI'm a sophomore in college and my birthday was late in January. Towards the beginning of the month during break I had asked my mom if they would be able to come down to campus around my birthday and do something with me and my friends. I wasn't sure if financially they could, as a couple things had happened that made money more of a concern than usual. She told me not to worry about that and to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nOver the next few weeks I had a lot to do - with classes starting, research, my grading job, and trying to find time for my friends and a little for myself I was pretty busy. Because of this I kept forgetting to figure out what I wanted to do when they came. My mom continued asking every few days or so, but I kept forgetting (this is a common problem with me and it's really frustrating, it leads to issues for me sometimes). I should also note that I'll miss calls or texts from them a decent amount because I'm not around my phone often, but at home I'm more attentive to it because I have much more free time. This frustrates my parents, especially my mom, as they think I don't pay attention to them. Anyway, it got a to few days before the weekend before my birthday, and my parents told me they couldn't make it that morning and would come next weekend.\n\nI decided that week that I wanted to either go bowling or play mini golf, depending on what worked best for everyone. I told my mom, and she said I needed to figure out which for sure, what time, who was coming, if anyone needed a ride, etc. I'd say this was about Monday, maybe? I was busy throughout the week and didn't have much time to talk to people, alongside the fact that I would constantly forget only to remember later and feel anxious about it.\n\nThis all finally came to a head last night, where my mom snapped. Something important is that she has some anger issues. She would never hurt me or anything, but she gets extremely angry and screams. Well, that's what happened. I was with my girlfriend in bed late at night and had forgotten my phone in a different room. I remembered it and went to grab it. Then I saw my mom had texted me several times and tried to call me 10 times in the span of two minutes. I should also note that using Tasker I had it set up on my phone so that if I shook my phone, it would mute all sound and automatically reject calls. I had left it on before I left my phone, so no sound was being played and all calls were being rejected.\n\nSo I shit myself out of terror and called her immediately. She then yelled at me for 7 minutes about how I didn't care about her or my dad and that I was being disrespectful for not getting back to her sooner. There was more she said, but I've forgotten most due to a bit of overload and just generally being forgetful. She concluded by asking why if I don't care, she should care and said something else after that. I couldn't hear the last part because I was exhausted, so I asked what she said and apologized saying that I was tired and missed it. Then she said \"You know what? I'm done. BYE!\" and hung up on me. My girlfriend and I talked about it, and I turned my volume on anticipating that I would get a call back. About 20 minutes later I did.\n\nI can't remember much of that call, just that it was upsetting. At one point I know she said if I disrespected her like that again she would keep my truck (which is being repaired - they're paying for the repairs if that matters), break my phone, bring me home every weekend, and at some other point she said she'd break my fingers (dont remember how that came up? It was still while saying basically that I had better never do that again. I should also clarify that my mom has never hurt me and I know she wont, even if she threatens to sometimes when she gets really angry). Those were the most intense things, but the rest of the call was also pretty bad. Sorry I can't give more of it.\n\nEarlier today my Dad called to figure out what I had wanted to do. I told him what I had planned and we put together the last parts (ended up being bowling if anyone cares). He was also angry about how I had waited until the last minute and yelled at me a bit too, though it wasn't nearly as bad as with my mom. He basically was telling me how frustrating it was to not be able to contact me when they need me, and that it seems like I don't care about them. He did say they wanted to do this for me and see me but it seemed like I didn't care at all. In addition he said I was stressing my mom out because they didn't know what was going on yet, that my mom was already feeling sick and that was making it worse, and that they spent an hour last night talking about me and this whole thing when they could've been sleeping. My mom was there too and said something along the lines of how I only want their money and don't give a damn about them. After a bit of that we hung up, and that's where I am now.\n\nSo, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I really should've figured things out earlier. I meant to, I just was busy and kept forgetting, though my parents say that's not an excuse. I can be pretty bad about getting back to them sometimes. Usually I'll respond within a day, but once in a while I'll miss it for longer. I can see how that would be frustrating. But on the other hand, I feel like they, especially my mom, went way overboard and that it wasnt nearly bad enough to justify that kind of response. This sort of thing happens somewhat often and I usually feel conflicted about it. I've wanted to post before, but never did until now. So, AITA?",

The stop to exit is at the bottom of a big hill coming around a blind corner and there is at least one rear end accident a month because people go too fast down hill and can't see that there's a car stopped there. \nThis is exactly what happened to me yesterday. I was waiting to exit onto the road and was absolutely slammed into which pretty much totaled my car. Thank god there's no injuries, I got very very lucky. \n\nSo here's where it gets weird and where I may very much be an asshole. When I got out there was this absolutely stunningly gorgeous girl looking over the damage and crying her eyes out and saying how incredibly sorry she was. I THOUGHT she was saying that she was distracted and had made a huge mistake and therefore assumed she was the driver. I told her that it was ok and that we'd let insurance cover it and maybe it wasn't that bad and that she really had nothing to be sorry for since accidents happen to all of us. We talked for maybe 2 minutes and I was in such shock that I had no idea what I said, she is now claiming that I said that I wouldn't call the police or even turn it into my insurance. I MAY have said that, but I don't think that I did...but honestly I was shaking so bad that I don't know what exactly I said. \n\nAfter I got done chatting with her another girl started to get out of the drivers seat. I was completely confused because like I said I assumed the girl I'd been talking to had been the driver but it turns out I was wrong. To put it mildly, the actual driver was not nearly as \"cute\" as the other driver was the first thing that I noticed. She was so obese that she was essentially stuck in the car and her friend went around to help her. And instead of crying or being sorry like the girl I thought was driving had been, the actual driver got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder at me about what an asshole I was to have been stopped there, how it was totally my fault, etc. I was so pissed I instantly called the campus police to have them come do a police report. \nBut because I had allegedly \"forgiven\" the girl I thought was driving, both of them started calling me everything from asshole to nice guy because they assumed I was willing to let the \"pretty\" girl slide on the accident. I honestly don't think I ever said that but I do admit I was much nicer to her which was partly based on her looks in total honesty, but so much more based on her attitude and not blaming me. the police found the driver at fault but even the officer gave me a dirty look when she found out what I allegedly said to the \"pretty\" girl.\n\nAm I the asshole for treating these girls differently and being much more congenial to the pretty girl than the way I'm going after the girl who actually caused the accident?",

A girl contacted me and confided that he had groomed her, and was flirting with underage girls so he could have sex with them the minute they became legal, then ditch them. This is a crime in my country. She sent printscreens that looked dodgy. I mentioned this to said former friend in an argument where I cut him off for stabbing me in the back. Didn't say I was going to make them public or anything like that and his response was to immediately block me. This made me suspicious but still not overwhelmingly convinced. Former friend then spent 3 months on a total smear campaign about me. Since I had blocked him on messenger (he blocked my entire fb profile as soon as he read my message saying I had seen dodgy stuff about the way he treats underage girls) and mails people I'm friends with , badmouthing me, taunting them etc. During this time, more girls came forward confirming he had done the same things to them when they were underage, and one even saying he had slept with an underager.\n\nThis was incredibly alarming so I brought police attention to it.  Police said I was right to call as this is a concern, and that they'll need to talk to the actual victims to move forward. I tell the girls this and they agree to do that. That marks the end of my involvement. Someone said former friend finds out a couple of hours later , and now everyone's calling me an asshole and posting statuses about me on FB, calling me a liar, accusing me of trying to ruin his life because I'm \"jealous\", mailing everyone I know calling me a liar. The girls' timelines all check out, and the former friend was always *extremely* questionable when it came to girls, so I'm on the fence. Especially after his reaction/the last 3 months. Even though I stated this when defending myself, people are now harassing me via inbox, messaging others etc. and saying I'm wrong for contacting the police and \"butting in and reporting stupid stuff over facebook\". The thing is if I didn't report it, and the allegations the girls were making were 100% true, then I would feel guilty like hell for not reporting it.\n\nPeople are asking for the printscreens, but if he's done this to me, I could only imagine what he would do to his alleged victims so I won't reveal names/reveal printscreens.

I’m in a bit of a conflict and could use outside opinions. \n\nTo begin, at the beginning of August, I moved in with 2 random college roommate in an off campus townhouse. I signed the lease with two other girls, we will call them H and S. \n\nS turned out to not be a very good roommate but this story is not about her. She moved in and hasn’t stayed a night over sense. She also abandoned a lizard that was on the brink of death when I found it in her room.  Anyway, S is out of the picture now and I thought everything would be fine in a spacious apartment with just one other roommate. \n\nH and I got along for months, even would call her a friend. She is a nice girl but she is a hypochondriac and allows her boyfriend to treat her like crap. She has caught him multiple times on tinder with other girls, going on double dates with his brother and other girls, calling her a bitch on her birthday, and that is just the beginning. I have been supportive of her every time she comes home crying because of him. \n\nOn top of the drama, H has 2 cats that completely ruin the place. She does not tend to the litter box as often as she should, but insists on keeping it in a closet in the kitchen. It stinks up the whole apartment. Not to mention both of the cats are males and have a dominance issue that leads to spraying. She has put off getting them fixed multiple times, and now it’s to the point that the apartment literally reeks of cat. H is also horrible at cleaning up after herself. She leaves rotting food in her room for weeks at a time and doesn’t understand you have to use hot water when cleaning dishes. They are left all caked in food and slippery with grease.\n\nSince S moved out a while ago, H and I have been looking for another roommate. My good friend and old roommate D just got back from a 6 month trip in France and wanted to move into the extra room. H and I happily obliged. \n\nToday, D texted me saying that she was uncomfortable living in the apartment because it reeks and gave her a headache after staying for just a day. I keep to myself in my closed off room when I am home, so I don’t really smell it too much. I brought up this situation with H, suggesting we move the litter box to her room since she has the largest bedroom (by far) and it would help solve some of the issues. \n\nH completely freaked out and said that she refuses to move the box to her room because she doesn’t want her room to smell like poop (even though if she cleaned it regularly, this wouldn’t be an issue) and that she doesn’t have room since her boyfriend is going to be moving into it with her. This was complete news to me. He expected to live here rent free, use my refrigerator, tv, everything but chip in a little for utilities.\n\nI finally snapped and told her D and I are moving out immediately and that her boyfriend can take over my lease. I told her that I am tired of living in a litter box with someone so unwilling to compromise, let alone respect. \n\nNow, I’m not going to pretend I’m the best roommate. I leave clutter around every once in a while, usually mail or school work for a day or 2. But I’m not dirty.\n\nI on one hand feel guilty for snapping and causing conflict right before classes start, but I don’t know if I can handle another semester with her. I also want to live with my friend I have missed for half a year, but I want it to be pleasant for everyone. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for snapping on my roommate and moving out suddenly?\n\nTL,DR; one of my roommates has cats that pee everywhere, who doesn’t clean and is gross. My new roommate got sick from the cats and wants to move out and I want to go with her. I snapped on my old roommate for being gross, selfish and unwilling to compromise.",

He told me he needed a definitive answer within a week.\n\nIn 4 days time, I asked him to make some adjustments (changing a certain part I wanted to learn, removing some teachers, cutting some of my hours)\n\nWhen I asked him what the total price would be, he wrote a paragraph saying that he spent a lot of precious time in search for teachers and that because I made too many adjustments in such a short timeframe, he asked me to transfer the money within 4 days, to a bank account in another country (belonging to his father), so he could avoid taxes.\n\nBecause I’m still abroad and he asked me to transfer the money within 4 days, my parents did not approve of it and told me I should first meet again, before transferring the money. \n\nSo when I told him that and apologised for wasting his time, I got a message saying that he wasted 3 years teaching me, that I wasted not only his, but also other teachers their time, that I apparently didn’t trust him and that I really needed to work on my way of doing things and that he was really disappointed in me and that the connection (as in networking) has basically vanished now.\n\nI mean, I felt sorry, but I also think it was a bit of an overreaction on his part and that it’s actually very unprofessional and that he could have simply said ‘alright, unfortunate’.

I contacted staff members through the app and was generally being difficult: asking them to come deal with it, to pack my luggage up for me as it was right next to the bed and threatening to leave a bad review. They were unable to do anything, giving me excuses about the shop and stores selling roach bait being closed( literally just hit 9 pm). The staff member also accused me of leaving open food around ,telling me to just go if \"I do not like here\" and promising to back the fee for tonight. After an hour or two of literally just staring at my luggage from meters away I quickly packed my stuff up, stored my luggage at the reception and left. I slept at a Manga cafe and returned in the morning to get my luggage. When I asked for a refund for my 4th night two days later ( they still haven't refunded me) they typed in broken English telling me to be a man and to not still think like a kid.

I love my partner more than anything in the entire world and I could not picture my life without her. Haley and I have been together for about 4 years. When I was much younger I dated a woman named, Marie. Marie and I met and instantly clicked and what I thought was us getting on like a house on fire quickly became one of the most intense and darkest relationships of my life. It was abusive on both sides and not healthy at all. I believe it’s safe to say it was highly toxic and codependent but the draw was magnetic to say the least. Once Marie and I ended things we didn’t talk for several years, up until about 2 years ago, when she reached out seemingly out of the blue. I had been to therapy and worked out a lot of my issues (many of which revolved around my sexuality) and she had to. While catching up we both made amends for what had happened and seemed to move on with our lives. \n\nHaley knows all of this and was supportive in me getting closure on what was a terrible time in my life. I even showed Haley every message as it came in. At the end of the conversation with Marie Haley said she felt that it was great I got closure but asked me to sever the relationship permanently. I agreed. \n\nOnto the present: Marie has reached out again maybe about 3 months ago and we have talked every day since. Sometimes it’s about small trivial things and other times it’s about tougher emotional things. Marie was recently there for me about a death in the family- this was a family member she was particularly close to when we were together. At first I told Haley about the conversation and she brushed it off as sort of a do what you want but don’t tell me thing but I could tell it made her uncomfortable. I don’t want to stop talking to Marie and I really consider her to be one of my closest friends at this point, at the same time I don’t want to hurt the trusting and loving relationship I have with my wife. I know it’s somewhat selfish but am I completely in the wrong for wanting to talk to someone who I care about in a completely platonic way?\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for continuing to talk to my ex? ",

I moved out of my parents house to be on my own last year, so it's all very new to me. I'm not assertive at all and I have trouble establishing boundaries. \n\nI became friends with one of my neighbors and she's disabled (she weighs 500+ pounds and cannot walk/stand for long periods of time or drive). I would ask if she needed anything from the store if I saw her and I was already going. Huge mistake. She then started asking me for favors constantly; asking me to pick up her groceries or can I drive her to doctor's appointment. I have very small car and not to be mean, but she would simply not fit. She is very inconsiderate and quite selfish and basically sucks people dry and annoys people until they stop doing her favors. \n\nNow, all that being said, I don't believe she is doing this maliciously. She's had a rough childhood and her mother never taught her how to be a functioning adult. She is heavily dependent on other people. I have come to her with problems of my own. I adopted a puppy and it was very stressful and she's helped me with researching training and she's talked to me when I'm feeling sad/anxiety. \n\nI work full time and on my days off, I like to do nothing but play video games, do laundry, and be lazy in my nightgown. She calls me and leaves me a voicemail to stop being so antisocial and to come down for coffee in the lobby. I tell her that I'm not ready and I don't feel like socializing at the moment. She accepts it and we agree to talk later. \n\nI wind up taking a nap and I get woken up by her calling and I said, hey i'm sleeping can I call you back when I wake up more? she said that's fine, but I'm going to come up there (to my apartment) if you don't call me back in the next 15 minutes. And I'm half asleep and I'm just like yeah don't do that, i'm gonna fall back asleep. \n\n20 minutes later, I hear pounding on my door and i'm like oh, it's probably maintenance and I get my robe on and it's her standing at my door. I hate when people drop by unannounced. Unless it's family or super close friends, I don't want anyone just coming by because I don't feel like talking to the person. \n\nShe said \"I figured you would ignore your phone if I called so I decided to just come up\" and I'm just standing there like wtf? and she just walks right into my apartment and plops down on my couch. And I'm grumpy but I'm drinking coffee so I'm waking up. She tells me about more dog training shit and I'm just like, I've figured out a training solution that works well with both me and my dog. She still makes me take down all this information. \n\nThank god my little pup has to go outside to potty, it's been about 30 minutes that she's been in my apartment. So we leave my apartment  and she says she'll meet me in the lobby when I come back in and i'm just thinking *I do not give a solitary fuck actually*. I let my pup do her business and come back inside. \n\nI notice she has a wallet that looks very similar to mine and I ask her that I have one just like that. And she tells me that she found it on the ground and the ID says **my full name**. And I'm not trying to jump to conclusions so I ask if I dropped it on my way out of the elevator? \n\nShe says no she got it from my purse. And i'm like wtf? you went through my purse? She said that she wanted her food stamps card back because I got a couple things for her the day before at the grocery store. And I tell her \"Why didn't you just ask for it back, it's not even in my wallet, it's in a pocket in my purse.\" \n\nShe just laughs it off and says I love messing with you and I make an excuse to leave and go back to my apartment. I double check to make sure nothing was taken from my wallet but she just wanted to do a \"harmless prank\". \n\nShe called me that same night and I told her I need her to respect my boundaries and not to come over unannounced anymore because it stresses me out to have uninvited guests. She said that she just wants to be close friends with me and didn't really see the problem. Am I the asshole here? I don't want her in my space but she also justifies herself by saying she is just trying to make friends.  ",

Mine has about 20k miles more and is a little bit younger. Mine is worth about 2-3k more on Kelly blue book. We have separate car insurance.  I have comprehensive/collision and I thiiiink he no longer has comprehensive/collision. \n\n\nSince our driveway forces us to park each other in , for convenience, we switch cars about every other day. Aka some days I drive his car and some days I drive my car and likewise. \n\n\n\nWe have split finances and don't currently plan on merging them although we do have a share account for food/house expenses that we contribute equally to. \n\n\nOn to the argument... \nIt came up that he assumed if I got into an accident in his car and totalled it that I would buy him a new car (not new new.. just new to us). His rational was that if he himself got in an accident in mine that he would feel bad and would want to make it up to me and do the same. \n\n\nI replied that I wasn't comfortable with that. He clarified only if one of us was at fault for the accident/ it was caused by stupidity on our part.  \n\n\n\nMy thought process is that each of our cars are our responsibility to take care of.\n\n\nHowever if I dinged his car and it was fixable I would try to fix it/make him whole. But if the car it totalled I doubt he would get the same car/same year/same mileage as  it would make more sense to upgrade. I would probably offer to help with the cost.. but not front it all. That would put us in the awkward situation where one if us would have to buy two cars back to back potentially since both of them are getting further along in years. Although I doubt we will have to replace them for years to come.. hopefully. \n\nHe actually seemed ok with my reasoning and I'm glad this was brought up before either of us got into a bad accident (knock on wood). \n\nAITA for not wanting to buy him a new car if I wrecked it? \n\nWhat do you guys think would be a fair? \n",

A couple weeks later he texted us and begged for our forgiveness which I immediately declined due to him hurting my best friend so badly. She gladly exepted even though I suggested he shouldn't. A month later him and his ex threw allegations at eachother and both of them made her choose a side.\n A couple days later he pulled the same shit as last time and ended it over text with the same dramatic shit pretending he was the victim.

Both of his parents passed in that house, and he would like to go the same way.  Normally, there would be no problem with this.  There are home heath aids for a reason, and I dont mind taking food over to him semi-regularly.  However, his home I recently learned, is not fit for human habitation. \n\nNo, you're thinking, but OP if he's been a family friend since before you were born how were you never in his house before? Well, because cats and I like breathing. But seriously, he never hosted gatherings and when extra folding chairs or the like were needed he would go over and get them and bring them back. He's a super private person and has always been well groomed and presentable.\n\nHis health took a turn for the for the worse about a year and a half ago when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Chemo weakend him but he kept going. ~5 mo ago he got the news that it spread all through his body in the form of bone (and I think lymph node) cancer.  Stage 4. He doesn't have much medical background and doesn't want to know, but I don't think he has more than a month or three left. He can barely hold a conversation much less go upstairs to his bedroom without being out of breath.  He'll fight to the end. \n\nHerein lies the problem: I always knew he had a lot of stuff, he would talk about it but I didn't realize how bad it was. I found out how bad when I dropped of food and he couldn't get up out of bed to put it away himself. The kitchen sink doesn't drain, there was a water leak in the upstairs bath and now there is two inches of mold hanging from the downstairs bathroom ceiling, the bathroom likely hasn't been cleaned in years with shit all over the toilet. He doesn't take the garbage out and there's even mold on the egg shells. I ended up nauseous and bordering on an asthma attack after being in there for 2min. There are paths to get through the rooms but they are narrow - I'm sure a fire marshal would have a fit. I'm concerned about his basic hygiene at this point. When I saw all this it was 6:30pm and he admitted he hadn't been out of bed or eaten yet that day.\n\nWere he not dying, I wouldn't hesitate to call the county and get him help for the hoarding.  But since he is, which is more important: his mental health or what physical health he has left? A week in the hospital in December yeilded anxiety attacks from being separated from his stuff.  So, would I be the asshole for calling and getting him sent to a county home for the short remainder of his life? Or do I leave him to die in peace in his filth?",

I don't know if a) he just has a problem with me in general and is using this one issue to make it clear b) he actually has a problem with me talking to multiple girls c) he's just jealous or d) he likes one of the girls I'm talking to.\n\nEither way, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong, until yesterday, Sean sits at the same table as me during lunch. He was doing his usual passive-aggressive roasting, and usually I just ignore it, but I was pretty annoyed, so I just looked at him and asked if he had a problem. He then proceeded to call me out for 'being a fuckboy'. \n\nI think he was out of line here. Aita?",

Hopefully I can give a clearer picture.\n\n\nBackground: My husband and I are recently new homeowners in a state that is getting dumped with snow. Much to my husbands dismay, we don't have enough saved for the snowblower he wants, so we're stuck with shoveling it ourselves (sidenote: in case it gets brought up, no I will not pay for snow-removal service when both of us are strong, able-bodied adults who have the time). I work nights, 10 hour shifts, and he works days, 8 hour shifts. Both of our jobs are physically demanding. So far we've been good about doing our fair share of winter maintenance. \n\n\nSituation: I am working 12 hour shifts most of the week due to a surge in production (yay overtime pay). Due to incoming weather, his job notified employees yesterday afternoon that today they would start an hour late. The snow started falling at 11pm and hasn't stopped. I got off after 830 am this morning ready to take a shower and do some shoveling, if needed. Turns out it was very much needed as my husband didn't shovel any of the driveway (1 car length by 3 car widths of pavement), the back sidewalk (idk, 25? feet) or the front steps and sidewalk ( about 30? feet total). It's been snowing for 9ish hours so it's not a small amount, it's several inches deep. \n\n\nI shovel the driveway and the back sidewalk. I start the front sidewalk but I stop because I'm upset and think it's unfair. So I text him, stating clearly why I'm kinda pissed and that the front sidewalk will be waiting for him to shovel when he gets home. I also say that \"I don't love him any less, that I'm just upset.\" I don't want him thinking I hate him, I'm just upset at the situation. No response yet but I dont expect one until he goes to lunch. I suspect he used the extra hour this morning to sleep in, which he has every right to do. However maybe a text about how he didn't get to the shoveling would have been appreciated, that way I wouldn't have been blindsided. \n\n\nI've been going back and forth over if I should feel this way. Half of me is saying \"Suck it up, Buttercup, that's life,\" while the other half says I need to make my feelings known so I don't push it down and allow it to fester and manifest in some other way. So, fair Reddit, AITA for assuming my husband would do some shoveling before he went to work and not leave me with it all?\n\n\nP.S. I may not comment until some hours from now, as I need to get some sleep before my shift tonight. ",

We were in a tourist-heavy city walking around and taking in the views. Unfortunately, while walking around, she started getting light-headed. She pricked her finger to test her blood sugar and saw it was a fearful 41. Additionally, as far as she recalls, that is the lowest her blood sugar had ever been as well. For those unfamiliar, while it varies person-to-person, anything under 70 is considered very bad. Usually it results in the form of dizziness, weakness of muscle, and a slew of other bad symptoms. Even worse yet, she didn't realize it until we were in the moment, but she didn't have anything to bring up her blood sugar either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur options were limited, but thankfully, we were right next to a McDonald's and we figured it would be easy to go in, grab a soda, and bring her blood sugar up. Needless to say, it didn't quite go as expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where my assolhery comes into question. We got inside and all the lines were long and the room was flooded with people. I sat my wife down at a table at their bar area and skipped to the front of the line. I frantically asked if I could have a cup for a soda, as my wife is diabetic, and that I would gladly pay after she can bring her blood sugar up. The employees, as well as everyone I skipped in line, seemed noticeably irritated at me at this point. The employee agreed to giving me the cup, but I would have to pay first, as it was policy. I quickly explained that this was urgent and that my wallet was in the backpack my wife had, but he was having none of it. I ran over, grabbed my wallet from the backpack, and went back to the front of the line. As all the employees were tied up taking orders, I waited what felt like minutes (but in reality was maybe a minute or two) for them to finish up so I could purchase the soda. As he rang me up for the soda, admittedly, I angrily and loudly was expressed my disgust with the way they handled the situation. In retrospect, most everyone in the restaurant probably thought I was an asshole.

A few months later I suddenly get a warning that someone logged in on Netflix on another country. Worried about it, but seeing as it was from my GF's homecountry, I asked her about it and yes, she had given account access to her mother. I told her I didn't appreciate it the fact that she didn't ask me about it first, honestly if she had done so I wouldn't have had an issue with it. \n\nAbout a week later, I get another notification, same country. Took me longer to find out, but apparently her mother had given her brother the account as well. Now I was pissed, because at this point I felt like I had no control over who was using my account. She was telling me her mother didn't think anything of it, which fine, I think it's rude but let's give her the benefit of the doubt. I told my GF that if there were going to be more new login or access requests to please tell me first and I would be fine with it. It costs me nothing per month, and it's a major plus for them. \n\nBut then this dude started to log in on different devices, and I got in about 2 weeks repeated log in notifications from Netflix (about one every 2-3 days), and every time I would ask my GF to please check with her family. Every time it was. The tipping point came when my subscription got changed, supposedly I guess because the maximum number of simultaneous devices had been reached, and her bro (according to her not knowing English) just saw some pop-up  and clicked \"OK\" to continue and watch whatever. \n\nI was mad at this, I felt that at the very best case scenario her brother did not give a shit about using someone else's service, not understanding that this was lent as a favor, and should be letting me or my GF know before hand when logging in or asking if he didn't know what he was doing. At the worst, I now had a bunch of unknowns using my account. \n\nMy GF ended up getting her own Netflix account, which to me is a relief. But she still says I am a mayor asshole for making a big deal out of nothing and still gets incredibly upset when the topic comes up.\n\nI honestly fail to see how sharing something of mine with people I have never met, but asking the to notify me on Whatsapp/FB/Skype/whatever before logging in on different devices is asking for THAT much.

Since I knew everyone else was looking forward to it, I figured I’d order a sandwich from the sandwich place next door while checking out our groceries, and we’d swing by there to pick it up on our way out. We’d go eat at Culver’s, and I could just eat my sandwich on the drive home.\n\nHowever, my husband did not like this. He said I should have just “compromised”, and eaten at Culver’s anyways so we could eat as a family. He said he felt rushed because I was just “sitting there staring at him” (which I was absolutely not, in fact I was busy keeping the very crabby nap deprived toddler happy and fed, which was actually easier to do while not trying to eat myself at the same time!). He also claimed it was “weird” that I ate my sandwich by myself on the ride home. \n\nPersonally, I thought I WAS compromising by going with what everyone else wanted to eat while still having food that I actually found appealing, from elsewhere.  I felt like he was blowing it out of proportion - not that this was a huge fight or anything, just a minor disagreement, but imo it didn’t even need to be that. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?  Should I have sucked it up and eaten something unappetizing to me?",

Right now I’m bulking and with my daily activity, I need a total of 3800+ calories a day. That’s a fuck ton of food. \n\nAs such, I admittedly eat unhealthy. Desserts many times a day, soda (easy 200 palatable calories), a bunch of snacks. Unhealthy foods are much more easy to eat a lot of versus healthier foods. I do get in 200+ grams of protein, but to gain muscle and to gain strength, the only thing that matters is your protein and calories. \n\nMy girlfriend comes from a good place, but she consistently nags me about my diet. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not afraid of a vegetable and fruit are delicious; she’s just concerned with the amount of sugar/fat I’m eating. But as mentioned earlier, 3800 is a LOT of food. I can barely tolerate eating that much with my current diet; I physically can not scarf down 3800 of “healthy” calories. I can eat much better when I’m cutting/losing weight, but that’s probably 1/3-1/4 of the time. She wants me to me to limit my sugar intake to 1 sweet a day, max. Which, again, sounds reasonable.

I feel that she has a double standard when it comes to our relationship. She can spend money on things because she needs them, but I’m rarely ever allowed to spend money without her complaining. Funny thing is that when it comes to chores, she wants 50/50 in that area.. seems pretty convenient... She’s like a “selective” traditional gal.

I needed to talk about some stuff, just a mini rant to get things off my chest. I didn't want to bother Ben while he was studying, so I texted Jay instead. I ranted to him and I felt better. Later during our usual \"how was your day\" convo, I told Ben that I was having a rough day but I felt better after talking to Jay. This made him upset, and he said I could've come to him if I was upset, and I should've before talking to Jay. I said I didn't want to interrupt his studying and said I would go to him first next time. We didn't get into a huge argument about it, he's a really chill guy and we just carried on with our convo for a little bit before he went to bed. \n\nThe way I see it is both of them are super busy, but Ben doesn't reply until the evening and Jay replies almost instantly, and I don't want to be stewing over something all day when I can get it off my chest that moment. They're also different in how they react: Jay asks questions and gives advice, while Ben just says \"that sucks, just go relax.\" I usually always text Ben first and only text Jay if I don't get a reply, but this time I just skipped the middleman. The only reason was really because I didn't want to bother Ben and I knew I would get actual responses from Jay instead of \"sleep it off.\" \n\nAITA for confiding in my ex before my boyfriend?",

At my bf apartment, I get less of allergy symptoms even if he owns 2 cats partly thanks to having a normal bed. At my parents' apartment, I sleep on a pull out futon sofa, which wasn't really build for every night sleeping on - the pull out part is wood with thin foam on top, which got worn out quickly and isn't comfortable anymore + the whole sofa is covered in cat hair collecting textile, it doesn't matter how much you try cleaning it you can't get rid of all the dust and cat hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't happy with the futon for a long time, hinted to my parents for at least 2 years that I would need a better and proper bed and they tried to compromise by buying a thin mattress to put on top and an air filter for my asthma that I have constantly running next to the sofa. Both helped somewhat, but my asthma always got back a month or so after. When I sneeze, have a runny nose and cough for several nights in a row and have to take meds and inhaler to just be able to fall asleep and feel terrible in the morning,I manage to get a big grumpy when parents don't seem to care enough, bring in more saved stray cats (have 5 in total now, but we have a big apartment so cats are doing well, no overcrowding) and tell you to just do sports outside, while the allergy doctors are alarmed my lung capacity dropped so low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month I caught a cold that concentrated on flooding my lungs with slime I was coughing constantly and not getting any air when trying to sleep.

Since my kid was born 3 years and a few months ago I have felt nothing but dread every time my husband tries to make a move on me.

This resulted in me being diagnosed bipolar 2 and most recently borderline personality disorder. \n\nI'm extremely difficult to deal with and I will be forever grateful to my husband for being there for me. However, back when we were dating there was a period when we were living in different countries and signs of an unhealthy relationship started showing. I tried to break it off because I didn't believe in LDR, he would say he couldn't live without me, so he would guilt me into staying with him. I'm talking 2011. Sorry, I digress, but I feel it's meaningful. (We got married in 2012 btw).\n\n\nBack to the present. We had my parents over for a few months (this is not uncommon where I'm from) and them helping with the kid (great since I'm not that motherly even though I love the kid) made me feel great and gave me an awesome excuse not to have sex with my husband (not to mention our baby still sleeps with us), but when they left he started expecting us to get intimate again. I don't want him anymore. I love him as the father of my kid but I just...it doesn't work. He's controlling, expects to control my bank account. If I have any friends he expects me to see them home so he can see them (even if he does disappear a couple of days a week for hours and I don't inquire). If I'm on my phone he expects me to tell him who I'm talking to. I recently removed his fingerprint from my phone and he got all suspicious.\n\n\nI feel awful. I'm not working at the moment so he has all this power over me, which he enjoys. I don't know what to do. AITA for wanting to file for divorce ASAP and taking my kid to another country?

After 6 months they messaged me and our relationship rekindled and is going reasonably well except for the distance. My partner's currently trying to get their top surgery through the nhs. I'm in uni. Near the start we decided that my partner would be the one to move because they insisted, as well as me preferring my city because the both of us are able to walk down the street without people glaring. As the distance was the issue last time I wanted to try and get moved in asap, long distance is shit and as we're both young in low paying jobs at most we can afford to see each other 3 times a year.\n\nMy partner going to move when they got info that they could get an appointment with a gender therapist to get evaluated for top surgery in March last year and appointments are being organised for applicants from mid 2017 atm. Obviously it's going to take a long time; I suggested that I quit uni and move to England until my partner would be able to move here. My partner doesn't like this idea and keeps insisting that I shouldn't give up my future, I've got friends here etc. I know that they care about me and don't want to be the reason I quit school but it's turned into a 'nobody can move' situation and it's stressful. Our relationship is great when we're together and I'm very happy with them.\n\nOver the past couple of months I've been suggesting things like dropping out or my partner moving in and we get a bank loan and get their surgery done here through private care.

I'm currently in year 9. Be warned, it's a long post. So, I've recently cut ties with OF because I'm so sick of his bullshit. It started in year 7 with little things. OF would constantly take up the majority of the table in class, leaving me with about 2 A4 sheets of room, barely enough to work. When I would complain to him about this he would get really childish and say things like \"Is this better?\" while proceeding to take up more space. This got too much for me, as I'm very dedicated with my work, so I moved. Problem solved? NO. He'd move next to me and do the same thing. That was just the start of it. OF would constantly seem to be seeking attention, as much as I hate that term. He would do all he can to be the center of everything. It started with little digs at us, using words like fagget loosely without knowing the meaning or history of the words. He would then get to headlocking us and trying to yank our hair out because it was 'fun'. It got to the point where he would steal our phones and run around the school so that we could chase him. This annoyed me and Callum a lot, and in OF's defense we could have kept our cool a bit more than we did. Either way, we got to the end of the year, things died down, and we went into year 8. This was when things got worse. OF had gotten over the desk control, but had somehow gotten worse. He started insulting us and making fun of us for things like our body shape, really petty and immature things. Then when we would have a go at him back(again, should've kept our cool), he would resort to violence again. This went on and on. He could insult us but we couldn't even joke about him. He would also get very angry if he lost in games of downfall, and sometimes again, resort to violence. Things went on until 4th term. The boys invited me to be their goalkeeper for a futsal team. This worried me, and I'd be here forever if I explained it all. Basically I have on and off mental health issues and possibly social anxiety, not sure though. It sounds stupid, but the position of goalkeeper is a lot of pressure on me. I told OF all this and more, and explained that I didn't think it would be good for my mental health (I was right). Not to my surprise, OF wasn't sympathetic in the slightest, despite 'weawwy tweasuwing my fwendship'. He went on for weeks saying shit like 'OoOoHhH nOoO I can't be goalie cus I have depression! Get over it fagget.'. This really got me down, and I still don't understand why he said that. The same kind of thing happened this year. I felt quite down during a futsal match and he picked up on it. Same kind of thing 'if you feel like shit then don't come. You played like shit.\" This was the turning point for me, as I beat myself up about it anyway. I was sick of it. Am I the asshole for cutting ties with OF?",

Am I the asshole for bringing it up with her all the time? I feel like Im nagging her but If I dont say anything then we wont be able to hear each other over the phone. Thoughts?",

I made sure I was a friend who was always there if she needed to vent.\n\nThen, her friends started to ask her if we were dating, apparently even one of the guys from the men's soccer team got jealous. People thought we were a couple. We looked good together. When I make her laugh, I see people looking over at us and smiling. We looked like a couple. She noticed that and for whatever reason made her uncomfortable. She proceeded to avoid me for two weeks. This is the first time she avoided me. I approached her about it, she told me everything, profusely apologized and that was that. Fast forward to February.\n\nIf people thought we were a couple and we looked good together, she'll say yes if I ask her out right? I got a soft no, she wanted to stay friends. I told her if she needs space I'm more than okay with that as I probably need space too. After a bit of thinking over the next week, I was confused as to how she could say no. I understand there might not be attraction, but this was more than a friendship, we were borderline dating. So that got me mad. AITA for being mad about her not feeling the same way? I understand some people just don't feel some type of way for others, but we were doing things that couples do.\n\nThen tonight, after over a month of no communication, I checked in to see if we were cool. She said yeah and apologized if she made me feel like she was avoiding me (we used to bump into each other a lot so I should have seen her at least once, she's definitely avoiding me).

I didn't want one month of no communication to turn into a few months. She took it as though I accused her of cutting me off for the past month and got triggered: \"I'm not sure how I cut you off?

It didn't have to be anything fancy, it could be dirt cheap, but he has to treat it. All he responded in that moment was that he didn't want to make false promises and that he was afraid that he'll oversleep again. It was a bad response.\n\nThe problem:\nHe was peeved that my friend didn't stand up for him in that moment of time as he felt that it was rude for the parents to do that in the first meeting, and that he didn't want to spend his mother's money for that. My friend explained to him that it wasn't about the meal, the parents just wanted to know him better and that they could share the cost together (her siblings can also help with the burden by not coming). Heck, just coffee for 2.50 in total for the parents as they talk over coffee will do.\n\nHe reply was that, HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND HIS MOTHER'S MONEY, EMPHASIS ON THE MOTHER. And by that, he meant his allowance. Yet he doesn't mind spending extra money on fast food daily when there are cheaper and healthier food options.\n\nPersonally I think the guy's a total loser but 1 person ain't much, what do y'all think?¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

We just had two episodes in the past two months where random strangers lashed out at us in public for not letting them go first. She is Asian and I am white and we are in out thirties. She is getting self conscious that this may be happening because we are an interracial couple in a largely white community. I am wondering if there is just a greater expectation in small towns that younger people give older adults a wide berth and let them go first? \n\nThe first episode happened while we were leaving a restaurant. My wife was leaving through a glass door that opened out, and there was a women who looked about 65 years old on the other side. My wife went through first because the door opened out and then held it for the woman. The woman scolded her saying to \"learn some manners.\" I was several people behind, and it looked like my wife was there alone. I caught right up and asked the woman what happened. She told us, \"She should learn some manners and let me go first.\" I told her to lighten up, shrugged it off, and we left. \n\nThe second episode happened today. We were leaving a business while another woman also looking about 65 years old was walking up the path in the opposite direction to us. She was walking slowly as if she might have had arthritis or some other condition that made it difficult for her to get around. We were walking quickly and we cut diagonally in front of her to get to our car, passing about three feet in front of her. She was walking so slowly though that she did not have to slow down on account of us. In fact, if she were to turn towards the door she were headed for rather than walking straight down the right hand side of the sidewalk, she would have had an unobstructed path. She scoffed as we went by.  It was almost like a hiss. We looked back at her out of surprise, and she was glaring at us over her shoulder. \n\nIn all of our years living in various cities, while we have put up with our share of rudeness, we have never experienced anything like this. Is there some unwritten small town code that we should be giving older adults a wide birth and always let them go first? \n\nI like to think it might just be that these are nasty, self centered people who we encountered, or maybe we are just inconsiderate city people on the sidewalk, but I don't know. I know there are a fair share of people who are openly racist here. In my work it's not remarkable or uncommon to see people with nazi and white supremacist tattoos and I know there are some kkk members around here. Knowing that they are there is one thing, but somehow it would bother me more if that is why people have lashed out. ",

I understand what I'm proposing is manipulative, and I wouldn't even consider it under normal circumstances:\n\n- Yesterday, my dad told me that my grandad was diagnosed with lung cancer, after being hospitalised for the past week because he has a stroke. My grandad has been a heavy smoker all his life.\n\n- A couple years ago my mum's mum was diagnosed with lung cancer, and now has 60% lung capacity because of surgery. She was and even now is still a heavy smoker.\n\n- A decade ago my mum's dad died of a heart attack. He'd previously has another heart attack AND had a major stroke. He was a smoker.\n\nI've seen what smoking does to people, and I don't want that for my mum. My nan had to carry an oxygen concentrator when she visited us because that was the only way she could be mobile, for god's sake. My mum even quit smoking with my nan after she was diagnosed, but about a year ago she started again..\n\nWhen I was walking with my dad about his dad's prognosis, he mentioned that my mum was probably going to die of a stroke. It all just hit me, that **she will die because of this.** My dad gave up smoking a couple of decades ago, and he was furious when my mum started again.\n\nI want to save my dad from having to live through a third family member having a stoke.

Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard.  She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.\n\nMy friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. I’ve paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with our friend group. \n\nShe has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesn’t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.\n\nShe has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyone’s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyone’s calls. This was start her loved ones leaving responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called me for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent me into a panic and i had to go track her down in a crying panic thinking my friend would be dead by the time I got there. Every time is has turned out she didn’t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. I have stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass me.\n\nI was already distancing myself a bit because I couldn’t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when I foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so I told her yes but I needed it back in two weeks. She promised me she’d have the money back to me “100%”. She said she needed help because her kids’ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told me all of this a week later and genuinely didn’t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told me before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying me back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and I heard from a friend she already quit it.\n\nShe’s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday I get a call from her mom asking if I’d seen her because she hadn’t come home. I say no and automatically know what this is about. The night prior she had texted me bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to our group of friends that he’s not afraid to beat a woman. I knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. I was not surprised at all, I told my friend he’d beat her one day and my friend (who is also one of her bfs) didn’t believe me. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.\n\nIn summary, I’m caught up because I have suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but it’s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around me or myself. It seems at this point she’s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which I know can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore. I care about her and her wellbeing but it’s been 10 years of this chaos. \n\nSomething happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call me to talk about it, thinking that I need to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year. It brings a lot of stress onto to me and has ruined a lot of days for me, crying, leaving social setting to go make sure she’s okay or sitting around in anxiety over how she’s doing.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to stay friends but not wanting to hear or be dragged into her mess?",

Sometimes though I've been little annoyed, for example when she eats snacks I bought and reserved for myself without asking me, or if she just grabs my phone to play with it (even though there's nothing I want to hide from her). \n\nLast Christmas my family bought me a small bottle of fancy shampoo. My gf has a big bottle of shampoo for women. She has a long hair so she uses quite a lot of it. So when I started using the new shampoo my gf just casually asked before going to shower if she could use it. I thought for a while and said no. Maybe I was tired of sharing everything and wanted to have something, even small, of my own.

I also was \"friends\" with a few other people who they knew. According to them in the past, I had really helped a few of them, even apparently saving the life of one of them (planned suicide). The problem is, I have a lot of serious issues with depression and suicide myself and so many times I could be a bit of a downer, but I never tried to complain about my problems to them, and I always avoided telling them about my past and my struggles. This is where it gets complicated.\n\nI'll split this into a few parts for each person.\n\nMy best friend, who we'll call Apple. I met Apple about a year ago, and we gradually became best friends. Apple was the first person I trusted in a long time and my first real friend. We helped eachother in times of need and I think gave everything I could to help make them feel better. However, as of late I imagine I have been rather judgemental, due to my own personal struggles. It was frustrating and confusing to see my \"friends\" getting better and happier and me still being the same person, lonely and self-destructive. Of course, I didn't tell anyone this, but when Apple told me they had a date, I may have reacted in an... unfavourable way. I didn't say anything inherently rude, but I think I came off as a little salty and jealous. Shortly after this, Apple asked me what was wrong , and I told them it was none of their business. For a solid three minutes, and 13 messages, they probed and probed, not taking no for an answer. Eventually they said \"fine, if I'm no good to you, I'll just leave.\" My response was \"Okay, have a nice night, sleep well, and enjoy your date.\" I then went to bed. Apparently Apple wasn't actually being serious, and me being my Asperger's self, I completely misread that and made them feel rejected.\n\nNow, we'll talk about Melon (don't worry, this will all tie in at the end). Melon was a girl who previously had feelings for me that were not reciprocated, however, I feel I was always nice to her. According to her, I saved her life, and I also listened to her story and gave her a lot of support, and told her I would always be there to help her. She said the same about me, talking about how much she would always care about me. She proceeds to forcibly demand I tell her my past and my story, and says she won't judge me. A few days later, I have a Multiple Personality Disorder episode where one of the people inside of my head comes to the outside, and says some very eery (but again, not inherently bad) poetry type stuff. Later I apologise for the episode and say it won't happen again. She makes a post on her story which my anxiety tells me is about me, so I ask if it's me she's talking about. She gives a reply something like \"My life doesn't revolve around you,\" and my response is a sarcastic jab, \"It's called anxiety, and it eats you from the inside out, not that you'd know anything about mental illness, would you?\" This is weeks after I help her figure out she's bipolar. Admittedly, it was very insensitive for me to say, but these people became friends with me knowing I was sarcastic and bitter. I literally warned them.\n\nPretty much, she flips out because of this, and proceeds to call me insane and unstable for having Dissociative Identity Disorder, calls me \"pity-seeking\" (keep in mind she dragged my story out of me) and insults me in other ways too. She gets Apple and both decide that they don't wanna be my friends anymore. They tell me I never did anything for them and that I'm a terrible person and never loved them.\n\nHere comes Carrot. Carrot is someone who I was somewhat close to, and friends with both Melon and Apple. In the middle of the night, while these people's stories are lighting up with a hangout I wasn't invited to, she messages me telling me to back off from her friends. I'm like \"are you kidding? lol.\" and she tells me I killed her friend group and tore them down. \n\nEnter Rutabaga, Carrot's best friend. We almost had a relationship, but we decided to wait. Carrot tells me Rutabaga has no respect for me because I hurt her friends. I now have 4 people who are telling me I was never a friend to any of them, including the only person I truly trusted, Apple.\n\nWhen I show Carrot screenshots of chats showing that I was being prodded at and insulted, she denied it and continued to give no reason as to why they all hated me, just that I ruined everyone's mood and brought them all down. This makes me feel really guilty.\n\nTo end the story, they all left me and took another friend with them, Kumquat. When I commented under a post of Rutabaga's saying \"Nice aesthetic, I like it,\" Kumquat replied saying \"thank u, next\" to which Melon replied \"HAHHAA 😂\". in the end of this all, I feel really ridiculed and as though I can't trust anyone anymore, BUT I also feel like maybe it was all justified?\n\nAITA for making my friends feel like I'm cold, even though they knew that's who I was? It hurts, but was I the antagonist all along?\n\nThanks for the advice,\nBanana",

This is basically your typical abusive household where I couldn't even so much as bat an eye and before I knew it, I was a recipient to a backhand square to the face. I firmly believe that my father derived some sort of pleasure or satisfaction by making us and my mother feel inferior and truly undeserving of anything else good in this world. I wasn't exactly deprived but what I did have, was mostly provided by mother that made a living off of scamming people. As far as what she did to sustain us, that is a story for a different day. As time went on, he never actually improved and it got worse. My mom became a literal punching bag for him. My mom was never defiant and besides trying to stand up for herself from time to time, she was pretty docile, for the most part.  I've gathered from most of my uncles and aunts that being raised by my grandparents on my dads side was hard in every sense of the word. They each can recollect a time when they have been subjected to an indiscriminate amount of hatred. When my father would recall memories from his upbringing I would view this from a very empathetic point of view. My father would remember times during his upbringing where he sustained multiple beatings and punishment that felt truly unwarranted. I would like to make it a known fact that I too, have a child of my own. I have never laid a finger on her and as far as I am concerned, I am a firm believer that you can discipline your kids without the need for violence. I should have probably prefaced with this but I am a second generation Mexican-American and living under an abusive household in my culture, is pretty common.  Common in my eyes but not acceptable. I would be more than happy to reveal more details about how shitty it was to grow up in a home where walking on eggshells seemed less of a punishment than what actually took place where I grew up --DM me. Let's fast forward to 8 years later and I get the news that my father is getting deported to Mexico because he is being accused of sodomy, rape and countless other charges by a woman whom he had married after my mother. I have wondered for a while now if the charges against my father were actually true or if he had pissed off his wife to the point where she felt like the only way out was to press charges and get him arrested seemed like the only viable option. Either way, he is currently back in his native country and barely making ends meet. I feel like I need to address the nightmares where I dream of beating up my father and  it varies from dream to dream. In some dreams I beat him to a pulp with my fists  and in other dreams I am bludgeoning with a huge, blunt object to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. I do not wish to have these dreams but they come about, subconsciously. I have researched dream interpretation sites and all of them, for the most part, insist that hatred and resentment on this level, pretty much affirms what I have been feeling all this time. My father has lived in these states well over 20 years so he doesn't know much else. Since his recent deportation, he has had to assimilate and re-adjust to an environment he has not been a part of for a very long time. Because of this, I am receiving a lot of pressure from both my siblings and my relatives to provide for him in a way that would allow for his sustainability. I do not wish for advice. I have adopted a pretty firm stance that I will not provide any support. I have lingered on this topic for far too long. I have never been close to my father and at this interval, I don't care for it much anymore. Would I be so heartless as to say that I don't care whether he lived or died? I am pretty strategic, along with my partner about where most of finances go and cutting into what we currently have going on, would not allow for an additional expense, especially when dealing with another human being. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I grew up thinking I was a bad person, because of this and because she was often irrationally cold and angry with me in a way she wasn’t to my siblings. When I was a teenager, I had some major health problems that made it hard for me to take care of myself. My mom was constantly angry and cruel to me during that 3 year period. I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone who raped me, and I couldn’t tell my mom about it because she was more interested in yelling at me for “having bad judgment” for dating this person. I moved out after being kicked out of the house temporarily. \n\nAfter I moved my dad turned some of his abuse on my younger brother, who I have always felt my mom favored over my sister and I. He threatened to kick my brother out of the house, so my mom left him. My dad made the divorce very difficult for her, going on a meth bender and losing his job (she had been a stay at home mom for years) so she would have to lose her house and alimony. My mom has understandably been a wreck since.\n\nI recently confronted my mom about the way she’s always treated me, since she asked if I was angry at her and I felt I owed her the truth. She told me that she felt trapped, that staying with her abuser was hard for her but she did it so we wouldn’t end up homeless, and that she always took his side because he would treat her worse if he thought she was undermining him in front of the kid (me). She said she was cruel to me for years because she was under a lot of stress - her brother committed suicide, her mom for Alzheimer’s and she had to fight her mom’s husband’s family over her care, and she lost her support system (she had previously homeschooled my siblings and I and now she didn’t so didn’t see the same moms). She said her hand was forced to leave my dad because he wanted to kick my brother out of the house, and she would’ve done the same if he tried to kick me out (she doesn’t remember that SHE kicked me out because she was on drugs at the time and is in denial). She says she just wants a closer relationship since I’m mentally ill and she’s worried about me.\n\nAITA for still being mad at her? I honestly feel she could’ve done more and is in denial about her real reasons for leaving. She claims to hate my dad but still keeps in contact with him despite him being a meth addict and trying to throw my sister off the side of the highway the last time any of us saw him. Even if she is being honest, I would rather have been homeless than lived with my dad. And this is petty, but I’m also mad that she’s sad about her brother. He molested me when I was young. She doesn’t know that but she does know that he was a convicted pedophile and was always alone with me so I can’t imagine she doesn’t suspect it. I still love her but I just don’t forgive her at all.",

She lives with her parents still and I share an apartment with 2 other guys. Her parents are extremely conservative and I think are just making her feel guilty anytime she is at the house with them. I don’t believe it’s directed at her but her mom has said before to her “don’t get pregnant it will change your life” and so she will feel guilty just because she and I aren’t conservative and are definitely liberal at our core. Basically because of her upbringing and her background she thinks that sex is super scary and that she will get pregnant immediately if I never wear a condom. So that’s fine I wrap it up. I spend the night occasionally at hers and she’ll sometimes come hangout at mine. Never spending the night of course because that’d be the end of the world for her parents.  She claims to enjoy sex and so once a month I’ll get to have sex with my girlfriend. Mind you I have to pull out while I wear a condom that is coated in spermicide. She’s an athlete like me though and extremely skinny so it’s not uncommon for their period cycles to be out of wack. Some months we have more sex others we have less. She’ll blow me here and there and give a handjob despite me telling her I don’t like them. But every month the week before she gets her period she’ll say that she’s late (23 day cycle is normal for her) and that she’s worried about being pregnant. How could she possibly be worried if we are only having sex once in a given month? and when we do have sex, I pull out with a condom on right before I finish or I won’t even finish via having vaginal sex at all because we don’t have it enough for me to be able to have sex with her at a pace that I can finish at... (basically got mad at me last time because she climaxed and I hadn’t yet and it was painful for her. Gee I wonder why) I try and tell her there’s no possible way she could be, she goes onto say that I’ll never understand because it’s not my body and that I’m not the one that could have a human growing inside of them....\n\nMore background, she and both of her siblings all went to catholic school and her sister(23) recently got married to her high school sweetheart. Another relationship that would shame her about sex and sex before marriage. They supposedly abstained up until marriage. That’s something she had used to say but said I had changed her mind about that. And also had told me that beginning of our relationship last year she’d be able to spend the night with me more as our relationship progressed. She even brought up that her sister is moving out next year and she may move in with them. \n\nWe definitely had a lot more sex last year but I’ve gotten a promotion and she didn’t so she’s trying to focus more. And she also had girlfriends’ houses last year she said she was spending the night at but has since distanced herself. So her parents are a lot more protective this year than last and it’s impacting our sex life. \nShe claims to enjoy sex and sometimes she’ll be the one to initiate it. Only when I’m not talking to her about it and basically when I forget about it completely. \n\nSo I guess what Im just going to start doing is trying not to even think about sex with my girlfriend at all and never be the one to initiate it. Because it winds up just blowing up in my face when I do. It’s not fair to me but I’m hoping to marry this girl eventually and hope that she’ll sexually blossom in the years to come. But right now she’s driving me insane with constantly worrying and it’s making me just want to distance myself from that aspect of our relationship. \n\nTL:DR girlfriend has vaginal sex with me once a month where I have to pull out with a condom on. Complains that she may be pregnant every month. ",

I’m an accountant with plans to move out and go for my masters after saving enough money.\n\n \n\nMy brother has a bit of a rough past so I’ll try to keep it short. About a decade ago, he attended a UC pursuing a major in Chemistry. He lied to our mother about his grades and he ended up dropping out due to his inability to keep them up. This left him with a big ass loan that needed to be paid off and no degree to show for it. At that point, he was forced to work retail. There, he developed a meth addiction and was diagnosed with depression. With years of AA meetings and constant support from our mother, he was able to stay sober for years and was able to find another retail job with better conditions. Fast forward a few years later, he’s traded his addiction to meth with an addiction to junk food. He's a head cashier now, but has no plans of either moving up in the position, or backing down to go back to school.  \n \n\nMy brother and I used to be pretty close. During my college years, we would often bond, watch movies, and go out to eat. During the time however, I would notice things about him that would bother me. I was aware of his situation, so I tried to keep quiet in order to not upset him. One of them being that our mother would always do his laundry. He would also never clean up after himself. He’d never do the dishes. In fact, sometimes he’d just leave his dishes on the counter. He never did any chores either because he would always be too tired. He's extremely pessimistic and aloof about every single thing. He's also very prideful. Whenever my mother would try to offer some advice, he would straight up yell at her. He constantly complains about how tiring his job is and claims that one day he’ll quit or step down so he can go back to school despite showing absolutely zero signs of doing so. Whenever he’s home, 90% of the time he’s asleep. This kept up for about 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I eventually snapped at him about his behavior. It became this full blown argument which ultimately ended with him calling me a condescending asshole. Since then, I’ve stopped communicating with him. This caused me to stop eating junk food with him. After a few weeks, I lost like 10 lbs alone just from not spending time with him. This motivated me to lose even more weight. It's been a year since I've stopped all communication with him. I’ve lost around 100 lbs. and I’m no longer obese or pre-diabetic. Our mother has always been worried about me and brother’s health so she's delighted with this change. Not only that, but ever since I’ve called him out for it, my brother has been doing his own laundry and has started to wash his dishes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I a childish asshole for not wanting to speak with my older brother anymore?

Their haircuts are also great and relatively quick.\n\nThe one problem is the insane wait times because they're walk-in only. Whenever I've gone, besides my last three visits, I've had to wait for about 40min to even get into a chair. Not wanting to give up a barber that I really like, I resolved that I would just show up immediately when they opened. The past two times I've gone this has worked perfectly. This time around, it seemed that I might not be guaranteed a chair right upon arriving. I got there like five minutes before open and there were at least four other parked cars with dudes just waiting and watching the door for when they flipped the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open.\" I see a guy get out of his car and begin waiting by the door, so I immediately get out and do the same. They open the doors and the guy ahead of me is hanging up his coat and I see that my favorite barber is working today, so I bolt for her chair while the other guy is still hanging up his coat.

So I have to wonder, AITA for zooming to my barber's chair and not waiting for him to get situated, possibly giving someone else the idea to do the same thing?",

The young man on the other end had a real grouchy attitude towards me the whole time and was very (seemingly deliberately) unhelpful, responding to each question with a snotty, “I don’t know.” Near the end of the conversation, I said the word, “Starbucks”, and he responded by saying, **“I don’t know what that is.”** Now just to be 100% clear: A **Starbucks** employee, employed by **Starbucks**, just told me that he *doesn’t know what* ***Starbucks*** *is.* He hung up on me not long after.\n\nIf I **had** to guess, I would say that he was just being a smart ass, not serious. But I couldn’t be certain. The next time I went to my local shop to get some work done on my laptop, I came across that employee (recognizable by his distinctive Southern accent). I found my way to his supervisor, and had a private discussion with her.\n\nI told her, in a very serious manner, that I am coming to her with a concern that the rude employee (who we’ll refer to as Jamie) might be in the early stages of developing some form of mental disability, such as early Alzheimer’s or Dementia. I tell her how during our conversation, he insisted profusely that he has no idea what the name of his own company is, which made her eyes grow as wide as saucers. I talked about how my aunt, who developed Alzheimer’s at a young age, similarly started randomly forgetting basic things like this, and how I’m concerned Jamie might be in the same boat. I told her that tactfully discussing Jamie’s mental health with him, giving him tests, or recommending doctors to him would be a helpful course of action. She seemed extremely concerned, and thanked me for letting her know.\n\nI saw Jamie called into the back by his supervisor, and he was gone for a good fifteen or twenty minutes. When he returned, his face was as red as a beet, and he looked embarrassed beyond the imagination. Later that day, when he served me, he angrily questioned me why I lied saying he was crazy, and I responded, “You told me you don’t know your own company’s name, and I took you at your word. I was just trying to help. What did you expect people to think about your mental state when you say something like that?” AITA for thinking and doing this?",

She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?",

We've had our good times and bad times and in the beginning we both just got out of bad relationships and both made mistakes of misloyalty, i wont go further into detail, but this comes in later..\n\nIn the beginning we lived in different towns, i lived at home, we would see eachother as much as possible, this died down a little after highschool and when we got jobs. But we still hung out whenever we were free. No problems with no replies on texts. Then more recently in the past couple months, ive been noticing when i tell her good night and i love you, which i just thought was a nice thing to say and help someones night go well.\n\nHowever, my texts seemed to be maybe 3 to 4 lines, and hers would be 2 to 1 lines. But now she hasnt really texted me back more than once since i last saw her a couple days ago. I wont see her for about a week now,\n\n and ive had past relationships and earlier issues with cheating and whatnot years ago. I try to shrug it off and believe her excuses of 'oh i was just talking to my dad and then took a shower and forgot.' and i cant help but think  the only reason she wouldnt reply even in the morning is because when she looks at my text she opens it and just says 'fuck it, not worth my time' she is a couple years older than me, so idk if she just doesnt like texting or what, but when shes over, she'll reply to people right away. \n\nI guess this turned into a rant but whatever. If anyones reading this long, let me ask you this,  Am i also the asshole for wanting to have sex? Its been a good amount of time now and she never seems to be in the mood around me or to me. We'll mess around a little with foreplay and stuff rarely but it hasnt gone farther than that for a while. She says she just doesnt like sex, but idk what im supposed to do when i do.

Roommate a is moving in with her boyfriend next year and roommate b has asked if me and my boyfriend would look into moving into a house with her. Sure thing I’d love a house with a yard for my pup. \n\n     So we start looking and it’s become apparent she wants to split rent three ways, but we’re looking at two bedroom two bath houses, maybe three bedroom depending on the amount of extra space we decide we need (but no one would be living in the third bedroom it’d be like an entertainment room with space for activities we all enjoy like yoga for roommate b, my boyfriends playstation, and maybe a painting station in that extra room for me). Anyways she wants to split rent three ways, so the lowest price for a two bdrm in my area is 1000 not including utilities. Instead of paying 500 each (500 from me and my bf and 500 from her before utilities) she wants me and my boyfriend to pay 667.00 a month for the same space she pays 333.00 for before utilities. \n\n      Now don’t get me wrong, I agree me and my boyfriend should pay more if we get the master, and I’m willing to pay 50-75 dollars more because we have the master and the bigger bathroom (however if that wasn’t enough for her I’d be fine with her having he master and my boyfriend and I could have the second bedroom). I just don’t feel like we should pay double her rent for that master. I also would of course want to split utilities where me and my boyfriend handle 2/3 and she handles 1/3 of the bill. And we’d even be willing to pay for the Netflix and Hulu subscriptions for the house because we do that already. \n\n       I explained this to her when we were looking at houses and she says she sees where I’m coming from but because it’s easier for me and my boyfriend to raise rent money it should be split 2/3 and 1/3. I understand there are two of us and maybe I’m just being stubborn but I really don’t think that warrants paying double her rent. My bf and I both work in the service industry and we bust our asses for the money we make. A one bedroom one bath or even two bedroom one bath for just me and my boyfriend run 750-900+ and I feel like I’d rather pay the extra hundred dollars and just have a space that’s completely our own.

It's clear as day that no one likes Ashley. She is very rude, to not only Sam, but to me, our other friends we all hang out with, and just everyone around her. She is a total bitch IMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere Sam goes, she's there. When we decide to have a \"Guys\" night, she tags along. When she does, she's nothing but selfish, rude and talking constant shit while always touching and totally showing PDA. The PDA is the worst part. Sam is always paying for her food, meals, giving her rides to school then work. For context, Sam isn't the most...Fortunate man in the world. He's not poor, but nowhere near rich. He's about almost at low class citizen area. SHE comes from a very rich family. Has a million dollar house, lives in the best city, has cars from a Tesla Model X, to a Mercedes S-Class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, he's totally submissive to her and does whatever she wants. Sam is giving it his all for Ashley and she is literally just saying, \"Meh. Pay for my food.\" Sam is currently balancing 2 jobs and high school while Ashley doesn't even have one. The relationship is totally lopsided and it's clear as day that Sam is whipped. There was a time where Ashley slept in the same bed as one of her cousin's friends at her house. And she claimed nothing happened. And of course, Sam believed her and laughed it off. He's even bought her a $200 necklace she has never worn before. Which was about 2 paychecks for him. She bought him a hat. He wears the shit out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't even tell her parents until there 1 year anniversary, which was sketchy as hell in my opinion. He will go out literally every weekend to her house at 1am to go spend the night at her house to avoid her parents. Keep in mind they live about 30 minutes away. And he is always going over to her house. She's been to his house once and that was a few months ago. Sam moved about a month later and she hasn't even seen it yet. She is a terrible girlfriend and it's clear as day she is whipped, so WIBTA if I tell him he's whipped? Providing all the information and proof that says so. Or should I just keep my mouth shut and let him find out the hard way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Best friend is clearly whipped due to the influx of things he does for his girl, pays for every meal, drives out to her house every weekend which is a 30 min drive away, buys her expensive jewelry, she's a freeloader and yet she's extremely rich. He is pretty low class. She has been suspected of even cheating (which she probably has.) Our whole group hates her and thinks the same of her. Should I tell him he's whipped or just let him find out the hard way?",

Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then.

I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again.

This is more because my little brother (12y/o) adores him, my brother is fantastic at basketball and his dad's a great coach for him and even though I don't get sports I think he genuinely has a future in it, he just got invited to his first national tournament. Okay now that the background is out of the way here's the situation.\n\nSo about 3 months ago I got a letter from the local power company saying that I was 1,000 dollars in debt to them from 2013, but here's the thing I was 13 at the time. So I called them to figure out what happened and once they told me the street address I immediately recognized it belonged to my old step dad. Obviously I was furious, so I talked to my mom about it to make sure she didn't give him permission to do anything like this, because he's a great manipulator and that was about the time they were thinking of getting back together (they didn't) and she assured that she would never let something like that happen and she was just finding out about it as well\n\nMy mom called him and told him to either pay the debt or have it put back into his name. But the problem with that is he's currently living out of a tent in a friend's backyard so I know for a fact he won't be able to pay it but once it's out out of my name it's not my problem. He tells her that he'll do it and I thought that was that\n\nYesterday I call the power company so I can make sure that this won't affect my credit or anything because I have no idea how that works and it's better to be safe than sorry seeing as how I'm planning on moving out in the next couple of months. So after asking her to check my name in their system the lady asks me \"How would you like to pay your debt?\" and  I was LIVID (obviously I didn't take this out on her shes just doing her job) and I explained that I was minor at the time and she transfers me over to the debt collectors agency and after explaining that I was minor to a 2nd woman she helps me file a letter of dispute. But then she tells me that the power company may require me to file a police report and name anyone who I might think is a suspect if I want this to be taken out of my name.\n\nIt's hard because when I was his exact age my dad started drinking heavily and fell out of my life and that was hard one me. I don't want my little brother to go through that too, seeing as how this is punishable by up to 5 years in prison where we live. We're also super close, the kid is genuinely one of my best friends and I don't want him to resent me even if his dad doesn't end up getting jail time. Obviously he knows nothing about any of this and I'd like to keep it that way but if I have to file a police report he's eventually going to find out.\n \nSo if I file this police report WIBTA?",

It had been assigned for almost a month at that point, and the due date was literally a day away. Normally I'd love to help, but at that time I was busy with homework of my own, and I generally didn't want to replan my schedule. Now I told him that I really didn't want to, and to ask others if they could do it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while of him asking, I agreed to do it, but on the condition that his group would pay me for the editing work, much like if they had hired an editor. I receive the files later that day, and I begin to work. Now keep in mind, this project was due the next day, I had a physical limitation of 14 hours to finish IF I stayed up all night. After a lot of complications, I finally get it done with the help of another friend, and I call this guy's group to give it to them. I ask my co editor if he wanted anything, but he just said he was fine and went to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point it was almost 3 in the morning, and I had been working on the edit for a total of 5 hours or so. I tell them the thing's finished and ask for $50. They refuse and argue about why the price is so high. I didn't really think this was that high of a price, as I had spend many hours on it, and delayed my own homework to rush it out on time. After some more arguing, I just wanted everything to be over. I had school the next day and the most I was gonna get then was 5 hours of sleep. In the end I just told them to take the video, but if they could pay me that'd be really nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few months to my birthday. This was still a while ago, and I hadn't gotten any of the money from any of the people. I didn't want to make a big deal out of my birthday, I just changed my mood message and mentioned it if anyone asked. Generally for other people's birthdays, if I didn't know them well enough for a personal gift, I'd just give them $10 worth of gift cards in something like steam or amazon. Some of my friends knew I played this game alot, and gifted me some skins and premium currency. I was pretty content with how things turned out. The friend I edited for didn't get my anything but I wasn't really caught up on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day at school, I see him at one of my classes. He sort of pulls me to the side and hands me a $10 bill. When I asked him what it was for he replied that he was paying back the money he owed me for the editing (there were 5 people in that group, they split the cost evenly, I still hadn't gotten the other $40). I feel like it would've almost been better if he didn't get me anything at all. Paying me for a job I did as a birthday gift just kind of feels wrong, and I don't really want to get him a gift again this year for his birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking this way?",

It was gone by that night. \n\nI had received a different bottle of wine as a Christmas gift from my mom. I left it on the table for the next few days, intending to put it away, but it kept slipping my mind. It was one of those Game of Thrones bottles with a pretty cool label. Game of Thrones is a big deal in our house, and I had wanted to open it for the premiere. \n\nI came home from work Friday to find it opened and half drank. Pretty bummed, I wanted to know who did it so I could explain that it had been mine. When I found out, I texted him and just let him know what was up - that was mine and had been a gift. He immediately replied that it was the wine our other roommate had offered to him before it was offered to me. I explained that no, that bottle was gone. The one he was drinking tonight was mine. I got no reply. \n\nThe next day I was busy and really only saw him in passing. On Sunday afternoon when I saw him again, I asked if he'd be willing to replace the bottle or if I was just eating the loss. He got a little annoyed and said people drink his stuff all the time and he never asks for it to be replaced. Now, there is one person in this house who drinks other people's alcohol on a regular basis and it's not either one of us. And he knows that. I said I only cared because it was a Christmas gift that I had a plan for, then walked off to my room, deciding not to pursue it further at that point. I realized it was partially my fault for leaving it out. As I entered my room and pushed the door closed it shut rather forcefully. Totally unintentional, I swear. I wasn't really feeling more than disappointed and a little frustrated at this point, and I haven't intentionally slammed a door in anger since I was a kid. \n\nWe ran into each other a little bit later and he asked, \"You do understand it was a mistake, right?\" I said a bit tersely \"yeah, but you haven't even apologized for it.\" He started raising his voice at me at this point, and I definitely started to raise mine back in reflex. He was saying a lot about how it matters to him when people drink his beers but he never asks for it back or an apology. He kept saying it was a mistake, and I said I agreed that I shouldn't have left it out but once he realized it was mine instead of the other bottle that an apology would be warranted. That's when he screamed at me that he didn't make any mistake, but rather that I did. His reasoning was that I should have known that he would think it was the other bottle (the one opened, drank by all, and emptied 3 days prior) and open it and drink it, and my refusal to reconcile with my mistake was not his problem. \n\nIt was at this point that I got confused and dropped my raised tone. I said that made no sense. How could I have known that he would think that? He kept yelling, yelled that I was too emotional, then walked off. Now unfortunately he is also the landlord's son. He told me he wanted me out in 30 days. I thought it was just something said in anger and decided to let him cool off. I waited until I was about to go to bed that night and apologized for getting so heated and making him upset, because I was. I can be a little reactionary when I feel people getting upset with me and that's what happened here. My emotions were especially out of wack because I was/am stil dealing with being sexually assaulted on Christmas eve. Not an excuse for getting heated and I will own up to that, but it explains it a little. I never wanted a blow out fight over this, just a \"shit, sorry dude\" at minimum. Regardless, he told me my apology means jack shit to him, and that anybody willing to \"come at him\" in his own house like that would be willing to do it again. He said he lets us live here out of the kindness of his own heart and I abused that.\n\nHe served me with a notice on New Year's Eve in front of a roommate and a party guest. Now I'm being kicked out of my house over wanting an apology for a bottle of wine. Am I the asshole?",

In the 18 years I’ve spent living with him he’s never congratulated me on anything or told me he’s proud of me and he’s always telling me he may die before I ever impress him. My dad has been putting me through a very tough conditioning regimen for soccer before the season starts. He expects me to go to the gym 7 days a week. Now I understand that this not asking too much but he wants me to go for at least two hours regardless of if I have homework or something I need to do. I usually have to end up staying up late to finish my homework because of this. While the training is annoying the main reason I don’t want him involved is because he’ll take credit if I end up doing well just because he forced me to go to the gym. I told him that soccer is something very dear to me and that since he’s never shown me love I don’t want him to be involved in anyway. I don’t want him helping me train and I don’t want him at the games. I think he probably thinks that I’m too much of a fuck up to do well without his help but my mom says he only wants me to succeed and that he wants me to do well so I should just give him a chance.

Unfortunately another coworker (Monika) (F34) took advantage of that and often gives her part of his workload to do as well (and tells her to give it back to her to commit), which causes Sina to fall behind with her own work. Also, Sina does her work better, so Monika benefits from that as well, and when Monika does a shit job, she'll drop the task on Sina last minute and then lets her commit the faulty task. \n\nNow, I'd usually try to stay out of this (or at least wait until I have a good way to prove it to the boss, since I can't just record it in office), but here is the thing: From the looks of it, Monika is bound to get promoted once my boss retires (partly because of the work that Sina did for her). Unfortunately for me (or for her in the end), she's a very bigoted person that always talks shit about men in the company workforce, saying we are lazy and do a shit job, and that there should be more women anyways (I don't disagree with the last part though). At the same time she is the one who steals someone elses work and time... If she were to become boss, it could be quite problematic since I'm trying to get promoted to a different position where I need the votes of at least 3 company bosses (position my current boss holds). And of course I don't want a stupid lazy bitch to become my boss. Meanwhile I'm on good terms with Sina and I expect her to be more professional in said position.\n\nWhen Sina went on holiday for a week, Monika fell behind in her work, but intentionally didn't commit anything, probably wanting to let Sina do it to avoid negative feedback again... When she came back from holiday I talked to Sina and changed a setting so that work sent to Monika from her account would still be flagged as hers after committing. I also logged into Monikas account (I have a habit of watching people enter passwords, I think I know those of all coworkers by now), and commited all the work Monika had marked as completed but not yet commited (the stuff she usually lets Sina commit). \n\nThis didn't go unnoticed by the boss, and he angrily came asking why so much of Monika's tasks where flagged as Sinas and if that was the reason why Sina was always late with hers. It didn't end well for Monika (partly because of me and another coworker who said that we often saw Monika carry documents over to Sina) and she got a warning from the boss that she could forget a promotion and might lose her job if she does it again. Sina on the other hand got a raise.\n\nTL;DR: A coworker was being a bitch and pushing her mistakes on someone else. I exposed her in a sneaky way and made sure she'll not become my boss to avoid future trouble with her.\n\nAITA for doing this?",

I just really need a neutral perspective on this. \n\n  I have ADHD, which makes it pretty difficult to sit and focus in class without doing something with my hands. In highschool I'd find myself constantly doodling to help me listen to teachers. Through both highschool and college I've never really had any problems with it, until today. \n  \nCurrently I'm taking a communications class that's required of my major. Everyone gives a speech in class every two weeks or so. This class goes for 3 hours, so going in I knew I'd be fidgety. I got my speech out of the way and started drawing in my sketchbook. \n  \n It must have taken her sometime to notice me, because in the middle of class after a student gave their speech she called across the room for me to close my book and pay attention. She then announced to the whole class about how doing anything besides listening quietly was unacceptable and horribly disrespectful. Everyone went on break for a few minutes and I had time to put away my things.\n \n This is the part that probably puts me in asshole territory. If I was smart I would have not done anything and just sat quietly. But this is the 3rd time this professor has passive aggressively lectured me in front of the whole class, so I was feeling pretty grumpy. I didn't want to risk disassosiating and getting anxiety because of this teacher. So I took out my smaller sketchbook and turned more towards the speakers to show that I was paying attention. She was not happy about this.\n\n  After class was finished she told me to stay when everyone left. She then berated me about how horribly disrespectful and distracting I was to everyone. Because of this I'd be losing 10 percent of my grade on my own speech- and she was going to bring it up to the chairman because me drawing was that problematic to the rest of the class. She went on to aggressively tell me how horrible I was for a good few minutes. Even after explaining why I was doodling she said she didn't care. because I didn't have an accommodation letter, she couldn't(wouldn't) accept the excuse; and that other kids in class have problems and don't bother anyone in class. \n  \n I think she handled the whole situation rather horribly, but she has a point- I should of gotten some resources from my school's student disability services awhile ago. No matter what I end up doing I'm definitely going to talk to them about accommodations in the future so situations like this don't happen again. \n\nI grew up being a good student, so I'm honestly not used to handling teachers that don't like me.

My father has left many times throughout my childhood only to return a day later because he knew that if he left, I'd become homeless with my mother. \n\nThree nights ago, my father decided he had enough and left her for good. This means, that somebody needs to cover the rent - and I warned her since he left that she would have to find housing since playing the rent would require a roommate and said roommate would most likely refuse to house my mother rent free. She barely acknowledged my warning - muttering under her breath or changing the subject by flipping the script and saying that she couldn't believe her own daughter was kicking her out (I am in my 20s by the way). \n\n I managed to find a roommate that has taken a tour of the place and agreed to move in AND PAY HIS PORTION OF THE RENT! I updated my mom on the news and informed her that he would be moving in by the end of the month - meaning she has until then to pack up and leave. \n\nAlso, the whole time this has been happening I've been recommending to her to talk to my brother who is a single father with two kids and a demanding full time job to talk to him about moving in since she babysits his kids 6 out of 7 days anyway.

We were way better and connected more as friends, however he didn't \"agree\" with homosexuality and we got in a couple arguments about it, but it was one if the straw that broke the back to that friendship. \n\nMy best friend/cousin is a Christian and never expressed any type of disinterested in me being bi or any type of disliking towards gay people\n\nNow here we go: I met this Christian boy through my high school band program. He's homeschooled, a grade higher than me, and I only see him in band and after school Thursday rehearsals first period in the morning. I had no problems with him and we've even had peaceful biblical discussions and talked about his grandma being a Jehovah's Witness, and it was kinda nice being around him. \n\nSo two days ago (8 periods at my school so A and B days) in the morning were waiting in the band teacher to come open the doors. While outside I start joking around, and he doesn't really get my sarcasm/jokes so I tell him not to take it seriously and throw it back at me. After he said OK the conversation went like this:\n\nMe: OK. Now let's agree you're a racist, sexist, homophobe.\nHim: *laughs* You know, I was almost jumped last year for saying I don't agree with homosexuality.\nMe: *laughs in case it's a joke* You're just kidding, right?\nHim: No I don't actually agree with it.\nMe: What? Why?\nHim: I believe it's wrong because the Bible says it's wrong. (exact words, no this isn't a movie script)\nMe: *walks away without a word*\n\nI -kinda shamefully- immediately blocked and deleted his number, along with blocking him on Instagram and making him unfollow me. So today I refuse to do our usual talking in the morning, and after school as we were finishing putting up stands and chairs he walks up to me (don't remember exact words except the last thing he said so he's a close version of what happened):\n\nHim: Are you OK?\nMe: *slightly aggravated tone that pretty much carried out throughout the conversation* I'm fine\nHim: *concerned* illiteratetrash if there's a problem you can tell me\nMe: so you're really gonna pretend like you didn't say that homophobic thing earlier?\nHim: Listen, I'm not homophobic, OK? I just don't necessarily agree with it. \nM: I'm not doing this again. I've dealt with Christians that thought like that, no, I just can't do this again.\nH: But I'm not homophobic. I have gay friends, and I love my gay friends, I just don't agree with it. \nM: That's the thing you don't like it\nH: It's not like I hate people but I'm not gonna pretend like what they're doing is alright. (exact words, I swear this isn't a soap opera)\nM: I'm not doing this to myself. I'm bisexual I'm not gonna deal with someone who thinks like that. No. \n\nI leave for my bus a few minutes after that. Now that I'm reflecting on it about a few hours later I feel bad. I told my sister and she laughed at it saying \"Sounds familiar.

I missed out on many opportunities because of it. \n\nI always had a special connection with my dad. He taught me about music and history and how to think level headedly. He was always so forgiving and caring and loved unconditionally but he was a complete alcoholic and coward when it came to my mom. \n\nMy mother, is a complete narcissist and wack job. Life was awesome until she quit taking her xanax in 2013 and told NONE OF US. So we we're just left to deal with her mental abuse. She would \"ground\" me, well after age 18, so she could keep control over me. She attempted to make me quit several jobs.

Hollywood movies there are in English, but subtitled in Chinese, and I take seat in the movie theater.\n\nTwo seats down from me is this Chinese grandmother, at least 65 years old (possibly older) and next to her away from me are what I believe to be her two teenage grandchildren. The movie starts and this woman STARTS NARRATING EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE... I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese so I understand everything she said, although I'm sure it's just as irritating otherwise.

Because it's an old lady, I tried to ignore it. But after an hour of this nonstop, I reached my breaking point, turned to face her, and said somewhat angrily (in Mandarin Chinese)\n\n\"Excuse me, I'm trying to watch the movie, could you please shut your mouth?!\"\n\nImmediately she goes silent and no longer talks and I start feeling mortified. I could've worded it so much better and gentler but it just slipped out the way it did. I just finished watching the movie and left.\n\nDon't kill me, but from my experience as a half-White and half-Asian person, being quiet in a movie theater is more of an etiquette in the West compared to China, so maybe I'm mad at someone for cultural differences they can't really control? Also, I wondered if maybe her grandkids needed the narration (out of perhaps, blindness maybe), but they seemed completely able bodied so it might just have been a personality quirk. \n\nI dont know, I've been wondering about that since.

            "input": "My brother and my stepdad hate each others’ guts. I don’t want to get too into their history, because it’s winding, complicated and personal, so I’ll summarise it as quickly as I can. My stepdad has been around since we were 2 and 3 respectively. When we were young, we were very close. As we got older, my stepdad was very very strict and could be very cruel verbally at times. My brother was extremely wild and did a lot of dangerous and illegal things. I want to say that I genuinely don’t think either of them is blameless, though I genuinely think I’m too close to the issue to asses it objectively, seeing as I grew up alongside my brother. \n\nA few years back, they had a really big falling out. They both said a lot of terrible and very over the line things and they both made a lot of threats. My brother left by choice and my stepdad was glad. My brother is 24, lives in an apartment paid for by our biological dad (who has never been much of a dad to either of us in any ways except occasionally financial). It’s a very upper class, expensive apartment. He has no job and receives hundreds of dollars per week from both our parents and grandparents. \n\nMy mother has spent the last three years trying to force them to make peace. It’s very, very painful for her and has taken a huge toll on both relationships. My brother says my mum should’ve picked us over our stepdad. Every time we see my brother, my mum tries to convince him that they should make peace. My brother swears and screams and often walks off. In 3 years, his answer has never wavered.\n\nEvery year, we go away one night for Christmas. I’m on that night away as we speak. My mother brought it up (they’re both intoxicated) and my brother got angry immediately and started telling her if she kept doing it, he’d leave. \n\nMy mum asked me, in front of my brother, to tell my brother he should do it. She got emotional and begged me to tell him he has to forgive my stepdad. I said I didn’t want to be involved (a stance I’ve held for all 3 years) and she got very angry and now won’t speak with me.\n\nMy problem with taking a side is that I’m very torn. My relationships with both my brother and stepdad are very, very tense. My brother is known to fly off the handle and I’m afraid that if I tried to take a side, he’d never forgive me and I’d be burned out too. I genuinely believe I’m too close to the situation. I have a lot of feelings about both of them and my opinion changes a lot depending on what happens and how people act. I feel like I’m too close to it all to decide and like I don’t want to sway people to do “the right thing” when I’m not even sure what the right thing is.\n\nOn the one hand, my brother is selfish, angry and aggressive. On the other, I know he harbours a lot of abandonment issues and that he’s still very hurt and emotional about my stepdad. My stepdad is angry, mean and cold. He definitely said things he shouldn’t have said to us (with us as children at the time). On the other hand, he’s been married to my mum almost 20 years and I know she loves him. My mum is overemotional, but she’s also one of my best friends in the word. She desperately wants me to side with her, but I’m afraid by siding with her, I’ll make everything ten times worse.\n\nI hope this doesn’t come across as a shit post or something, because being so close to it and with everyone around me being so emotional with the issue, I’m genuinely unsure if what I’m doing is right. My mum has been loyal to me and I don’t want to be disloyal to her, but I don’t want to force something and make everything worse and potentially lose my brother entirely. \n\nTL;DR: my brother and my stepdad hate each other and my mum wants me to force them to make peace. I don’t feel like I can be a part of it, but that’s making her think I’m disloyal to her. AITA? \n\nAlso, sorry for the formatting, I’m sitting in a hotel on my mobile. ",

But it's okay- they're broke too and they're family. I'll do a lot for family without mentioning it. \n\nHalfway though all of this I'm *told* (not asked) that the adult brother is staying at our house for the next 2 weeks (laughable- it'll be a month or more, I'm sure) because he's yet to apply for a job transfer, search for new work in the new town, or even put in his two weeks notice here. He's the only one in that household who works so they can't afford him not working for a few weeks. The parents didn't tell him to transfer or job search either.

            "input": "It's me again :&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work at Starbucks, and have been working here for the past year now. I really do enjoy my job and I'm always happy when I get to work. I get along well with my co-workers, and many of our regular customers. Before I continue, I've worked in customer service for a few years now outside of SB and I am well aware that people are not always going to be pleasant. I'm usually well at diffusing situations and staying calm under pressure, which is part of the reason I'm pretty decent at my job. However, there's one customer who's a regular that I've been having issues with these past few months, and today was my breaking point and the worst interaction I've had with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe always has the same order - tall, extra dry cappuccino with whole milk. I'm also convinced that he doesn't really know what a cappuccino is. No matter who is making his order, he always sends it back and says that something is wrong - the milk isn't foamy enough, it feels too heavy or too light, the espresso doesn't taste correct, there's not enough of something or it's too hot or too cold... literally any and every excuse in the book has been made, and every single time he makes someone remake his drink. Now, he's older than I am by a good amount of years - I never want to disrespect someone older than I or stick my nose up at difficult customers, so I usually just stay calm and ignore it. I'm used to it and let things like that go. Starbucks is overpriced and inexpensive, I totally get it. But he comes in at least 5 to 6 times a week, so how can it possibly be made incorrectly every time, when we make cappuccinos at least 30 times a day?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Side note: He has caused problems with my co-workers before as well. One of my co-workers in particular simply refuses to serve him. She sees him come in, and has to go in the back and wait until he leaves. This is because he blew up at her and asked her why she couldn't do something so simple, and that she needed to be re-trained, and some other pretty harsh stuff. Not to mention, he also swiped a few dollars from our tip jar. This story is actually pretty funny, but another time. Anyway, I wasn't working there yet when this took place; this is just what I have been told. This had already caused him to get a store ban for 6 months.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning we were completely slammed. The line wrapped almost all the way around the store and we had at least 15-20 orders pending, with 4-6 drinks being made. currently We can typically only make 2 or 3 drinks at a time for each of us (usually two baristas make drinks - this isn't necessarily important, just helps more with the situation). Cappuccino Man leans over and asks me how long it will take to get his drink. I eyeball the very long line of orders, and tell him 15 minutes at the most. Most drinks are made in less than 45 seconds to a minute, depending on complexity. He gets visibly annoyed once I tell him this, and asks if I can \"just make his drink now so he can leave\". I apologize and tell him I cannot do that, as we have to do our drinks in order and it just wouldn't be fair to other customers. One thing that can be annoying is when people see how incredibly busy we are and then get upset when it takes longer than 3 minutes to complete an order, but I digress. He doesn't say anything in response, and just steps back and continues watching me and my co-worker make drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I get to his drink. Before I can even start preparing his order, he calls over to my other co-worker that's making drinks, and says to him: \"Hey, can you make my drink instead? I don't have time to wait on her.\", while pointing at me. Immediately, I got annoyed. But, I just handed over the order to my co-worker and kept it moving. I make two other drinks, and just as I'm starting to calm down, I'm called over by Cappuccino Man. Since he had already annoyed me a bit, I didn't want to be dramatic and start anything, but I knew he was going to ask me to remake it. I decided I would question him on what exactly happened instead of just bending over backwards again, to hopefully make some kind of change. Food/customer service workers are still just people, man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, he claimed it tasted \"off\". I pushed a bit and asked what was wrong, even re-reading through his order to \"make sure\" it was what he had ordered. He said the thought the problem was with the milk's density. I asked, is it too much or too less foam? He said he couldn't really put his finger on it, and asked me to remake it. I said I would make it again, but I wouldn't know what to change if I didn't know what was wrong, so it would be pointless. To be fair, we do ask what needs to be changed or what seems to taste incorrectly when we remake drinks so we're not playing a guessing game and wasting product. Then, he asked if my manager was there and that he would like to speak to him. I grab my manager and they talk for a few minutes, so I see this as an opportunity to sit in the back for a second to calm down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCappuccino Man leaves, but not before speaking to another customer, who I'm assuming he knows personally, saying \"oh, don't let the girl in the blue hat make your drink\" loud enough for me to hear over espresso machines running and milk steaming, which isn't exactly quiet. It was so completely embarrassing, especially with all of these people in the store and in front of my boss. I wanted to cry, honestly. My manager comes in the back and talks to me, asking why I didn't just remake his drink. I explain how I felt and apologised, but also stood up for myself. I told him I can handle a lot of things, but he was agitating me and I know I'm not incompetent.  I asked if it was possible to report and/or ban him, and I know I'm not the only employee who felt this way. However, Boss Man didn't really care for my side of the story. \"He's a regular, we can't lose customers, he has no reason to be banned, you need to not be so aggressive, this is grounds for a write-up\" etc. I understand that I have to have that \"the customer is always right\" attitude, and I can't put someone on blast for wanting a remade drink. He may not be purposefully trying to be difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gotten mixed responses on how I should or shouldn't have handled it from friends and family, how I was being unprofessional or how my actions were justified, but I can't help feeling bad for acting that way towards someone older than myself, and to a customer at the very least. Did I fuck up? Was this really necessary?",

I have also proven on several occasions that she has lied on a variety of things. She will say that her car has broken down so she can't take our child to school, only for it to work so she can go to a job interview later that day (with my child). She has told me that one of our friends was in a car accident and that I needed to watch our child so that she could visit her; only to see that friend post on Facebook 30 minutes later. She has told the government that I left both her and my child (it was a mutual separation) so that she would be bumped up on the list to get government assistance. She has also admitted to lying about some serious allegations about other ex-husbands because she was mad at them. So overall, everything she says I have to take with a grain of salt.\n\nNow, roughly a few weeks ago, I suggested keeping him on some of her days until she gets her life a bit more adjusted. This would have reduced her from 14 days to 6 days a month (every other weekend). Her response was to threaten to take me to court. She wasn't going to let me boss her around anymore and she will ensure that she has a relationship with her kid (which implied I was trying to prevent that). I actually 100% want them to have a relationship, which is why I follow the visitation schedule rigorously.\n\nOn top of that, I am engaged to someone who really doesn't like her continuous involvement in our lives. We are completely independent from my ex and almost never rely on her for any assistance; yet every month or so we are approached to accommodate her for whatever reason that I'm never sure is true. In a lot of cases, we end up accommodating; but I am trying to stop that because it's very fair to say that my ex shouldn't have so much direct involvement in our lives - especially if she is lying to us.\n\nOur visitation setup is that while I actually have primary custody, we personally have a 50/50 setup right now. When I consulted a divorce lawyer roughly two years ago, he told me that because this 50/50 setup has been the norm for years, she could take me to court, accuse me of being unfair and the judge could side with her. I have since started capturing documentation incase I ever do go back to court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The situation**.\n\nToday I got a text from my ex saying her drinking problem is getting out of hand and she wants me to take him for a week while she attends AA to get her problem handled. He is supposed to visit her tonight and has made no reference to her drinking problems until this morning.\n\nHer text implied she has not started it yet, despite having all week to do so. She has had the past three days and will have the next three days free to attend. I also believe AA is not a one-week-and-done situation and is an ongoing process, meaning she will need to schedule her meetings on nights where she does not have our child, anyways.\n\nHer family has expressed to me that they do think she has a drinking problem, but because of her history of lying, I'm not convinced that today's claim is legit and is actually being used as a reason to get out of parenting tonight.\n\nTo add to this, my fiance's father is an alcoholic. So if this turns out to be a false claim, that is *really* going to rub her the wrong way. All things considered, I've found it best to err on the side of being skeptical.\n\nSo, hopefully I've been able to articulate that this is a complex situation. I don't want to dismiss a potential serious claim; but I also don't want to enable more lying using serious claims like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Will I be the asshole?**\n\nI am planning on telling her that this is a serious issue that will take longer than a week. Therefore, I suggest she keep seeing him and maintaining their relationship while visiting AA on her off-nights and keeping her drinking in-check on her nights with my child. Otherwise, I will be willing to go back to my proposed visitation schedule from a few weeks ago from here on out and not just for a few weeks. ",

We live in a HCOL area so this was a big deal for us, a very significant part of our lives. Prior to that we had each been saving and living in random shared accommodation for years, so a huge motivation for us to buy was to have our own space together.\n\nThe property we got is somewhere we hope to one day start a family and so it is more than we need for two people. We considered getting a lodger and one of my best friends (let's call them J) was looking for somewhere at the same time. Despite being wary of ruining an important friendship through the friction of living together, we decided it made sense. This was the first time in my life that I was in a position like this and for reasons I can't really explain it was and I guess still is important to me that I was giving a friend a  good deal. We settled on offering J the room for 600 instead of 900.\n\nWe lived together like this with no problems for a while and then for work reasons my partner moved overseas. This means that we will see each other approximately 4 times a year for the next 3 years. I continued to live in the property with J for the next few months with no issues.\n\nThe first time my partner got time off work to visit was over Christmas. A few weeks before this we asked J if we could have the place to ourselves for a couple of days while my partner was here. His response did not seem particularly enthusiastic, but nor did I notice any particular resentment about it. J said he would work something out, and if necessary stay with his girlfriend. We did not discuss specifics such as dates and I was quite content that there were no problems.\n\nFast forward to the week before my wife got home and she wanted to confirm that it was still ok for us to have the place to ourselves so she sent a message with the dates we thought would be most convenient for J given the plans we knew he had over Christmas. His reply was very snippy and said he had not realised this was still a thing and it was not ideal to be unable to come home but that he would stay with his gf. We thought this was really weird but as he was away at the time we didn't have a chance to speak in person we just said thanks and left it at that.\n\nOver the next week J was very off with me, refusing to engage in conversation (messages) with me etc. This was out of character and definitely a consequence of simmering resentment that my wife and I didn't understand. Finally, my wife arrives home and we don't have much on our minds except each other and we have an amazing day spending our first Christmas together (not actually Christmas, just another day we chose to call that) as a married couple in our home that we had bought together (bonus: it was one of the best days of my life). As agreed J stayed with his girlfriend and we are grateful for this, despite being wary about his message and feeling that hanging over us. \n\nThe next day he sends a very hostile message asking us to do him a favour and next time my wife was visiting not to ask him not to be in the house he rents from us. I reply asking if that was everything that was bothering him and he confirmed there was nothing else. We suggested that we talk about it when he was home.\n\nHe arrives home and stays in his room for a couple of days (unprecedented behaviour for him) until eventually I ask him if he wants to talk. Basically, he said his problem was that it was inconvenient to him that we would ask him to be out of the house and that he found it mind blowing that we would think it was an acceptable request. He had run it past other people and they unanimously agreed with him.\n\nIn reply we were pretty firm that we didn't think it was an unreasonable request and that he should have said if he was unhappy so we could work something out that didn't inconvenience him. He said it was the general fact he couldn't come home that was inconvenient rather than the specifics. I know it's not really relevant, but for context his long term girlfriend lives reasonably close by and it's not unusual for him to stay with her. Obviously we would not have asked him to sleep on the streets or get a hotel or something. The conversation ended with an agreement that it came down to a difference of opinion about whether the request was normal and acceptable.\n\nThat was a couple of days ago now, but I have since been feeling rather bitter about the whole situation. I feel like a close friend of both of us should understand our need for some time alone in the brief spells we get together. I also feel extremely resentful about his bitterness towards us, and the fact he was speaking to other people about how unreasonable we are, despite the fact we give him a significant discount on his rent for being our friend.\n\nI have tried to be as unbiased as possible writing this, I hope I have managed to present an accurate picture because I am looking for honest feedback about whether my feelings are justified and whether I should set them out plainly to J.",

She is the loud, sometimes obnoxious, attention loving performer-type and I, the goofy, introverted hermit, emotional artist-type. \n\nThe dynamic of our relationship has always been that I'm there for her whenever she needed me and if she was struggling with something, I was happy to spend however long talking her through it. I'm assuming with as much as I've done for her and helped her out in the past, she felt like she could rely on me. But, it wasn't so much the same for me. See, most of our conversations would always somehow end up focusing on her, even if it was something \\*I\\* wanted to talk about. Still, I considered her as my best friend and even an extended family member for all the events/family dinners she's been at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fast forward...I leave our hometown, move across country a few times, get married. She stays back home, pretty much doing/living the same life before I left. We halfassedly keep in touch while I'm away, and we even organize double dates/hangouts when I'm back home. But, over time, keeping in touch becomes more and more difficult and there's resentment compounding on my end for ridiculously stupid things like \"she never likes my pictures on instagram\", \"she didn't message to ask if I was ok when she saw I was in the hospital\", \"I'm always the one saying hello and she takes forever to respond to texts, yet she hits me up when she needs help with something\", etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo eventually, I got sick and tired of her shit and sent her this text;\n\n \n\nHey dude,\n\nJust wanted to reach out to apologize for being in town for over a week and not getting in touch.

So my idea in being completely honest with you here is so that I have a chance to get it off my chest, give the situation an opportunity to unveil all of the hundreds of other possibilities my one perspective might be missing, and most importantly give this friendship another chance to survive. \n\nI want to be super clear that while this message may seem one sided - it’s just me expressing everything I feel. And, what I feel is all I know. I fully open the possibility of being completely wrong and having misunderstood things. Ultimately, I’m reaching out because I’m not comfortable in making my own assumptions of the truth to a two sided story. How could I possibly?\n\nAnyway, for as long as I’ve been capable, I’ve always done my best to help you. I answered your call when I was on vacation to walk you through Instagram marketing, set up your YouTube ad campaign over the holidays, and have never hesitated to share with you anything and everything I’m doing that has helped me - in order to help you. I never expected anything in return because that’s not why I chose to help. I helped because I thought we had a mutual respect and care for one another as friends and as independent artists. But every time I reached out to say hello, I’d never get a response, and when I did it was super delayed and the excuse was always the same. I became extremely ill right around your birthday but I messaged to wish you a happy birthday but you didn’t respond until a week later, after you saw that I was in the hospital. By the end of all that - you reached out to ask me what happened, I was so tired of not being responded to, that I answered in a way to cut the conversation to avoid waiting for a response that would never come. That made me so sad. And made me wonder if you really cared. \n\nSo, ultimately it was time to go back home for a visit and I was extremely resentful towards you. To me, it feels like I’ve inserted many coins in this friendship vending machine only to feel like I’ve just come up short. You may have noticed that I didn’t mention being busy as an excuse I’m interested in talking about. I know how busy I am and I’m assuming your schedule is no different. \n\nIn all honesty, I wasn’t going to send this at until I played this 30 min exercise / game and it opened my eyes to why I should. (do it on desktop browser to fully understand what I’m talking about). \n\nWhatever happens I feel good about being honest with you. Life’s too short to be angry and I don’t want to keep thinking about it. I will always love you.\n\n\\----------\n\nShe responded by saying she needed time to think things through and that she loved me and respected me...but then turned around to unfriend/unfollow me and she hasn't bothered to reach out like she lead me to believe she would. I feel hurt and used obviously, but the question that wracks my brain constantly is this...Am I an asshole for calling her out? Did I make it impossible for her to want to remedy the friendship? Was I too aggressive? I want to know what I did wrong to warrant her wanting nothing to do with me. It's so f\\*\\*\\*ing confusing. \n\nThx for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I wasn't given a response until October. The paperwork and HR processing took a while, so I only just started working officially a couple of weeks ago. Now, this job I have taken has almost no room for growth and is not the career that I see myself committing to (I had to take it due to circumstances that would preclude me from other job options should I not take this job and get licensed). I aspire to seek a career in research and academia. In an effort to pursue my goals, I applied to PhD programs in December. I did not disclose this to my employers for several reasons: I had still not begun working, there were several problems with HR that threatened my recruitment, so there was a chance I wasn't going to work there anyways, and I did not know the HR processing would take so long, so I thought that if I were to be hired, I would have been able to work for a while before having to leave. The ultimate reason why I did not feel the need to tell them was that never in my wildest dreams did I think I would get accepted. I was applying to a competitive program, in a great school, in a highly sought out location. I honestly did not think I would get in. I was sure I would be rejected, which would give me another year to work with this company. (FYI the reason for thinking I wouldn't get in was not that I was a poor candidate, but rather that I have tendencies for severe underestimation, belittlement, and self deprecation. This is something I am trying hard to improve in myself). But guess what? I GOT IN!!!!! I recently received word that the program was impressed with me and they offered me admission. While I am overjoyed with having the opportunity to achieve my goals, the matter with the job that I just joined is weighing me down. I feel guilty that I will be leaving right after joining them. I hate to give people a bad impression of myself, and I worry that they will think I accepted their offer knowing I would leave so soon just so I can save money until I need to go. The hiring process takes forever, and I feel bad knowing that they'll have to undergo it again so soon right after hiring me. They are extremely understaffed and everyone on the team constantly tells me what a relief my joining was, as it is going to lighten the load a little. I have to tell them soon that I will be leaving them in a couple of months, and I have no idea how I will approach the issue and what I should say. In this country's work culture, people usually hold onto their jobs tightly. It is practically unheard of for someone to quit so soon after being hired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for taking the job, knowing that there was a chance, no matter how small I thought it was, that I would need to quit right after starting?

            "input": "So I recently start hanging out with these two guys who are brothers, Levi and Ian. the same age as me (21) at the time. We become amazing friends and spend so much time together and literally can find any way to have a good time.\n\nBut then there is their best friend, (they have the same best friend) Adam. Adam is 24.\n\nAt first Adam came across as friendly and interested in getting to know me. But then one day when I'm in the car with Adam and Levi, I start going through what I like to refer as a \"lull\" where I don't initiate any conversation and just become quiet but it's kinda like I'm socially spent and I just feel \"low\" and at the time I assumed I was depressed but never went to get it checked out.\n\nWell ever since that time Adam started treating me different. If we were all in a car he would talk and interact with every single person except me, even if I said some kind of comment directed at him. The only time he would seldom \"talk\" to me was indirectly when someone brought up something about me that i did that was funny or silly in a joking way and he would take it more serious and thrown in a passige aggressive remark. \n\nIt was like Levi and Ian didn't see it. And at first I thought I was going crazy and just paranoid and I remember literally telling Ian \"I don't think Adam likes me\" and his response was \"I think he just doesn't know you\". \n\nI never experienced this with Levi and Ian. It was like day and night. It was so fun to be around them that I put up with Adam's behavior, even when it meant he would \"control\" the group and be the person deciding what we would do. \n\nLevi and Ian eventually notice my \"lulls\". It was first brought up with Levi asking me what I wanted the most in the world and I said to be on vacation for a weekend. I hadn't gone on vacation in two years due to financial circumstances with my family, my dad having lost his job of 20 years a couple years back.\n\nThen Levi mentions that his family (middle class like mine but on leaning toward upper middle class) had a cabin in the state just north of hours and says would I be down for going on a vacation and I said yeah that was so nice of him. He says we can plan for the end of the summer (it was late June at this point)\n\nIf becomes evident Adam is going on this trip as Levi sends me details of dates and what to bring. I wondered if this was something I really wanted to do as it's been like going to the dentists office Everytime I'm around Adam no matter how hard I try to be his friend, and I want to be his friend.\n\nSo the day comes and it's like I should have turned back and ran but I didn't the moment I found out we were traveling all in Adam's car and suddenly 20 minutes in the driving of a 4 hour drive I'm regretting coming. It's like they don't see that I'm being excluded from the conversation or that anytime i mention something Adam brings up something that he, Levi and Ian exclusively do (they always hang out together and Adam keeps mentioning how next Saturday they should do this or that and Levi tries to act dumb and says \"Saturday\"? And Adam says we always hang out on Saturday. (Adam is making it obvious he wants me to know that they hang out every Saturday without me and it bothers me not that they do but that he's trying to antagonize me with it) \n\nAnd then we get to the trip. It's hell. \nThree days of doing things I've never done before but Adam wants to do and it's like Ian and Levi don't see it and remain who they are usually but at the same different people in terms of acting oblivious to Adam's behavior and to me it's like I'm the only one who sees a fire but everyone around me doesn't even smell the smoke.\n\nI try to hide my \"lulls\" because I know it will upset Adam. I get quiet and try to collect myself during this hellish time and try to be positive but it's too much. A couple times I put on my sunglasses and wipe tears as I pretend to be readjusting them.\n\nThen the day before the last day of the trip I'm in the room I sleep in in the cabin and Adam comes down stairs and says \"whats wrong /jillerski?\" And I say \"what do you mean?\" And he sits down and motions me to sit down (on the bed in front of him because there are two beds in the room) \n\nHis exact words \"you're like a roller, coaster. You're fun to be around and then ten minutes later you're bringing everyone down.\" And I'm like \"....I'm sorry.\" I feel bad because in general I hate bothering people. He says \"this trip wasn't cheap, and you won't be invited again unless you start getting your act together.\" And I tell him I'm sorry that I've been feeling down because of my family's economic problems and that sometimes I don't feel good and he said \"well just pretend to be happy.\" \"You're starting to bring everyone down and it's ruining the trip for Levi and Ian.\" And I said ok and I smiled and went outside and saw Levi and Ian sitting in the boat (we were gonna go out for the day) and they are acting like two people who are trying too hard to not act like they knew what went down. And we go out and I pretend to be happy the whole trip and smiles smiles smiles. \n\nWhen I get home eventually and I get signal back in my phone (couldn't talk to anyone outside of the 4 of us because I had no signal) I get a text from Ian saying \"I hope Adam didn't say anything that bothered you\" and I just stopped hanging out with them and maybe I am the asshole for ruining the trip they generously provided. And maybe I'm even a bigger asshole for not hanging out with them ever again.",

My mom just hates anything that causes issues with my father. \n\nSo. Low to mid grade discontement on that front most of the time. Recently, we decided to take a three day trip to see two national parks before the new baby arrives. Somehow, pure stupidity I guess, me and my wife had a conversation about who should watch our daughter she had come away thinking we were asking her sister to come down, and I came away thinking we were asking my sister and mother (my Dad is out with work right now). So both parties get asked. A month goes by and the date approaches. The issue comes to our attention. \n\nMy wife has asked my sister-in-law and she has taken time off work and planned travel to come and watch our daughter. My mom and sister are hugely, greatly, to my eyes unreasonably upset about this. My mother doesnt work and my sister is going to college nearby. I make the decision that its too late to call off the sister-in-law plan. So I tell this to my family and they explode. I mean. Three days of phone calls and yelling. My mother won't speak to me. Says I prefer my wifes family to my own. My Dad sent me a text today that says \"Your daughters grandparents lose out to an aunt.\" As if there were some sort of relational hierarchy. I also told them that I think it would be easiest to let my daughter stay the night another weekend and just let my SIL take her this weekend. So not just \"no\" (they were very excited that this was the first time my daughter was to spend the night with them), I did offer a solution as well.\n\nThis is all compounded by my family feeling like we tend to favor her family, which I believe is because we kind of do because we don't fight with them. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR\n\nAccidentally double booked both my Sister in law and mother and sister to watch my daughter for a weekend.

I won’t go too much into this, it’s a long very confusing story/ies, but the point is she says they had sex and after, she felt like she had been violated.

My mom offered them her bedroom so they wouldn't spend $$ on a hotel, &amp; her &amp; I would sleep on the couch, no biggie.

I brought it up as I was grossed out &amp; apparently mom didn't hear them (she was passed out). She's not as bothered about this as I am, probably bc she didn't have to hear it. \n\nAm I wrong for feeling they betrayed home boundaries &amp; were just disrespectful for that choice?

They relied on me a lot and I told them that I couldn't be responsible for them anymore.  The female is a very nice lady that is unfortunately associated with the male. The male has taken advantage of me before and it's only because of the female that I associated with him at all.  They were good friends and roommates. \n\nThey hit some hard times financially and were eventually kicked out of their home for non-payment of rent and I was trying to be helpful and rented them a Uhaul truck with the understanding that it would be returned the next day (Thursday).  \n\nThursday turned into Saturday. Come to find out that they planned to live in the truck until they found a place. Not part of the original plan.  My dad and I went to pick up the truck on Saturday like they agreed but they weren't there. After several phone calls, they promised to meet us at the Uhaul store that afternoon. They never showed and blocked our phone #s and we waited there for six hours. \n\nOn Monday, I got a text that they planned to return the truck on Wednesday, seven days after the initial rental. I was still trying to be reasonable at this point so I agreed. On Wednesday, they said to meet them at their old house on Friday morning. \n\nFriday morning came and my mom and I went there. Surprise surprise, they weren't there. The female called, though, and said she'd had some problems, etc. and that she would return the truck that night and even give me money towards it (I didn't care about that as much as just returning it so the expense wouldn't keep going up).  I told her that if it wasn't returned that evening I would call the police. \n\nFriday afternoon I got a call from the male saying that the female is going to hang on to the truck and it won't be returned that night. He says he is in a different state, though I had reason to believe he is still with the female.  Again, I stated if it wasn't returned that I would call the police. He became very belligerent and threatened to call the police claiming I stole some property I had that was the female's (which she gave me and I have text messages telling me to keep it). \n\nFriday evening, I went to Uhaul to get the necessary information on the truck and then to the police to at least see if a phone call from the police would be enough to spur my friends into returning it. While I was at the police station, the female called me and said that she still planned to return the truck that night, but she had been out looking for places to live and will not return to the truck until much later in the evening.  She seemed very upset over the whole thing and I agreed to await further instructions from her about picking it up.  However, I asked for the location of the vehicle and she claimed not to know. It was parked at a friend's house and she didn't know the street name. \n\nThe agreement was for her to call me in an hour when she got back to the vehicle. I texted her when I hadn't heard from her an hour and a half later.  She said then that she would call me in twenty minutes. That was the last I heard from her.  I called her about thirty times and texted several times with no answer all over the next 12 hours.  \n\nFinally, on Saturday morning (today), I gave her a warning that in an hour, if I didn't hear from her, I was going to follow through and go back to the police. \n\nWhen the hour was up, I called and texted her again with no answer.  I went to the police and filed the report.  Then went to Uhaul and gave them the information. I texted her to let her know that if she returned the truck at night after hours, Uhaul would not do anything to her (that's what I was told). However, if she was caught with it, then she/he would be arrested. \n\nI feel really bad and I hate to see anyone get arrested but I grew tired of the lies.   Am I a jerk?",

I said, \"Sorry about that that\" and moved my foot over yet another entire seat. So now there are two entire seats between his body and my seat. I asked him, \"Does this bother you\"?

He refused to look at me. Now that there was someone sitting in front of me I refrained from putting my feet on the seats. \n\nHowever, after that I went from peacefully enjoying opening day with my BIL to being angry.

I've never been a maid of honor before though. I'm struggling with this situation so far:\n\nSo Becky has already picked out her dress and decided on bridesmaid dresses. We spent an entire day shopping in a city an hour away and deciding on these things. \n\nSince then, she has invited the other bridesmaids and I to go to 2 events with her. The first was a florist visit last month so she could decide on the kind of flowers she wanted for the wedding. I originally said yes I would go, but then she had to change the date of the appointment to a day where I had to work. So I didnt go. \n\nThe second event was yesterday. 3 days prior she had told me and other bridesmaids about this bridal fair she wanted to go to, and asked if we could go. I told her I would have to see how things went because I worked that evening. The event would basically take most of my sleeping time. But whatever. \n\nSaturday night comes along and Becky and I both get invited out to a birthday party of a mutual friend that night. We both had off, and we would see some good friends which included the other bridesmaids, so we all went. Everyone got wasted, most people not making it home before vomiting. I had a good time, things felt good. At the party, Becky asked me again if I would go to the bridal fair the next morning. She begged, saying only a couple of other older family members were going with her. Drunk me felt like Superwoman, so I said sure. Everyone got drunk af and went home. \n\nI went home at 2am, woke up at 5am with a splitting headache and a shit ton of stomach pain. I took ibuprofen and tried to get comfortable enough to sleep. No go. I chugged water. Still felt like shit. Now its 8am and I am extremely nauseous. I hadn't drank alcohol since 1am, I thought I had escaped nausea. My boyfriend was really worried I had something else going on because of the amount of pain I was in, and wanted me to go to the hospital, but I'm in the medical field so I felt like I knew when I would need to go to the doctor. I couldnt sleep still. It was 9:30am. The bridal fair was supposed to be at 11. I texted Becky to tell her I wasnt going to be able to go. I felt like complete crap. I apologized. \n\nI finally vomited, passed gas, and the stomach pains/nausea started to fade. It was 11:30. Becky had opened my message but not responded. I finally was able to fall asleep. At 1pm I woke up to a message from Becky, saying she was extremely disappointed in the fact that I wasnt there for her with the wedding planning. She said I never went to events with her and she would just have to learn to \"lean on\" someone else instead of me. \n\nI'm like...what? I spent a day with her picking out dresses. I am actively planning an expensive bachelorette party because she wants a destination one. I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. It has just been shitty timing for the other stuff. I told Becky this, she said it doesnt change the fact that I've let her down and been a disappointment to her. She then went on to say she doesnt accept my reasons for not going to the bridal fair (extreme nausea and pain). She said every other bridesmaid had messaged her the same thing and she expected more. \n\nI just... I don't know. In my family, you did not have the maid of honor or bridesmaids do shit like this. They help with bachelorette parties and stuff like that. It's just weird to me that Becky seems to expect this much of me and the other bridesmaids. Is this normal though? Am I being an asshole? \n\nTl;dr bride is mad that maid of honor and bridesmaids cant make it to florist meeting and bridal fair. AITA for not being there?",

Inches on the floor, completely soaked my mattress, water stains on my feather duvet and ruined a bunch of things I had stored under my bed. This happened about 2-3 times a week until mid-september (when the tenant above me moved out) and then would happen about twice a month until December (new tenants moved in).\n\nEach time it happened I'd call my landlord who would 'promise' to fix it. I honestly thought he was working as hard as he could to solve this problem. He would go into great detail about all the work he was doing to fix it. One week it was the tenant's sink above me, the next week it was his toilet, for a whole month it was raccoons eating away on the roof. In December I finally went up to the tenet above me and found out it was the shower. Instead of paying for me to stay in a hotel he had me and the new tenants above wait 2 weeks to fix the pipes. This means they had to go somewhere else to shower during that time.\n\nAnyway, I went home and he fixed the ceiling. This stopped the flooding and I was happy...until the next morning. I was woken up at 7am to insane amounts of noise. We're talking vibrations moving down my wall in my bedroom amounts of noise. I could hear everything they did and said: conversations, footsteps, doing their dishes, closing cupboards, shower running through the ceiling.\n\nAnyway, I'm guessing you can guess what happened. When he fixed the ceiling he put absolutely no soundproofing between their floor and my ceiling. It's their hardwood floor, a few feet of dead space and a 10x10 piece of drywall he nailed directly into the wood ceiling frames. Basically, he created a drum that amplifies everything they do throughout my apartment and causes the dishes in my kitchen cupboard to rattle when they walk in the right place.\n\nCue 2 months of my emailing the landlord and him promising to fix the ceiling. We'd set dates and nothing would happen. It took about 2 months for me to stop being an idiot and realize that he had no intention of ever fixing the ceiling so I gave my notice. During this time I've documented EVERYTHING.\n\nFinally, this weekend he nailed acoustic tiles to the ceiling after I told him that they had been keeping me up. When he fixed it, I came home to plaster dust completely covering my bed, duvet cover, floor, pillows. HE had been walking on my mattress while he did it because my duvet was messed up and there was plaster under it on the sheets. He had pushed my bed out of the way and destroyed my hamper and boxes that I use for shipping things I had kept at the end of my bed. I had to spend an hour dusting, sweeping and throwing out the insane mess he made. I was so upset and angry.\n\nSo, redditors, do you think I'd be the asshole?

She might just have the kind of Debbie Downer personality that's a bit overboard at the moment. \n\nWe meet 3 years ago at work. She would often complian about everything.. Work, the country we live in, other people etc. \n\nThen, her best friend left our work place, and after a few weeks of her trying to catch up with her, the friend sends her a text saying that she didn't want to have anything to do with the old work place because she had had such bad experiences there, and just cuts ties with her. She was devastated.\n\nWe become closer..best friends, tell everything to each other kind of thing. \n\n2 years ago she started having doubts about her relationship and complaints that she does everything her boyfriend wants and never gets what she wants. Every time we go out, day or night , he calls , insisting for her to come home.. \n\n1 year and 1/2 ago she meets this guy at work and ends up having a crush.. they see each other twice for coffee.. but nothing happens from there on. Then 1 year ago she meets another guy.. this was worse.. for the first couple of months they declare love for each other... But she ends up saying she will never leave her boyfriend, so ended it with the guy.. she never physical cheated because they live in different countries..but emotional cheating in my POV.\n\n it gets complicated. This guy is super depressed, is in therapy, had has a history of attempting suicide in the past. He's also the type that uses that to guilt people in to things. He's super in love with her, and she just wants to be friends, says they have an amazing connecting, and he's family.. so they still talk everyday.. she hides a lot of the communication from her boyfriend, because she knows it's too much to be acceptable. But since he's so depressed she seems even more  Depressed from being connected to him and enabling this friendship. \n\nI can't help but judge... I've told her she shouldn't keep contact with him after their involvement and because he's still In love and won't be able to get over her if they still have contact. I've only said something over hours and hours of her complaining that he cries a lot because they're not together. \n\nHer boyfriend might not be great.. but I don't think he deserves this.. even if they re just friends now. \n \nWe used to have lunch everyday.. but I've avoided seeing her as much.. I schedule meetings at lunch time. When I do have lunch with her I'm always thinking \"this time will be better, this time she will be in a good mood\".. and then regret it later.\n\nShe used to have other friends, but I'm her only friend now. We used to go to breakfast Saturday morning when I was single. She's told  me she used to be happier because we would go for breakfast and have some laughs, and that now she has nothing in her life to cheer her up. She kind of made my feel guilty for her misery.. which I feel was unfair, and it's too much responsibility to be her only friend.\n\nI can't keep scheduling meetings and giving excuses... I don't like lying.. not even white lies.. but I also can't tell her I can't deal with her, I think it would devastate her.\n\nSo I've blew her off several times by saying I want to have lunch alone, because I need some time - this is true and has happened in the past, she knows I'm introverted and need less social time and has always respected that... But I think with time she will start to feel suspicious because I'm consecutively doing it... She's already asked me if anything is wrong and said I no. Not seeing her everyday has made me so much happier... But as a friend shouldn't I be there for her? Instead of just cutting her out because she's been having a bad time? AITA?\n\n \n",

This decision was made about a year ago when I started dating a guy and found a small friend group I really loved. \n\n       Fast forward to now, she and I have two classes together so we hang out during them like normal. However, whenever I bring up conversation about things I'm interested in or currently working on at the moment (we're both artistic and love trying new medias) she kinda of gives half-assed responses. I get that talking about certain things with no shared interests can kinda be dull, but maybe I'm wrong in thinking she should at least try to sound anything but bored or annoyed? \n\n        Anyway, this isn't just some topics. Every morning now when we see each other, whatever convo we have, if it's something I'm talking about she just gives off this annoyed look. \n\n  I also go to her for advice occasionally, because I have like two friends that are girls while the rest of my friend group are guys. So I go to her for advice on girl stuff, or just life advice because she can be really keen on giving good advice. \n   \n  For the past few months though, when I go to her she again responds with an annoyed tone. She says 'I don't know' or 'Dont ask me' for everything. I get not knowing what to say but when it's said like I'm being an annoyance it pushes me away. \n\n She comes to me for advice too, which I'm fine with. I try to answer with my honest opinion and what I believe is the best advice from my POV. We're both seniors in highschool, adulthood is around the corner. The two of us have matured, however she acts very childish if the advice is not what she wants to hear. She proceeds to get annoyed and just end our conversation right then and there.  \n\n When she's talking about her projects and current happenings I try my best to actively listen and engage with her. But lately I'm not feeling it. If she can't return an small interest in my life hapenings then I just feel that I should distant myself from her, especially after we graduate. I feel like I am working for a good friendship with her while she couldn't care less if I was there or not. I feel like this relationship isn't worth pursuing anymore if it's not mutual. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way and thinking about cutting ties? \n\nTdlr: Friend of 5 years doesn't seem to put effort into our friendship anymore and it comes of that she's wants attention from me but not a mutual friendship. AITA for wanting to cut ties? \n\n\nEdit: So I brought it up and she kinda just tosses the subject to the side like normal. However, she seems to be treating me differently. While it's not all the time, she is listening more and generally being interested in what I conversate with her. She's not completely done with showing indifference and annoyance but I have noticed a difference, which is what I could ask for for a start. \n\n ",

In the ten years since then we've kept in regular contact, but out lives have gone in drastically different directions.

I currently work in the music industry, although not as a musician or songwriter.\n\nMy friend is just kind of doing the same stuff he did when we were young. Can't hold down a job and sits around drinking and watching sports all day. We don't see each other often, but we do talk and I don't really feel like we have much in common anymore. I am not into sports and that's really all he ever wants to talk about. The friendship at this point is based more on our history than any shared interests. A few years ago, I had a death in the family that was very traumatic and this friend completely supported me and talked me through a very dark time.\n\nNow that I am finally settled into my career, I have more time to devote to my personal passions and am ready to channel my energy into some creative projects of my own. I mentioned this in conversation with my friend. In a later conversation, my friend announces he has a great idea and thinks we should collaborate and write music together and try to get it published. I felt really uncomfortable with the idea and just tried to change the subject, but he's brought it up in subsequent conversations and seems to be really excited about the prospect. He's already dreamed up our success as a songwriting duo and has thought about how good I would be it. This friend is not even into music and I feel kind of insulted. I tried to escape the conversation by saying that it's something I would like to pursue on my own, but that was a lie.\n\nI do want to collaborate with someone else I know and have even started a tentative project. This person also has a degree in music and although I've never worked with him in a professional capacity, I know from our personal dealings that he is reliable, hard working, and very creative.\n\nI feel my old friend will feel betrayed if he finds out I am working with someone else, and may even feel like I stole HIS idea.

However, the ensuing shitstorm was NOT the jokes I was expecting, but mostly variants on \"fuck maroon 5.\" It was uuuuuuugly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my moral quandary is this: was I part of the problem, and if so, how much? I got there before the brigade really became a \"brigade,\" but my post certainly could be viewed as actual encouragement to \"burn this place to the ground,\" and really I knew that it was always possible that people would get mean.",

After I've been social in a large group (a.i. Christmas) I need about a day where I'm pretty much alone to rewind. I know this is atypical and I should probably have seen a psychiatrist at an early age, but I never did. This is rarely an issue now as I've learned my limits but things often go wrong when you involve my mom and her side of the family. I'm 18 now and I live with my parents. I see my grandparents pretty often but not my cousin.\n\nSo it was the day after Christmas, me, my mom and my brother were at my grandparent's house with my cousin and as the day progressed I became more and more tired as usual. I got about an hour alone while the rest were on a walk, but I still felt the rudeness show up, so when it came time to discussing whether we would stay for dinner I said I wanted to go home. Mom clearly heard me yet confidently said we would stay. I repeated myself this time expressing how tired I was, but she persisted. \n\nSo I said something like \"fine, then I'll take the bus. Goodbye\" and walked to the front door. Mom chased me and told me something like \"You are going to stay! Think of grandma, grandpa and your cousin.\" to which I replied, somewhat angrily: \"I said goodbye. I can go home when I want and I'm really tired right now. You know how that ends.\" She kept saying that this was going to ruin Christmas as I rushed out the door to the bus stop and the silence of the outside made me think more rationally. I didn't even get of the lawn before I realised that I had the car key so I went back inside to leave it there. \n\nNow my family were going home after all and my mom had railed everybody in the house. I told my mom that they should stay if they want to and I'll go home but for some reason that wasn't an option.\n\nFrom my mom's perspective I know she wants everyone to be together ~~and happy~~ as much as possible and stuff like this makes her really upset. She feels it's my duty to be well mannered and consequently social until she decides it's time to go home. She can't understand why an hour of rest shouldn't be enough to cover a day of socialising. \n\nFrom my perspective she does this so often. With this I mean try to guilt trip me into situations I'm not comfortable being. It's always \"Think of ... and ...! They'll be so sad and it will ruin our entire day!\" in even though the other people have said that I don't have to stay/go if I don't want to. Especially my cousin has stressed that he thinks this is shitty behaviour when we two talk and respectfully taken my side in front of my mom, but nothing has changed.",

He promised we would definetly keep in touch! And I was like cool! Well we did keep in touch for a while. Like ab a couple months. And we would FaceTime. Well I would keep factiming him weekly like we were doing. But he wasn’t answering. I thought nothing at first bc he was Busy and school was starting up again. But then weeks of no answer turned into months. Come to the present now and it’s ab 4 months after Bean stopped talking with me.

You gotta understand that sometimes I feel like nobody cares . Only two people do. BLANK and BLANK It’s like kinda weird since we were such good friends. And sometimes I’ll think what ever happened. We used to hang out during school a lot. Now you won’t even answer my calls or anything. When I look back I feel really sad. But then I feel angry. And it’s weird to feel angry at my friends.

One of my friends, Ryan, must have just gotten an “A” on his political science 101 paper because he was very eager to discuss some recent political hot topics. Not normally a great line of conversation for a casual Friday night, but everyone taking part pretty much had the same liberal-leaning ideology, so it was mostly just everyone nodding and agreeing with one another. \n\nAt one point, the conversation came to illegal Mexican immigrants and how our country should deal with this. I don’t remember how the conversation got to this point, but I said that I am emphatic towards Mexican immigrants, but the least they should do is try and learn English if they want to immigrate here. \n\nRyan and several other mutual friends got fucking PISSED!\n\nThey were railing into me about how “English isn’t the national language of America” and how “I shouldn’t annihilate their cultural identity.” I was so confused because I have zero problem with Mexican immigrants who can’t speak English. IMO, they are always welcome to speak whatever language they want, in public or private, but I just think it is arrogant and displays a high degree of entitlement (especially coming from those seeking out help and a big lifestyle change) if you think the country you’re moving to should adjust their behavior for you.

She doesn't show up to classes anymore, doesn't answer any messages and is being distant. Lisa and I are worried.\n\nMary has done this many times before, ignored us and didn't attend classes at all anymore until something important would come up (i.e. finals) and then she'd be back to normal and behave as if nothing had happened. We know that she is depressed, so we don't push her when it comes to things like this. \n\nBut she stayed silent for a month. I texted her regularily to keep her updated on classes. Around Christmas we all were worried because neither she nor her mother would read or answer our messages and we feared that something bad might have happened to her. \n\nLisa would check on Mary because they lived in the same neighbourhood. In the beginning everything seemed fine, Mary would tell her she was just exhausted. A few days before Christmad however, Mary would close the door on Lisa or not even answer it.\n\nI texted Mary how worried Lisa and everybody was, but she still wouldn't read my messages. Two days before New Year's I decided to call her out on her bullshit.\n\nI know that I could have been more compassionate, but I was really fed up because Lisa would call me daily and cry because she was just so scared for Mary. So I texted Mary that I'm really fed up that neither she nor her mother are answering, that I know she needs time for herself but complete isolation for a month would not help her, at least not in my opinion.

I would have been contend with that and left her alone, but like this her behavior was shitty. I also told her she was hurting me with her behavior, because I was worried sick, imagined scenarios of her being in hospital because she hurt herself or even died doing so.\n\nMary didn't answer until the morning of New Year's. Told me that she was disappointed in me calling her behavior shitty and thought I would understand, she didn't feel comfortable texting me because she thought more of me, then proceeded to accuse me of being at fault for since I should have known she was fine. Said my behavior was wrong and she wasn't sure we could be friends anymore. I apoligized but she wouldn't accept it. Apparently it wasn't her fault she was hurting me but my own for caring.\n\nLater everybody was at Lisa's house except Mary. Lisa was crying again, asking me if I had heard from Mary.

My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn’t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I’ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I’ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship.

I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother’s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I’m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I’m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole?

Found out my dead father isn't my father, it's my godfather who is estranged to us. My mother actually made him my godfather *because* she knew I was biologically his. I suspected for a decade but didn't know till I got the test\n\nBefore my bio father became estranged to us he had a son with his girlfriend. I met the son when he was a newborn. The girlfriend left with the son to another state and my bio father left us to be with her a while later. Didn't talk to him for over a decade. We still don't really talk and I found out the girlfriend became his wife and they're now completely separated. They had two more kids and he's not allowed to see them, so I can't even speak to them through him.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to look the son up since I remembered his name and realized he'd be a teenager. At one point my bio father, who lived with us at the time, was going to seek custody of him. So for a few months I anticipated this kid being my little brother.\n\nShockingly, the kid looks *exactly* like me. His childhood photos look exactly like my nephew. My sister is also my godfather's, we knew that for sure 100% for years. She took her own test and it says we're full siblings. I showed my friends and therapist his photos from his Facebook and they thought they were old photos of me with long hair. We're almost twins.\n\nSo, yeah, the kid is 16 now. He has his own Facebook and Instagram. \n\nI messaged his mother on Facebook to ask her permission to speak to him months ago. I wrote the letter with my therapist and was cordial and delicate considering the circumstances. She never responded. I was heartbroken but understood. \n\nMy mother brought the kid up the other day and said she knows I'm probably sad that I can't have a relationship with my two little brothers and sister. I told her I was going to wait till the youngest is in their 20s before reaching out (that'll be in 10 - 12 years). She said the oldest is 16 and she thinks he's old enough for me to at least PM him to introduce myself.\n\nI'm super conflicted. I don't know this kid and I don't know if he can handle something like this. On the other hand, 16 is old enough to understand. At the end of the day I want him to decide whether he wants me in his life or not, not his mother. Obviously, she can decide that for right now, but when he's an adult he can choose on his own.\n\nMy mother disagrees and thinks 16 is fine. She's under the impression that he probably wouldn't tell his mother and just talk to me. I wouldn't want to do that, however. I don't want to burn bridges or cause unnecessary issues with his mother. \n\nFamily is super important to me, especially siblings. My sisters and their kids are my best friends. Would I be the asshole if I PM'd him despite his mother indirectly telling me no? Should I wait till he's 18 or in his 20s?\n\nAdvice? Has anyone been in this situation before?",

Help would be much appreciated!\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was fairly young, and I've divided my time between both houses since then. I get along famously with my mom (even though she's a helicopter, I love her dearly). But, my Dad and his family is another story. Since I started highschool (about 7 years ago now) he and his second wife decided to work constantly. They own a small business, and want it to succeed. But, they also do a lot of volunteer work (I'm so proud of them for it!) However, this has left the task of running our household on my siblings and my shoulders.\n\nFor a few years, this was fine. In highschool I was always on top of my work, and didn't mind coming home at \\~5 pm to cook dinner, clean the house, do the dishes, study a bit, and go to bed. Between my three siblings and I, we've kept a fairly well functioning house! However, as I've gotten older the demands have further increased.\n\nI'm in my junior year of college now, and commute to a nice school \\~40 minutes away from my household. After I spend 4 hours in classes, I go to therapy for an hour (to help with anxiety), and then work a part time shift for 3 hours. After that, I make the \\~40 minute commute home by train. It's around 5 at night when I finally get back.\n\nImmediately after arriving home, I have to put away the dishes I did the previous night. Then I do whatever chores need to be done that day. Often times I walk to the nearby grocery store to buy groceries for the week. I come home, cook dinner, and by that point it's 8 at night. I quickly eat, and then go to finish up whatever else needs to be done (laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom/kitchen, etc). Overall, I finally start on my homework at around 9 pm, and typically go to bed at 1 am... Only to get up early and start the process over again.\n\nI don't have a problem helping out around the house. In fact, I think it makes me more prepared for when I want my own home! But, I've come to resent my Dad and Step-Mom who decided to offload everything onto us. The tipping point for me was Friday, when they asked me to cover the cost of groceries this month. I'm barely making enough to cover my textbooks each semester, so it's a huge ask. I didn't say anything to them about it, just decided to grin and bare it.\n\nThey snap at me whenever something isn't done. Often times the yelling takes longer than it would take to actually do the chore.\n\nI hate that I'm in charge of so much. My days are long, and they're about to get longer (2 of my siblings leave for college in the summer). I get that they pay the bills, but we're a family and I feel like everyone should pitch in.

She's been a close friend of mine for a very long time, but she was in a relationship for a couple of years and I kept a respectable distance because her boyfriend was crazy. She would reach out to me once in a blue moon to tell me she hated him and felt \"stuck\" within her situation. She would go on to do this until she finally broke up with him. \n\nFast forward to when she told me they had broke up, we started hanging out again.  I knew that she liked me but also knew she needed space because she was freshly out of the relationship. I let her make the \"cues\" first before I made any moves. It started with her cuddling me, then we moved on to kissing, and it got to us touching each other mildly sexually. This was, so far, the limit. She doesn't want sex, any form of it. Of course this is fine with me, although it has been going on for about a month now, and she'll initiate some sexual teasing, which will arouse me, but then she will just stop and refuse sex with me. I'm a man who respects sexual boundaries but it kinda drives me nuts (no pun intended.)  Well after seeing her all this time, I realized it is I who has mostly hit her up to hang out together. I have received some good morning texts from her, and she'll usually text me back when I message her, so I feel like I'm overreacting. But, I hung out with her two days ago and she was really tired from work, so I told her I would leave so she could get some rest. After that, I decided I would wait for her to text me, because I have texted her first for the past week or two. She hasn't messaged me and it just feels like she isn't as enthused as she was at first?

We all really seem to appreciate each other there and if there's a problem for some reason, it's public.\n\nWhen I was pretty new to the job, my co-workers found out pretty early on I was largely an introverted person. I think this has changed a bit, but this make me stand out a lot in the group. \n\nAt one point, my co-workers were calling me the \"school shooter\" for reasons I could only discern as me being introverted. I'm well past high school age and I didn't even stay in college, and I'd never had the intentions to be a shooter. It was certainly a weird nickname for them to give me, but I never did find the reason behind it.\n\nOne day, we were outside in front of customers, and my co-workers were ragging on me as they sometimes do. They were calling me the \"school shooter\" in front of complete strangers. I really didn't like that, and I already didn't like the nickname at all.\n\nAfter we got back inside to our 'office' I began telling the guys how I felt about the nickname and I told them, not asked, to stop calling me that. A couple were a bit taken back, with one of them just leaving the room entirely. In my mind, I think I was justifiably mad about the nickname and the incident. After all, who wants to be called a school shooter?! It just seems so horrible in my mind.\n\nAm I the asshole for ruining my co-workers fun?

I keep on having these guilty feelings I need to ask some people about.\n\n\nSo I had been dating this girl for almost 2 years, we were both 20, young and in love, living in a small one bedroom apartment. We both went on to be diagnosed with depression after the incident and some other earth shattering events. But to the story at hand.\n\n\nWe were in one of those big relationship defining fights. Those fights that last for awhile and emotions come out so raw that our immature minds couldn’t properly comprehend all of it. The crux of it was simple. She was contemplating opening up our relationship so she could “sow her wild oats” in college. I’m as new age as they come but I had a problem with it and wanted to stay a monogamous couple. \n\n\nThe fight progressed and in the end she wanted to take it all back. I couldn’t accept that, I needed to cool off, it felt like my entire world was spinning so I went into the other room to breathe. (It’s a one room apartment so I couldn’t go anywhere). While in the living room I heard the door to the bathroom slam. I heard her yelling about how she doesn’t want to live. I ran to the bathroom door scared.\n\n\nI heard her frantically searching and slamming through the drawers. I heard a loud crack and a cry. Then it repeated, and repeated.\n\n\nThroughout this time I was saying her name asking her to open the door and to stop. The bang and whimpers continued until I backed up and ran into the bathroom door. The door frame was weak and buckled allowing me in (we had a really cheap apartment, think projects level). When the door swing open I saw her hit her head on the wall again.\n\n\nI immediately grabbed her, wrapped her in a weird bear hug type deal and brought her to the bed in the other room. There she laid next to me and cried for awhile. My head was still spinning but I knew I had to do something. I remembered that 9/11 in our area allowed texting. While she was laying down sobbing I quickly texted 9/11 our location, the situation and to please hurry.\n\n\nMy rational at the time was that she just seriously attempted to hurt herself. As selfish as it sounds I was nowhere near capable of handling the situation alone.\n\n\nThe police came, they talked to us apart. Took us in squad cars to a local hospital where she was admitted to a psych ward after a review. \n\n\nAfter talking to my friends on the matter I was told that I may have handled this wrong. I was informed of the terrible realities of inpatient care. As well as the stress it puts on a person going through a bad times. I feel like shit for hurting her.\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR:\nGirlfriend and I had a big fight over the state of our relationship. She locked herself in the bathroom and hurt herself. I broke in the bathroom and stopped her. Contacted the police and she ended up in inpatient care. \n\n",

I had an ok relationship with my parent who I don’t live near, lets call them parent #2 but it was a very stressful. My parents split was very messy and parent #2 alway tried to make it a pick parent #1 or me and was always pushing to spend every moment with them. I understand that they just have me and my sibling, but I also had to deal with the burden of constantly making me feel like I was guilty for any decision I made regarding time spent with parent #1 or parent #2. Parent #2 also argued that they didn’t have to support me if I didn’t see them enough and since the day I turned 18 even when I still saw #2 on an almost daily basis they did not support me financially. \n\nAfter moving I was basically pressured into visiting once after only 3 months even when I had a visit planned for about six months out. Well not parent #2 wants me to keep up a 3 month routine and honestly I don’t want to see #2 that often. #2 just always makes me feel like crap and pressures me into things I don’t want to do. Now don’t get me wrong I still like #2 but its just shitty to be pressured to do everything. They act like they give me options, but I know that the options aren’t really options. I’d be more than fine if #2 wanted to come visit me, but I’m tired of flying across country and taking off time (over a week each time) from work every 3 months. When I split my time almost 50/50 between my parents life was hell because I had to constantly listen to the bickering. It wasn't everyday, but it would got to the point of me having to leave the house a couple of times out of fear or anger. There were many good times during those years, but many taxing days as well.\n\nTo understand my situation a little better I’m a full time student and work 40 hours a week so I’m busy, but I like it and still want time to do my own things. I guess I might be selfish, but at this point I don’t know. I also don’t want to disagree with parent #2 because there parents have a college fund for me that will pay for a half of year, which is a lot of money for me. It almost feels like I just have that pressure of money looming over me. Plus I still love a lot of my family on that side, but its just tough because I don’t want to upset them by making parent #2 upset and they won’t see it my way, they never have but they don’t hold it over me.\n\nSo I ask, am I the asshole for not wanting to see #2 every 3 months? Also should I good see #2 or should I stand my ground?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go way further in depth with the stories, but I don't want to be too specific.",

We both have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, so we can’t go super fast and we have to take a lot of breaks, but we can swim at a perfectly decent speed which usually isn’t a problem.\n\nThe pool we swim at has three lanes: one lane has a parent and toddler class on a Saturday morning so it’s out of bounds. The second is an adults and children lane, and the third is adults only. My sister and I were swimming in the adults lane when a man came in who was swimming much faster than us. And he wouldn’t stop at all between laps. It quickly became impossible for my sister and I to swim in the lane, because every single time we started, he’d catch up to us and we’d hold him back. He made it very clear we were getting in the way, saying excuse me and knocking into me a few times (I think on purpose but I’m not sure). He also seemed to get annoyed by us taking breaks and standing at the end of the pool, even though we tried to keep out of the way. He also wouldn’t keep in line, he was kind of zigzagging across the lane trying to overtake everybody. It was a nightmare.\n\nEventually he got our attention and said to us: “Excuse me girls, this is the ADULT lane, and it can be quite fast. Maybe you’d be better suited to that lane” (points to the children’s lane). This pissed me off for two reasons. Firstly the other lane was completely full and nobody was following the rules about swimming clockwise, so it would be completely impossible for us to swim there. Secondly, I look a little young for my age but I’m clearly not a child, and the way he talked to me was very condescending. I didn’t want to make a scene so I just gave him a kind of grimace smile and continued swimming in the adult lane. We ended up getting out a few minutes later though, because it was so annoying. \n\nAITA for not moving? I’m genuinely not sure because as much as my sister and I are entitled to swim there, he is too and we were slowing him down quite a bit. But I don’t want to feel like I can’t swim in a shared pool just because of one person. I’ve been wanting to bring my blind friend swimming with me but now I’m worried that people will get annoyed with her too, and she can be quite easily upset if she thinks she’s inconveniencing people.",

I moved out before they moved in, and right now I'm back home from college for spring break.\n\nMy BIL brought his dog with him when he moved in with my sister two years ago. Both he and the dog came from an abusive household and she was definitely the worse for wear. She had open wounds from other animals and was extremely anxious about just about everything. She seemed to be recovering for awhile, but her cuts got infected despite treatment, and earlier this year she started on several rounds of intense antibiotics. We've spent thousands of dollars on tests and treatments at this point. Nothing has worked so far, and at present she is stuck in a Cone of Shame with the injuries from two years ago still open and she's lost so much weight she's basically a skeleton. None of the vets have really given a prognosis, but at this point it's hard to imagine her recovering.\n\nI adore this dog. She's incredibly sweet and loving despite everything she's been through, and she's always happy for someone to snuggle her. I'm an animal lover and would be typically happy to oblige, but... I'm also incredibly squeamish and can't handle gore of any type, ESPECIALLY on animals. Looking at her back makes me gag. Like I said, these are two-year-old infected injuries. They're not pretty. We've tried covering them up with doggy t-shirts, but that just ended with blood- and pus-soaked shirts and a minor rash from the friction of the cloth.\n\nLike most dogs, BILs is always on the hunt for soft places to sit, and my bed has become one of her favorites. I sleep with my door closed so I typically move all of the animals out before going to bed, so as to avoid accidents and whatnot. By now I've resorted to having my mom move her away to one of the sofas, sister and BILs room, or anywhere else soft before I go to sleep. I feel like such a jerk for taking her away from where she wants to be when she probably doesn't have long left and should just be petted for hours on end and let sleep wherever the hell she wants. But at the same time, I don't want to worry about kicking her or rolling on top of her in my sleep, or to wake up to find that her cuts are bleeding or oozing again, that she's had a bathroom accident, or worst case scenario, that she's died. I personally didn't sign on for the responsibility of having any dog, much less one this sick, and I don't really think it's fair to myself to force myself to deal with it head-on. But I still feel like the worst person in the world because she deserves any small pleasure she can get at this point and I'm taking that away just so I can starfish when I sleep.\n\nNo one has called me an asshole for this, but man, I feel like one.\n\nSo, AITA for kicking a sick animal out of a soft place?",

Surviving with basically no money isn't exactly new to me... \n\nTo give some more insight into This:\n\nwe both are on the same kind of disability, usually get the same amount of money per month, around 900e. \n\nWe live separately, have separate money, everything. She doesn't live at my place technically, but she does spend most of Her time with me, and stays at my place almost every free night we have. \n\nWe are both students (the disability we get paid is tied to our studies, so if we don't get courses done, we don't get money. It is thing Where I live). \n\nwhile we have separate finances, we do live a quite symbiotic life what Comes to spending money on food and such, so while Her debt isn't my debt, it does affect me, and how much money I have to spend on other things. \n\nSo, AITA for expecting Her to use the money she is getting to pay most of the debt Immidiately, instead of the Monthly payments?\n\nPs. Before I start getting monetary advice, thank you, but no need. We have contacted multiple organizations that provide free professional consultation for situations just like This one. I'm sure that if there is a better way to do This than what I Came up, they'll tell me about it. ",

Out of them, 3 were actually very important to me; one of them was even my BFF. \n\nIt's the same story for all of them. Friend needs something so they call me for help. In most cases, it's something like babysitting their kids while they go out, or driving them somewhere when they need a ride. Many times though, I have also helped them moved, have cleaned their houses for them when they couldn't, and even allowed them to live with me when they couldn't live at home. \n\nAnd I'd run, every single time someone needed me, I'd be right there for them.\n\nMy \"awakening\" happened a few years ago when one day, my daughter simply asked me if my BFF and I weren't talking anymore. I wondered why she'd think that and she told me it was because my BFF never liked or commented on anything I posted on social media. I had never realized that up to that point, so I started paying closer attention. Sure enough, any of our friends posted something, she'd love it, comment it or whatever. Nothing whenever I posted something. She even ignored my comments on her own posts, while liking/commenting everything else others wrote.

I did not realize the cat was as old as she was when I took her and her age quickly started to show. She only moves to eat and use litter box.  The rest of the time she rests in one spot.  That’s it.  Very sweet cat but she’s like a living fixture in my house. \n\nWhen I was first dating SO, one of the earlier important questions I asked was if he was ok with cats, if we/I could have a cat down the road if we live together.  He said yes.  He said yes because we were newly in love and we were enamored with each other and I badly wanted a cat and although he’s an anti-cat guy he said OK.  I already had a cat, but I know she is old- I’m asking about another cat. \n\nAnd after a couple of years cat discussions came up and he changed his position on cats. He hates cats, he’s allergic (even though I’ve never seen him have an allergic reaction when he’s over at my place with my cat), says cats are horrible and murderous, they kill for sport, cats stink, litter box stinks, they don’t love their people etc etc etc.   And he took back his agreement to have a cat.   He now says NO CATS when we live together. \n\nThe subject of moving in together has come up  and we have been looking at places and without any particular rush are planning on living together, that’s the long term plan. \n\nNext thing I know, my teenager comes home with a kitten.  Now- I didn’t go LOOKING for this kitty. Neither did my teenager who just found it, it was dumped and starving.  So we fed the kitten, knowing we couldn’t keep it but just helping until I can get it to a rescue for her forever home.  I didn’t mention it to SO because we had other things going on and it was temporary anyway.  In hindsight- probably should’ve mentioned it.   ..... SO comes over and learns there is a kitten here.   I tell him the cat is not staying (even though of course I do want to keep her) I’m going to send her to rescue.  He says “No No No No- I know you want that cat your kids are in love with that cat it’s already been here and you guys are attached to the cat. So absolutely DO NOT get rid of that cat because you will be making me the bad guy and no thank you to that. The kids will know it was me who spoiled it and made you get rid of the cat.”  He was piiiiiiissed.  But told me not to get rid of the cat. \n\nSoooooo I kept the cat.   But he couldn’t sleep and was so upset because he took this as a HUGE sign that I don’t want to live with him since he said he wouldn’t live with a cat and now here’s cat that will be around for a long time. When this came up in an argument a month or so later, and I reminded him that he told me to keep the cat that he did not want to be the bad guy or make my kids upset that they had to part with the kitten.  He told me I should’ve known better and that I was supposed to go ahead and not keep the kitty of my own accord, not because he told me to.\n\nGreat when he tells me this NOW, after we are all really and truly attached to the cat and after the cat is very attached to us.  She loves and trusts us very much.   I’m reluctant to even try and rehome her now. This is her home. And I love her. I know I should’ve discussed this with SO more as it’s a big decision that affects us both in the event we live together.  And I do want to live together. I just want him to accept a cat like he said he would.  It’s JUST a cat. Its not a sign that I don’t love SO or want to live together. \n\nNow SO is so mad. He doesn’t want to come over. He’s pissed all the time about me getting a cat.  It’s almost getting worse.  The more he thinks about it, the more upset he is and it’s snowballing into a huge thing.  Also he flat out said he will NEVER EVER EVER live with a cat.  He wants to live with me 100%.  This is not him looking for an excuse not to live together. He does.  Just not with my cat.  \n\nHonestly ..... I love this cat. I really do. It’s important to me.  So important that it was one of the few questions I ask in the beginning of a relationship. Dealbreaker questions.  And for me a cat is one of those questions.  \n\nI understand how he feels.  ***He feels like I chose this cat over him. Over his feelings. Over our relationship.  And he’s very very butthurt.***\n\nBut it’s JUST A CAT.  I get it. He doesn’t like cats.  I wish he would get over it and do this for me.  He wishes I would get rid of the cat for him.   I told him, it’s fine you don’t have to live with a cat.  He said Neither do you.  \n\nI think he should accept the cat because it means so much to me.  Just deal with it it’s not the worst thing in the world. He thinks I don’t care about his feelings and that I should not have a cat because it means so much to him. \n \nAITA?\n\n",

I told him that I would like to wait and see what becomes of the project first for two reasons. First is that I like to know everything when going into something or at the very least remove most variables when approaching something. His idea is very open-ended and he didn't do a good job explaining what he has in store for the project. Secondly, I just didn't find the premise all that enticing and I wasn't too sure how far he was willing to with the project itself. He is the type of guy who likes to have a lot of different things happening at once. But I don't know if this will be a project with a future or something that falls to the way-side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo further my second point I have to give some context. He told me that he would like me to help him on another project, a book he is writing. He asked for me to read the first chapter of his book and give him my thoughts and criticisms. When I read about 3 out of the 15 pages I gave my honest opinions about something I found weird about the book or inconsistencies in the narrative. After I explained these to him, he simply told me about another book idea he had, instead of addressing my issues with his original story. I asked him if he wanted me to continue reading and critiquing his story and he said yes. So I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later I was on a phone call with him and the conversation shifted to his website idea. That was when I got more of an idea on what he wanted to do. Basically, he was going to interview some people that he met through college. Then he would post the interviews and maybe have a forum where people could discuss their opinions about the topic of his website. I told him that's cool and I am glad he has some sort of vision. Then I asked \"what about after that though\" like what is his end goal with the website. He kinda got offended a bit by saying that people from my state are not go-getters and people always focus on the endgame of projects. He went on to say he thinks people in other states are more quick to jump on board with a project as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got around to reading his story, and so, took about an hour or so reading it, re-reading it, then making side notes on google docs for him to look at. I messaged him and asked him if he thought my critiques were well thought out. He then tells me that he is doing research for yet another project and that he would look at my list of side notes later. It kind of ticked me off a bit that I spent my time to help him yet, because he was preoccupied with other things, he didn't take the time to look over my notes for his story. And still hasn't contacted me about his story idea to this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently he has contacted me again to ask for help on his website. He is using Wordpress to design his website.  He knows I have a lot of free time, seeing as I am unemployed, and that I have some knowledge with computers. He, on the otherhand, does not understand how to use it nor is he that computer savvy. He basically wants me to learn how to use Wordpress and teach it to him. He does preface this by saying, \"if you want to\" and that I would be doing him a huge favor. The only problem is that I turned him down before and he has literally done nothing to convince me on his premise or that he will see this project through. ",

No problem with that in itself.\n\nMy flatmate is a great friend of mine - we spend a lot of time together, cook together, share shopping, etc, and I love this arrangement and I know he does either. \n\nThe issue is that this girl has been staying for an increasingly ridiculous amount of time. The first couple of times she has stayed for reasonable amounts of time that I have no issue with, such as long weekends. However, the last couple of times she came down she stayed for 5 days, which though I wasn't too happy about I let slide as it wasn't too different to her usual 3 or 4, but the next time she stayed for a total of 10 days/9 nights. \n\nI was livid, and ended up feeling forced out of my own flat for the majority of that time. Most of the reason I was pissed off was that she was eating my food, drinking my drink etc, without offering a penny towards me, or even a simple thanks! Personally I would offer money or at least bring a bottle of wine as a thank you, at the very least say thanks, if I was even staying at someones for the night let alone the next 10 days.\n\nIt doesn't help that we don't really get on either; she is jealous of the relationship that my flatmate and I have, and even though there is nothing romantic about it at all, she seems to try her best to keep us apart the whole time she is at our flat. I wouldn't say I was jealous of her but her presence does irk me; I'm a creature of habit and her being there fully disrupts my meal routine as my flatmate and I can't cook for each other as normal. However, I stress that this last point wouldn't bother me if she wasn't so rude to me in my own home. \n\nAnyway, he didn't tell me about her coming until the day before she did, when I told him that she wasn't welcome for that long in our flat, especially not without asking me or any of my other flatmates about it. An extra person in our already small flat was a lot to handle, and it meant that we had to have predrinks in our bedrooms/eat in our bedrooms as we didn't feel comfortable being a 3rd party to them. He basically told me it was none of my business.\n\nProblem is, I couldn't just let it go - I'm a student so I'm not exactly wealthy, I certainly didn't want to fund somebody else. My flatmate promised me we'd work out something regarding money for the food she'd eaten. \n\nAfter the 10 days elapsed, it transpired neither of them were planning on giving me any money. He said they'd done the groceries, but they had only bought at most around 10 pounds worth of veg, most of which they'd eaten. He told me this was fair and couldn't do any more as he was low on cash. My argument is if neither of them could afford the extra money, she shouldn't have come for 10 days.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

His house was a house on a street corner and my dog decided to poo on the side in the gutter, so he had to poke his head around the side of his house and over his fence to even see me.\n\nI apologised and told him my situation and that I didn’t plan on running out of poo bags but he wasn’t having a bar of it. His tone was kinda like the one you hear before a asshole would break your nose and I didn’t want a fight so I asked him if he had a plastic bag I could borrow. Then he said for me to empty my groceries from the plastic bag I was using and pick it up with that. I told him I could for the obvious reason I wouldn’t be able to carry my groceries but then he threatened me that he’d come down to me and force me to use the groceries bag.\n\nThat’s when I had the pretty shitty idea (no pun intended) of emptying the biscuits I brought for snacks later and used the wrapper for them to pick it up. Satisfied, he walked back into his house.\n\nI recognise that what I did could go on r/trashy if I plan for it, but I didn’t, so am I the asshole for letting my dog poo outside this guy’s house in a gutter or is the bald guy the asshole for going out of his way to threaten me unless I ruined my groceries?",

He drifted in and out of my life going to jail multiple times and when he seemed to be doing well he’d fuck up his life drink and get violent with his SO. About two years ago he re-entered my life and the first time I saw him in over 3 years he was blackout drunk with my older brother driving him around. He then would message me on Facebook with deadens conversations that went no where ie. “how are you?” “I’m good”. He would send me various messages and got to the point where he’d send weird photos one of which was a nsfw woman that had be burned. \n\nWith all of this context he recently started called my phone number, I’m not sure how he got it again.

I would ignore his calls if it were slightly inconvenient for me to pick up and wouldn’t bother calling back. \n\nMost recently he helped me out. My cars clutch had given out on me and he called me the same day and I told him about it. He offered to fix it if I get the parts. And so he does and was working on it in the rain. He does the job in two days and I get a newfound respect for him. Money was not mentioned by me or him. That following weekend he asks if I wish to go to a baby shower with him I agree to go and on the way there he has me stop asks me for $5 and goes around a corner and buys alcohol without my direct knowledge. He proceeds to drink to the point where he’d doze off. We arrive at the party and I meet some extended family where most people that know him are fully aware that he’s drunk. The situation is extremely uncomfortable for me and I’m forced to babysit him and take him home afterward. \n\nAt this point the little respect I had for the man is crushed and I’m contemplating blocking his number as he calls me every two days to check on me sometimes sober most times drunk.

So putting gas in your tank became an overnight problem. I travel 50 kilometers a day for work and finding a gas station that's not empty is a real challenge. You basically have to rely on word of mouth and pray you get there in time to fill up.\n\nAnyway last week end i got word that some gas station located 15km from where i live still had gasoline. So i get there as soon as possible only to see the worker closing off the gas station. I headed to the nearest station that had gasoline but E10 was all they had left. It's a mix with 10% ethanol only recommended for cars built after 2000, mine is from 1997. Since I had no choice I put 20 liters in my car, it's a small car with a 40 liter tank, enough to last me a week if I drive carefully.\n\nThe next day after finishing work I drove by a gas station on my way home, and to my surprise it was packed with people waiting in line, so I joined the fun. My turn came and there was a notice saying that due to the current situation, the pump is locked to 10 Euros per customer (not even liters, go figure). So I put my credit card in and finally got some real gasoline. Now normally I would stop after one serving but since I had E10 in the tank I wanted to limit the damage it could do to my engine by mixing it with as much gasoline as possible.\n\nThe pump automatically stopped when it reached 10 bucks so i put it back in place and proceeded to put my credit card in once again. Typed my code and the delivery started again, that's when some old dude 50, 55 got out of his car and started yelling at me: \"You don't have the right, it's limited by law (the moment I knew I was dealing with some sheep who believes everything he sees on TV), that if everyone does that there will be none left for the rest of us!\".\n\nI kept looking at him with a blank expression while taking gas. I wanted to tell him \"I'm taking your share!\" but I didn't. Seeing I didn't care he said he took my plate and he will call the cops on me to which I replied \"Do it\", and he angrily got back into his car. I didn't care because it was limited only by the gas station and not by law, even though there was some instance where it was.\n\nSo reddit, do you think I'm an asshole?",

Even before I was old enough to drive I would take the bus to see them.

When I realized that none of them could make it I was actually a little hurt, but I understood. I was miffed that some of my cousins whose wedding's I had gone to responded in the negative.\n\nWhen I got married I was in grad school and living within proximity to them and saw them regularly. I flew home to get married and some of their parents were in attendance and my mother's side of the family, who I'm not close with, attended. I did see that they'd posted on my FB. When I was around my family no one said anything to me about it. Literally nothing except from some uncle who my aunt was in the process of divorcing. What I took from this was that if they weren't going to make the effort to have a relationship than neither was I. Apparently they noticed this and one of their parents reached out and asked why I was being distant and if I planned on approaching my cousins about what was bothering me. I told her that I wasn't necessarily being distant and that my interactions with them were as much their responsibility as mine and that if there was something bothering them, that they could reach out to me. She implied I was being ungrateful and I just left it at that. I was around them a handful of times and they always left me alone. One of my cousins did get drunk and apologized about not RSVPing and I told him that I appreciated his apology but that I thought our relationship had meant more, he said that it did. I ultimately told him that what he was saying didn't line up with how he was acting and that I was no longer willing to carry our relationship. We said goodbye in the morning and he texted me once when there was a natural disaster in my area. I didn't respond.\n\nEventually one of my cousins did send us a wedding present, and I was very grateful and wrote a card thanking them and I do respond to their texts.

When I order, I always order several of the extra cups or sauce. I don't expect it for free, I'll gladly pay for it if I can get the dinner i want. I use a lot of sauce on my food and also keep extras in the cabinet for home cooking and when they forget my sauce. I'm not gonna be an asshole and make them drive back to the store and back to me all for 1 garlic sauce for no extra tip, but after a while I get tired or having my order wrong.\n\nThe problem is, over 50% of the time they miss one or more of the extra sauces I paid for. Even after I ask the delivery person if they got all the sauces, they will still be missing or wrong. It got the point to where I've called the store and talked to the manager, he assures me it won't happen again and it does. So I started telling the drivers the next time they forget my sauce they won't be getting a tip. Now I used to be a driver too, so I know sometimes you forget things or the person on cut table didn't put the sauce in the box like they said they did. So I started putting in the driver instructions that I won't tip them if they forget my sauce. Nothing else I say or do seems to help. So last night, it happened. I ordered 11 extra sauces. I ask the driver when he gets there if he got all my sauce, he hands me a bag. Normally that's where I tip them but after getting it wrong so many times, I have to check. So I open it and check them, not only is the total count short by 2, missing 1 of the marinara cups and the only cup of icing for the dessert, all 4 cups that were supposed to be mango habanero were instead ranch that I ordered zero of. So out of 11 sauces I ordered and paid for, I only got 5 of them correct. \n\nBeing an ex driver myself, I didn't want it to come to this. But it had gone too far. I handed him back the ranch that I didn't order and told him I won't be tipping because the sauces were wrong yet again and that next time if they wanted a tip, my order should be correct.\n\nTLDR. I always order and pay for extra sauce with pizza, they have gotten my order wrong so many times I won't tip anymore if even 1 item is wrong or missing. Am I The Asshole?\n",

For the most part we all get along well and respect each others privacy and space.\n\nAugust of last year we informed RM we are planning on buying a house no later than end of this lease (August 2019).I've been keeping RM in the loop with our home buying process on any potential homes. I asked if 60 days (notice we have to give apartment leasing company and term of rent that needs to be paid) was enough time for her to get a new place? She said yes- I also offered to put in the 60 day notice later, effectively buying her more time to search for a place as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, I told my RM I think we are about to go under contract on a potential home and that SO and I would pay for any termination fees and of course our portion of rent/utilities during the 60 days. Asked RM if she needed more than 60 days to find a place, she said no, she was planning on moving into a 1bd/1bth in the same apt. \n\nOn Thursday the home deal fell through and we are back on the market so I informed our RM that we were back on the search. She said that she was planning on going to the leasing office tomorrow to sign a contract for mid April for her own place. She asked to be let out of the lease and obligations here as she wants to just get the move over with. I discussed with SO and we agreed that we could cover her portion of rent starting May. I inform roommate we would cover her portion of rent beginning May, but that she would still be responsible for her portion of March &amp; April rent/utilities, to which she agreed.\n\nYesterday RM goes to the leasing office to sign her lease. I get back home from work and calculate out how much her April rent/utilities are and inform her for the power bill I would let her know once I got the bill. She responded back 'ok'. 15 min later, I get a text from RM who said she doesn't think its fair that she should have to pay rent for a month that she wont be here. She gets home &amp; she informed me that she signed a lease for mid March for her own place, because the leasing office offered her a \"better deal\". I asked her wasn't she planning on moving mid April, why did she sign for mid March? Her response was because of the better deal and she wanted to just get it over with. I told her I would need to discuss with SO and see if we could let cover her portion of rent for April. I point out to her that even if SO and I closed on the house, everyone would have had to pay the apt for the 60 days of rent (March &amp; April) for the apartment.\n\nAfter much discussion, SO &amp; I agree that it's unfair for us to become burdened with her portion of rent for April just because she wanted to move out earlier and signed a contract without informing us. I also point out that she had no intent of signing for March, it was April. I let RM know our decision and the conversation did not go over well.",

Out of all the things that I wouldn't want to do it's probably in the top 10. Anyway,  up until this semester I've probably had to give dozens of presentations in my other classes. With those it wasn't that bad tho because they would typically be group presentations or short 5-7 minute ones.  I could handle them.  This year I had one that was different.  It would be a 10-20 min presentation all by yourself ( and 40% of final grade). Additionally, the presentation could be any format that you wanted as long as you met  the time requirement.  This is where I made my plan. \n\nNow most people did something simple like a PowerPoint and would just read off of it hoping that they were able to reach the 10 minute mark,  not me. I made a trivia game for the class to play. I should also note that every night for homework we are assigned some reading from the textbook to do, most people don't,  I knew this. That chapter in the textbook is where I got most of the questions for the trivia. \n\nNow I had a few reasons for going with trivia.  For one it would have been more interesting for the rest of the class if they could interact with it rather than just sitting there trying to stay awake during a PowerPoint.  It would also work as a review for the final coming up since it is also largely based on the textbook. These were not my primary reasons for doing trivia tho.  I knew trivia would take the professor's attention off of me since I wad presenting and put it on the rest of the class since all the answers were right in the reading that no one did.  It was also so much easier to reach the time limit when the thing that took the longest wad just the silence caused by other people not knowing the answers. Also most presentations end with the rest of the class asking the presenter questions but not mine,  I asked the questions. \n\nWhen I told my roommate about it he said that I was \"the worst kind of person\" which I understand get is a bit facetious but it's still completely possible that I'm an asshole (I will 100% do it again if I can tho). All I did was take a gamble that people didn't read and it worked out. If they had then my presentation would have only been like 5 min and I would have been SOL. \n\nSo am I am asshole for doing this or was I in the right and just used the rules of the assignment to my advantage?

I also later found out he had been stealing from us as well. \n\nAs any sane person would, I kicked him out of my home. I tried to file for a divorce, but my wife went through an awful depressive episode, lasting almost a month. I dropped the ideas about a divorce. \n\nFor a while, things seemed to go back to how they were when I was 20. Things were going great at work and I was climbing the ranks. We’d just moved into a new house closer to my work. My wife had begun branching out and now owned two or three shops in the city. She was on a new medication that made her a much more pleasant person. Our sex life was great. \n\nAnd then we found out she was having a baby. I was ecstatic - I love kids. My wife and I had always wanted a kid, but every time we’d tried it hadn’t worked. Soon enough, our son was born. \n\nOver the course of his first couple of months, I began to have doubts that he was really my son. I put this off as first kid worries or whatever and continued with my life. Until one evening, my wife sat me down and told me the kid was my brothers. Her reasons were that ‘she knew I’d always wanted a kid’ and that ‘our DNA was too close for it to make a difference’. Never mind the fact that meant she was sleeping with my brother again. \n\nAgain, I distanced myself. I tried to file for a divorce again, but my wife returned to her depressive state, so once again, I dropped it. One night after an argument, I left the house with no intention of going anywhere and ended up in a bar. I got talking to a girl and we had a one night stand. \n\nI couldn’t help but think of my wife the whole time, and yet a week later I slept with her again. She told me things about herself - she was living with her cousin, she worked two jobs to put herself through uni, she felt like she was alone in the world. Our one night stand became a whole relationship and I realised that I was cheating on my wife. \n\nIt became a lot easier when I made her my secretary. I don’t want to explain many details about our relationship. She was by no means at fault. I didn’t tell her I had a wife until a month or so before I gave her the job. I didn’t tell her about my son until our first argument. \n\nI was spending a lot more time at work, and my wife began getting suspicious. She stopped taking her meds, telling me they ‘clouded her thoughts’ and refused to speak with her psychiatrist. Still, she doesn’t know about the other woman. \n\nReally, I know I am at fault for a lot of this, and a tragic backstory or whatever doesn’t let me off. But I really do think I’m in love with the woman I’m cheating with and I don’t know what to do.\n\nTLDR: my wife, who suffers from multiple mental illnesses, has put me through numerous hardships and now I’m cheating on her. Am I the asshole?",

I noticed that she was a bit overly happy and perhaps a little clingy, but I first figured that was just her personality so I did not pay any mind to it. So only a few minutes after meeting her, she wanted my snapchat information. I figured it wouldn't hurt anyone so I just gave it to her and we exchanged info. After the prom, she started sending me about 3-4 snapchats everyday. Some of them didn't even make sense, like just her drinking a starbucks or something. I did not know how to respond to these so I would just go like \"haha\" or something. I would also get random DMs from her saying like \"just broke up with my bf\" and like a crying emoji. Again, I don't really know how to respond to something like that. I had subtle thoughts that maybe she was into me or something but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and just thought that maybe she just had an eccentric but harmless personality, so I would just respond to everything she wrote to me with like a laughing face or a thanks. She then responded to a picture of my dad from when he was my age saying \"now I know where you get your good looks from. \" Again, I just responded laughing and saying thanks.

She has been doing this for two years now until I pretty much put a stop to it last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor halloween, I posted a picture of me dressed up as Buddy Holly. Not too long after, she DMed me saying \"OMG you are so cute pls be my bf.\" Hoping that she was joking, I just laughed and said that I was glad that she liked the costume.

She wrote back saying \"I am guessing you are not available then :(\" I just told her that I couldn't and then blocked her after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole for blocking her but the reason this situation made me so uncomfortable is because I barely even know who this girl is and the only time I ever actually met her in person was for that 5 minutes.

To start off in the 4th grade they left a cult, a cult I still believed in, I didn't really have anyone to talk to at the time, so I resorted to the internet to help me work through what I believed. At this point I didn't really see my parent's as a role model. They also had me during college, a decision I am certain they now both regret, so I feel partially responsible for them being stuck with a kid they don't want. In the 6th grade I was being an ass, making fun of my dads friend, thinking that neither him or I was taking it seriously, unfortunately  I didn't know I was being an dick until I heard my dad call me an ass after I left the room. This type of scenario happened again with my mom. She was complaining about me and my siblings not helping out as much as we should. I got mad and said that it was her job to clean  up after us, I know I was the asshole in the scenario, unfortunately I didn't know how much of a dick I was being until my dad came home. I heard her crying to my dad in their room, and I started feeling really bad about it. A few minutes later my dad came into my room and asked me \"why are you being such an ass to your mom\".  It is because of these events, and many little ones, that I am very reserved around my parents, I think they are going to talk about me behind my back. I also feel like I can't rely on my parents emotionally, so I have been resorting to the internet and myself for advice/emotional support since the 6th grade. This has matured me, greatly, and I would argue that I am capable of making thought out and mature decisions, as I couldn't rely on them to make these decisions for me. (as in setting rules, giving advice on what I should do, ect.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so jumping too present day. On Christmas we go to a friends house, a couple hours into the event my mom and her friend go outside to, I later figure out, smoke a cigarette.  Now I am fine with that, I have no right to judge what she does, and as long as its not a repeating thing I don't really think its a health issue. However, I am not allowed outside during this time, as she probably doesn't want to set a bad example for me. (keep in mind I don't consider them role models anymore). Later on New Years they say that we are going to the Rose parade, as they found a way to get in easily. However, we would have to go early. and I thought that after staying up late New Years eve I wouldn't have enough energy to enjoy the parade. Long story short, they forced my to go, and I ended up napping the entire time. After winter break I started independent study, and they are now worried that I will stop seeing friends, and  instead stay inside all day. Independent study has allowed me to complete other work that I would normally do all weekend, feeling guilty if I didn't dedicate every moment of my free time to this work (I am a bit of a workaholic). This weekend, now that I didn't fill an extreme amount of guilt for hanging out, I decided to take a long break, watching Netflix and playing video games with friends all weekend. Meanwhile I put off chores until Monday, last night my parents shut off my internet, telling me they wouldn't turn it on until I got my chores done. I did my chores, and, rudely, told them to turn the internet back on. They told me that I was being disrespectful and entitled, I told them to stop parenting me, and that if I could get a job and leave I would. (Though I do have experience to get a job in programming, I am also 14... so I cant get a job).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for getting mad when my parents try to... parent me? ",

I was a major character and had NO understudy so if I didn’t show up the show could not go on and I wouldn’t be able to graduate with the rest of my class. \n\nAt the beginning of the semester our teacher gave us the 3 days the play was  going to be on so that we could make sure that we had ample time to plan our schedules around it (May 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) My mom tells me she’s thinking about having her wedding (her 3rd marriage) during either the first or second week of May and I told her that if it was on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd that I wouldn’t be able to be there for it because of the play.\n\nFast forward and it’s May and we’ve already done our first 2 performances. A month earlier my mom told me that she and her husband were having the wedding on the 3rd at 2pm. I said alright and left at that thinking that she remembered that my final was that day. I should have followed up with her to make sure she remembered and that was my mistake.\n\nSo it’s the 3rd and we’re all at the theatre rehearsing our lines and putting on make-up etc. But then I get the phone call.My mom wants to know when I am going to be there for the wedding to help set up.

So, maybe a week after T went back to school, I was working a shift with K and another friend (we can call him Q) the first half of the shift was fine, people pouring in and we barely had time to talk. Things took a turn when we all went on break together. I was craving a burrito and there was a Starbucks near by where I was going, so I offered K a ride since she was going there. We get back and Q is sitting there in the break room. \n\nWe sit down and Q looks at me and asks if I want to see this YouTube video of \"The Ultimate Vape\". I'm bored and have nothing better to do so I agree. We get to the point where its time to choose the flavor for the vape, and its churro flavor. This is what sets off the argument, because the man in the video didn't roll the R in churro (this is important to K because her and T are both half Black half Mexican women).  this is the conversation that followed.\n\nQ: Some people just can't roll their R's.\n\nK: That's why i hate White people,\n\nQ: ... that's kind of racist...\n\nThat's all i can fully remember was said but the events that followed were K saying you can't be racist towards White people and that's what THEIR argument was about.

So I sit aside let them have at it because if I choose a side I'm definitely loosing one of them as a friend.\n\nAt some point K turns to me, and she says,\n\nK: hey LexeL... I forgot my phone in my car, can you use yours to look up the definition of Racism?\n\nMe: I'm sorry K but this is between you two and id rather not get in the middle.\n\nAnd then she goes back to Q. i should mention that arguing over the Dictionary definition of racism had gone on for 3 minutes prior to this conversation. and Q had correctly said, Word for Word, what the definition of Racism was but K would not accept it.\n\nWe can skip to the end of break. I'm getting ready to go downstairs and K stops me.\n\nK: Have you talked to T lately?\n\nMe: Well I messaged her on Friday, but I know shes busy so I don't expect to talk to her until we Skype tomorrow. Why?\n\nK: Oh... well i just would expect to hear from her at all.\n\nThis interaction led me to believe that K had talked to T way before her argument with Q, and that she knew something I didn't, I spent the rest of my shift, nerves on end hoping I'd get to the bottom of this. \n\nK got off work before I did, terrible start to the rest of my night TBH. So as soon as I get off work this is the following conversation that I know by heart.\n\nText messages -\n\nT: what are you playing at??\n\nMe: Listen, idk what you've heard, who you've talked to, or what you're thinking, but I think we should talk.\n\nT: I agree.\n\nMe: Are you able to Skype tonight?\n\nT: We should just call on the phone...\n\nMe: okay.\n\nI have quite the drive home and I call her as soon as its over, we have a long talk about the situation that happened and she says that my story lines up with K's story. But... sadly I was in the wrong. Because I took no side in the situation, I actually took Q's side. \"a bystander is just taking the oppressors side without vocalizing it\" T said that she didn't think we should continue talking. We said goodbye for the last time and I never really got over it. so Am i the Asshole for not choosing her sisters side when her sister was wrong?\n\nTLDR; The sister of the girl I was seeing and another friend got into an argument about the definition of racism during break and i didn't choose a side, thus making me the bad guy in the eyes of the girl i was seeing.\n\nI wanna thank anyone for reading, even the TLDR, and I appreciate any comments. I'm just looking to learn from a past experience.\n\nThanks again!",

I had always thought he was cute, and though I hadn't ever actively considered sleeping with him I believed him when he said I was in to it and wanted it, even though I must have been super drunk because I've never blacked the point where I don't remember an ENTIRE block of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm on birth control, but it failed and shortly after we had sex I had a positive pregnancy test. I then went to my OB/GYN and found out that I'd essentially had been pregnant and suffered a very early miscarriage. He'd be the father, as I hadn't had sex with anyone but him. I had to have my birth control device (IUD) changed out and several ultrasounds bc any IUD associated pregnancy is extremely risky. I later had very heavy vaginal bleeding as a result of the hormone changes, having the IUD changed out, etc and ended up in the ER. All of this resulted in about $1500 worth of medical bills. I brought this up to him and he wasn't keen on helping out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, AITA for even expecting him to contribute a small financial amount?

She is a clean freak except doesn’t clean her stuff up to the same standard she holds others to. Stuff like leaving banana peels, dirty dishes, and other trash on the counter, but getting mad about the trash not being taken out or the floors not being swept. As a result, we’ve made a chore chart of sorts to determine who does what when. \n\nImportantly for this, I am almost never at the apartment except to sleep and shower, as I work 30 hours a week along with going to class. I pretty much never use dishes, and when I do I clean them up immediately. In the conversation with the chore chart, it was pointed out that this means I don’t have to do as much stuff in the kitchen, which was reflected in our chart. In this conversation it was also acknowledged that nobody had any problems with me.\n\nTonight, one of my roomies, B, sent a text in our groupchat (it’s hard for all of us to talk in person because of schedules) about laudry.

She then continued by saying that she doesn’t get what the big deal is and that she doesn’t feel comfortable in her own\n\n I’m upset because I wasn’t under the impression I had said anything wrong, but H’s response has me feeling like I have.

Despite this I have tried for years to make a relationship work between us to no avail. About 3 years ago it was feeling incredibly one sided so I just stopped contacting him to see if he actually had any interest in speaking with me of his own volition and in maintaining the relationship. Communication dried up for those years.\n\nMy sister doesn't know about the sexual abuse and as her older brother I took the physical abuse for her because I saw it as my duty to protect her, but she lived through the mental abuse maybe even worse than I had it. For a while this rightfully (in my mind) turned her against him. But then her husband threw her out in the streets on another continent and my father was the one she called and the one who came and got her through it. Good on him doing the right thing.\n\nWhere this gets more complicated is now in her eyes my dad can do no wrong. I was having a conversation with her about how much I wished I could have a normal relationship with him and her new view of him on the pedestal colored her words highly, but I didn't realize that at the time. After a long conversation between us I had the ridiculous idea that maybe it was all a misunderstanding and we just needed to communicate through it. That did not go well as I'm sure you can imagine.\n\n2 years ago I broke no contact with him and sent him a text. He is a multimillionaire and I live in poverty and have no insurance. I got test results that pointed to a high likelihood of cancer. I had no way to pay for any treatments I might have needed, was scared, and needed a father. I asked if he could loan me some money to help pay medical bills. He refused to help me at all if I did not move back into his house with him and claimed I was entitled for rejecting his \"help\" and asking for a loan, in many colorful words.\n\n(With no money to pursue further treatment or testing I still have no idea if I have cancer so maybe I'm dying? I don't even know. I've lost over 100 lbs in that time, albeit coming from obesity, but still it doesn't exactly seem like a good sign that I'm now underweight without trying to be.)\n\nWhen I spoke to him again after talking with my sister, I tried to explain how that previous conversation impacted me and that I wanted to find some common ground and try to move past this. At this point he throws my mental illness in my face and says I am not capable of knowing what I need and he knows better than me (despite knowing absolutely nothing about my life). This is where I snapped.\n\nMy entire life he promised to pay for my college education and he didn't even though he could have easily. No big deal under normal circumstance, whatever, it's his money. But I was pissed. I threw it in his face, hard. I chewed him out for every major and minor slight I could think of. I said I wish I didn't love him. I told him he was an awful parent and maybe if he had been successful in his suicide attempt when I was 4 I wouldn't be so fucked up with all the mental problems I have from his abuse.\n\nMy sister won't speak to me and I can't really blame her. She definitely sees me as the asshole. And even if she wasn't wrapped around my dad's finger, after saying something like that to him I don't know that there is ever a scenario where she wouldn't. But I'm sitting here thinking if she really knew the extent of the sexual abuse I suffered (or maybe even just knew it had happened at all) she might understand why I snapped and why the thought of just being around him gives me nightmares. But I want her to get a chance to have the kind of relationship I know I will never have with him and I don't want to ruin that chance for her by telling her.\n\nI know I shouldn't have said what I said. That's not even in question. It was a horrible thing to tell anyone.

These issues have been diagnosed by many psychiatrists and I’ve even been hospitalized for months on end because of them.  This may seem irrelevant to the story I’m about to tell you but bare with me it comes into play. BIG TIME. \n\nSo my father, we will call him Joe, he has a girlfriend whom we will call Mary. Joe and Mary have been together for around 8 months now and Mary even has a daughter who is fairly close to my age (her age being 20) and we share the same interests and mental health problems. We both have anxiety and clinical depression, her having anxiety more intense than mine and I also suffer from something called borderline personality disorder. (This causes you to have extreme mood swings and fear of abandonment issues) We shall call the daughter Mei. \n\nSo here’s where the actual story takes place. A few days ago on Saturday, Joe and I went to his girlfriends house to spend time. Me and Mei were telling Mary about how once we ordered Uber eats and both had anxiety attacks that the delivery guy was going to kill us and I had pulled a knife and hid behind the door. Joe chimes in even though he’s not included in the conversation and starts downplaying our mental illnesses. He starts saying things like \n\n“Oh, how can you guys have anxiety! Just done give a fuck about what’s going on!” \n \n“Oh come on really? BPD isn’t even that bad hahah you could’ve had cancer or something just shattttupppp” \n\nGee, thanks, my anxiety is now cured. Anyways he kept saying stuff like that and it was clearly angering everyone in the room. Me especially because he kept mentioning my disorder (BPD) even though he knows it causes me to cut myself and that’s what got me hospitalized. \nSo I accidentally slipped up and said\n\n “shut the fuck up” \n\nAt that point I knew I done goofed and instantly lowered my head. I apologized profusely and said I didn’t mean to say that and that I was out of line and he laughed it off and went upstairs. The next day when we were leaving he started screaming at me in the car. He told me he should’ve slapped me in my face and embarrassed me. I was super tired and the words went right through one ear and out the other.  \n\nFast forward to Monday. Me and my father joe didn’t speak all Monday with exception of him sending me texts saying what he told me in the car but now with a twist. \n\n“It’s February 11th and you have until the end of the week to get another job or else I’m selling everything you own, because I bought it. Welcome to reality.” \n\nThis caused me to have an anxiety attack at school and I went home early. I did apply to some places and thank goodness got a call back and I have an interview on Thursday. Anyways, on Tuesday I had to stay home because schools were cancelled due to an snow storm and he didn’t go to work for the same reason. He took this as his chance to burst into my room and scream at me. He called me every name in the book, he threatened to yank my piercings out my face, he even took it upon himself to yank the hood of my sweater basically choking me just so I would look at him. Mind you by that time he had already screamed at me to clean my room so I was folding clothes, that’s why I wasn’t looking at him.  I started screaming because I thought he was going to hit me in my face like he said he would and I had a major breakdown. Now my grandma says that if I try to leave and stay anywhere else he and the rest of my family will cut me off. \n\nAITA for telling him to shut the fuck up? \n\nEdit: guys how I put screenshots ?? I have text conversation with my aunt and mom, I don’t know if that’ll add any proof but I don’t know how to use reddit .. \n\nEdit 2: hey guys I had deleted the app shortly after posting this, I honestly just needed to vent. But all that aside, me and my father made up, we talked about it. I’m fine for those who are asking, no need to worry! ",

I adore my grandma so I’ll do anything to make her happy. When my grandmas at the bingo she’s a completely different woman, I’ve never seen her so happy, she walks (with her walking trolly for support) faster than I’ve ever seen, she smiles, gets all excited and it just makes my entire day.\n\nToday I took her as I always take her the first day after my payday so that I can play along side her (even though I have absolutely no clue what the hell I’m doing), everything was going as normal, I was losing money in confusion, my grandma was somehow winning constantly as always and we were having fun, about half way through the day another lady sat behind us, I see this lady quite a lot and she’s there every time I’m there, her friend came with her and they sat right behind us and spent the whole time chatting super loudly. \n\nNow I’m not sure if any of you have ever gone to bingo but being able to hear the speaker is vital in order to play, and the usual expectation is that everyone should keep quiet or should speak quietly. But because of them chatting about how the bus driver wasn’t white, and what groceries they bought that morning my grandma was struggling to hear the speaker and I could see she was starting to not enjoy our day. \n\nI decided to not say anything as I know this lady was just catching up with a friend, but after 2 hours of constant talking (they weren’t playing at all) I decided to turn around and I politely said “would you be able to keep your voice down my grandma can’t hear the speaker and she’s trying to play” the lady looked at me, didn’t respond and went back to her conversation, I decided to let it slide as I didn’t fancy arguing with someone 3 times my age, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she didn’t understand me, about an hour later my grandma got irritated and went “ Yap Yap Yap that’s what they sound like”, my grandma says things like that sometimes without realising, it’s just how she is now because of her dementia and she can’t help it, evidently the lady heard us because she turned and started having a go at my grandma who didn’t understand what was going on so I said “ if you kept quiet then my grandma wouldn’t mock you, so I suggest you shut up, keep quiet, play what you came here for and leave her alone” to be fair to her the lady did as I said and they kept their voices down. \n\nAfter we left I felt awful, I just feel guilty for being rude but I did what I had to to make sure my grandma was okay, AITA?

This was someone I could envision myself spending the rest of my life with. However, the last year or so I’ve been growing more and more discontent. I’ve noticed a decline in his personal hygiene and the amount of effort he puts into our relationship.\n\nI feel completely unappreciated. I do most of the cleaning, purchase most of our food, give him as many rides as I can, and initiate sex more often than not. Lately he’ll just fall asleep on me if I try to get us to do anything of that nature.\n\nI’ve brought these issues up multiple times. I’ve tried to be as compassionate as possible. I KNOW that some are the issues are because he is depressed. We’ve talked about it at length. I also suffer from depression and anxiety, but I have been to therapy and he has not. I have given him links to several different programs for “affordable” mental healthcare, but I know he hasn’t followed up with any of it. \n\nAny time I try to talk about ANY of our issues, he either gets irrationally angry with me or completely shuts down and refuses to talk at all. He’ll tell me what I want to hear or go into self destruction mode, saying that he’s the shittiest person in the world (which I do not agree with, obviously).\n\nI just feel at this point that I CAN’T talk to him about how I’m feeling at all. I don’t want to keep harping on the same issues. I don’t want to pressure him into having sex with me. I don’t want him to tell me what I want to hear. This is why I had the thought of just writing a letter or something, completely detailing everything that I’ve been having issues with. I’m just afraid of that blowing up in my face as well.\n\nI’m not sure exactly what my next move should be. I want to work through these issues, not just immediately give up on our relationship. This is the only thing I can think of that would allow me to get all of my thoughts out in a cohesive manner, but I’m afraid of him taking it the wrong way.\n\nSo, Reddit, would writing this letter make me the asshole?

That's been a little frustrating but understandable. My real annoyance comes from that over the past couple weeks she's made 4 dates with me, and then bailed pretty close to the date each time. Excuses were pretty much always work related, and I definitely understand having to pick up a last minute shift, or having a really trying day and being too tired to go out. On the other hand I can't help but be unhappy with the situation. \n\nThat brings us to the current situation, I asked her last weekend when she would be free next because I'd like to see her. She responded that she was going to be getting off early on Wednesday and we should go out after. I agreed and planned on seeing her Wednesday night. Wednesday morning she texts me to ask if we're still going out, I confirm and we agree I'll pick her up from work. \n\nLater on in the day she texts me to say she still wants to go out, but she's gotta be home by 10:30. I was a little disappointed because she often doesn't get off until 9:00 or so, but it had been a couple weeks since I'd seen her so I agreed and told her to let me know when she would be off. She assured me again it would be early because Wednesdays are slow. \n\n9:00pm rolls around and I haven't heard from her, so I text to ask if she is still stuck at work. No response. \n\nToday, she finally texted me back over 24 hours later. The text just said \"I lost my phone 💀💀💀.\" I sort of doubt the truthfulness of that, but even if it were true I kinda feel like there's any number of ways she could have cancelled on me. Besides surely bailing on a fifth date in a row, this time with no contact, should warrant some kind of apology. \n\nAnyway I haven't texted her back, and I kind of don't plan to. I had discussed the situation with my best friend, and he told me not texting her back is a dick move. Am I the asshole if the way I prefer to handle it is just to kind of stop talking to her?",

Apparently, she never follows up on her threats to report me and seem to only be on a power trip. \n\nI tried politely disagreeing, ignoring her, calling her out, speaking to lthe union and speaking to management, but they were dismissive and said not to worry. I think the reason that nobody believes me is because she's exceptionally friendly to everyone, especially me, when in public, but it's all fake because she's constantly talking behind people's backs as well. She also bootlicks managers frequently to get in their good books. \n\nThe last thing that I am to do is to report her to the agency we work for, who will likely sack her immediately. They are aware of it but I opted to wait and see if she does it again, as it is frowned upon to bypass management and go straight to the agency.

A lot. A few years ago when we used our PS3 a lot, he broke about 4 controllers in separate fits of rage, and during his fortnite addiction, I heard some loud banging from across the hallway. The next day, he started asking for my controller.\n\nThis controller is simply a wired Xbox controller made for people who want to play PC games using a controller but don't want to spend the 60 bucks on a wireless controller that I got for my birthday. I use this controller a lot for the sort of couch co-op or games that have very simple controls (Think GBA emulation, The Binding of Isaac, Super Treasure Arena, etc.).\n\nSo I say okay at first, but tell Zam he needs to save money up for a controller of his own. He says he will, and I'm alright with this deal.\n\nThat was three months ago, and he has yet to get a new controller, and I've heard him abuse mine more than once.\n\nEventually, I wanted to play some Isaac with my computer connected to the TV so I could sit on my bed while playing, and asked if I could use the controller once he was done with his round of fortnite. He muttered sure and continued playing. The round ends, and he doesn't give it back. Instead, he just queues up again. I tell him to give it back, and he says \"I just started this round, let me finish R\\*tard\". I'm livid at this point, so I unplug the controller, turn off the xbox, take the controller, and walk out of the room. (This was probably an overreaction, but he used R\\*tard specifically against me because I have Asperger's Syndrome). He calls me an asshole for doing that and he attempts to grab me and shove me against a wall. I shove him away, he stumbles, then he runs down to mom, crying, and tells her that I beat him up (He's 12, and he wasn't crying when he got stabbed by a fucking fish hook from his own stupidity). I got grounded for a week on account of \"Treating my brother like crap\", and he taunted me by using my controller the entire time I was grounded.\n\nI had enough, and I've taken it; every time he asks for it I say no.\n\nHe still insists I'm an ass for doing so, and that's the question: Am I The Asshole?

There have been times they didn't even talk to her son, two to three years in total (petty reasons). My husband always stands up for me, so that's never been an issue between us.\n\nA couple of weeks ago they asked him how we handle the \"dog problem\" when we're going on vacation. He told them how it is: we always take him with us, usually hiking and car camping.\n\nA few days go by and my husband tells me his dad invited him on a trip to the US, he'll let him pick all the places he wants to go, he'll pay for everything.\nWe're from Europe and money is a little tight so it's a big thing. \n\nPart of me now wishes my husband had said no, since they had first asked about the both of us...and their \"solution\" is to invite him only instead of finding something suitable for our situation?\n\nNow for the stupid part:\nI wouldn't even have wanted them to pay for anything anyway, I would've probably declined any offer. We don't get along, I am simply not the woman they would've wanted for their son.\nThey weren't there when their son needed them, he had to take a student loan (which we're still paying off) because his dad didn't feel it was his obligation to support his son who's the first academic in his family. My in-laws aren't filthy rich but they're quite well-off. It's their money and they shall do with it whatever they please. \nOffering my husband a trip that'll cost them a couple of thousand Euros after they have just recently re-established the connection (after a year of silence, see above) just gives me a weird feeling, besides being kind of hurt because he accepted without hesitation.\n\nHis mom has been spoiling him ever since they're in touch again, too. She sent him several three-figure amounts of money for Christmas, his birthday etc. It's a little much and unusual. \nI'm all for loving parents but I'm afraid they might hold it against him some day.\nHis whole family is messed up because of money - e.g. his dad and uncles don't talk anymore because of their dad's heritage.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to be thrilled about the whole thing?\n\n\n\nTl; dr: My usually cheap in-laws invited my husband to an expensive trip to the U.S. and I'm having a hard time feeling happy for him.",

We live with roommates as it's a 6 bedroom house. We rent the rooms with all utilities included, access to the pool, laundry room, and both patio areas are open for them to have late night guests. We offer them cheaper for students, as that's who we mainly attract being close to the university. In doing so we share common areas. The kitchen being one of them. I cook, A LOT, and whenever I cook, I always tell the other three people living here that there is plenty of food for them to share, and most nights they will come and join us for dinner, or at least eat leftovers. This is done out of generosity because I see how hard a lot of them work, and two of who are here from out of state and away from family. This is where the problem started, and I thought should have ended. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, I took my wife and son out to a Japanese restaurant. My wife loves sushi, and that is our treat usually once a month. My son loves teriyaki so it's a win for everyone. After eating, my wife ordered two sushi roll to take home and eat with the movie we picked for that night. So we grab the to go sushi and head home. A few hours after arriving home, we start popping corn for the movie and my wife noticed her sushi is gone. We asked around, and sure enough the only make tenant we have ate them. Actually went into the bag, opened it up, and ate her two sushi rolls. About 16 pieces. I was flabbergasted. I asked him very angrily why he would do that, and he says, \"You always offer us lunch or dinner, so I thought leftovers would be the same way.\"\n\nThat to me screams entitlement, and I am not excited that my wife's food was just taken within just a few hours of even being purchased. He obviously saw that it was not leftovers either, but an entirely separate purchase. \n\nI discussed with him that it was not acceptable to go into our possessions, whether it be food or otherwise, and to use common sense before eating anything that is not his, as I have NEVER ordered takeout or from a restaurant for these tenants before.\n\nThis brought up a discussion with the other tenants, and we discovered that one had actually purchased a mini fridge because her food would turn up missing also. When confronted with this information, the food thief admitted to drinking her iced coffees, her cheesecake, etc. Overall, not fucking cool. We told him he had 30 days from the first of this month to be out, because he violated the tenant agreement by stealing others belongings. We have to look out for those renting our rooms, so the eviction was a mutual agreement. \n\nHe argues of course, but ultimately knows he can do nothing. Yet, he now knows he has nothing to worry about with stealing food. So yes, food has been disappearing ALL week from everyone.\n\nHere is where I need an opinion. I want to buy a nice steak and leave it in my car for a couple days, then prepare it with some veggies and potatoes and leave it on the refrigerator, obviously for the food thief to eat and get sick. Is this illegal? Is there any other suggestions for me to get my petty ass revenge on a food thief in my home?",

In the end, she had her reasons for not wanting to continue the relationship, which I respected, these included things such as culture, school stress, and just wanting to be her own person.\n\nWe made the effort to try and remain friends the same way we were before the relationship, which to this day is still happening, which I’m grateful for. She got over the relationship very quickly however,probably around a week or two after we broke up we were texting about feelings and stuff and she mentioned she basically had 0 romantic feelings for me anymore and that I shouldn’t try and get my hopes up of ever getting back with her (this is because I did have and still do have strong feelings for her, she wasn’t saying it to be an ass). \n\nThe problem is, shortly after the break up, she starts hanging around with this guy, who we will call A. She claims that A was a family friend from when she was younger, who didn’t speak to her much during our relationship out of respect. However, she calls him her best friend, but never mentioned him or anything to do with him once in the time we were friends or during the relationship, only after. \n\nDuring our relationship, it definitely seemed as if I would always be the one to initiate anything, intimacy, dates, all of it. She didn’t make to much of an effort to plan things or anything, and would often back out of things due to family stuff which I respected (she has had a rough upbringing so I respected these reasons). \n\nSince we broke up, she has been hanging with A a lot. Like nearly daily going out on drives, going out places to eat etc, none of which she really did with me. \n\nI asked her if they have feelings for each other since we agreed to be open with this sort of stuff shortly after breaking up and she insisted nothing was happening and that he was like a brother to her, but recently she’s admitted they now both have strong feelings for each other and she said she loves him and can’t see herself with anybody else. She’s barely talking to me anymore and is always talking to or is always with this guy, and is not making an effort with me whatsoever despite regarding me as one of her best friends.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for being suspicious that there might have been something going on between my ex and A while we were together?

When I decided to switch universities last year and move back in with my parents I was giving up a very well paying, stable job as an au pair/tutor. I hadn’t lived at home for about 4 years and in that time my mother and father made the decision to start fostering a 13 year old I will call Alice. I love Alice, I never had a girly kinda sister around since I had a very manly lesbian sister and my twin brother. She’s hard working, sweet and caring, and none of this is directed towards her. \nTo make up for me not having a stable income anymore my parents decided to hire me as an au pair to Alice. \nMy hours are essentially 07:00-07:30 Monday till Friday, 14:00-16:00 Monday till Thursday and 14:00-20:00 on a Friday (She has choir in a town 40 minutes away and we get home late every Friday). This in between studying full time, and working another side job. \nThey pay me R3400 a month (about $244) which is supposed to include my fuel. I drive about 22km (about 14 miles) every day dropping and fetching her from school. Au Pairs in my country generally charge R50-75 an hour ($3.50-7.50) and R3/km ($0.20). \n\nNow that all of that is over let me start from about 15 minutes ago when I told my parents that I wanted to stay at my boyfriends house this weekend, starting on Thursday as I currently have off from school and he is house sitting this entire weekend, so he has no way of visiting me. My mother freaked saying that who would look after Alice on Friday, as she is also on break and therefor doesn’t have school on Friday either. I stood there flabbergasted as my mom berated me about how if I was her client back in the old town I would not treat her like this and that I should look after Alice this Friday. I walked out of the room absolutely furious that she would speak to me like that. If she wanted me to look after Alice she could have asked nicely and I would have said yes and gone through to my boyfriend Friday afternoon instead. \n\nShe brought in business a o I decided to handle this as cleanly and business-like as possible. After some serious calculations I figured out that my parents were not only underpaying me (R35 an hour/$2.50) but also grossly misusing me. So I’ve decided to propose I charge them what they should be paying me, including overtime for looking after my sister this entire week. Since I only work from 14:00, that would include an extra 6 hours of work everyday that they need to pay me for, and I would discuss a new monthly rate that I should be rightfully paid. I am separating business from family and if they want to look for a cheaper option they can try but they will not find it, as I would be charging them the bottom rate for an au pair here. \n\nSo my question is, AITA for doing this to my parents? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

TL;DR at the end\n\nFirst, my son, who is 16, got a part time job over this last summer. He raised enough so he can get the family gifts for Christmas and a ps4 for himself. I couldn't buy him one since all my money goes to my parents for personal and financial reasons. We both live with my parents and it's not out of being super poor, but it's comfortable and my parents are very chill.\n\nI work basically a 9 to 5 job, but backwards. 9 to 5... Night shift.

My parents spoil my son a bit too much to not care about his grades. They usually throw the \"you should focus more\" line to my son which just goes right by him.\n\nOne day, before work, I see what my son is up to and... It's his PS4. He is on it. I haven't noticed much of him playing it until I saw his report card right after mid terms and Christmas break happened. When I saw him I told him that he needs to study more and that the ps4 is making him do less work in school. He tells me not to worry. Me, being stressed a bit before work, snap a little. His grades haven't been doing too well and that I wanted to see his grades on the spot (they have the grades online and I trust him to show me when I ask). But, he hesitated a bit. He said he may have low grades because he still needs to turn some stuff in.\n\nI'm a bit angry at this point. I know I shouldn't have but it didn't change the fact he had low grades. He finally showed me and there was an F! A big ol F in Chemistry. It's a hard class I know but, an F! A lot went through my head. Why haven't I been notified by the teacher he's doing this bad?? How come he hasn't asked for help? I always tell him to ask me for anything. Then I asked myself. Is it because he's playing games all the time???\n\nI told him that he needed to give me that PS4 on e spot. We argued a bit. He paid for the ps4 but I paid for his school. I had to head off to work and didn't finish the argument, but the next day while he was at school I took the ps4.\n\nHe was angry at me for the first time in his life. Saying that he worked hard for that ps4. I told him about his grades and he said he needed to turn stuff in still. I told him he shouldn't be late in the first place. \n\nThis was only about a week ago. And he still has an F in Chemistry\n\nI told my parents I did this and they said I needed to go easier on him but I disagree.\n\nI told my son I'd give it back once he gets his grades up. But he DID pay for this ps4. It's his. And I took it.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR my son had a summer job, paid for his own PS4, but I took it away recently because his grades haven't been doing well at all (Failing a class).",

I didn't show up for an organisation seminar because of my medical condition and she made a whole fuss about it because \" we are one apartment and should represent the same things,and if you don't like the organisation,why aren't you leaving??\" I told her I like the education part but she kept asking me this until we had a fight where I told her its none of her business why im here and i was here before her.\nIt went like this for the whole year,other roomates decided to stop talking with her altogether because she was constantly trying to boss them around,we couldn't tell non PC jokes to each other without her triggering and fighting with us,she tried to force people and tell them their mental problems because \"it will bring us closer\" and was just an overall bitch to everyone who disagreed with her.I once told my friend a joke with the word \" butch\" in it and Z heard it-so she went around telling my friends that I'm a misogynist..it cost me in a loss of some friends.\na whole year of being policed at your house wasn't fun,she was always looking for a way for her to \"educate\"us which came across as very condescending - I don't need her lectures about how horrible I am for eating meat and not caring about the organisation. She never helped us clean and always left dirty dishes around the house- when we brought them to her room and left it there she cried and told us she will complain to V (V knew she was problematic but couldn't kick her out)\n\nSo,the big fight :\nWe were supposed to clean the apartment,I came home early and it was only her there. I wanted to rest because I has a rough day,I asked her id she wanted to help me clean some stuff &amp; wash the floor  and she agreed.\nWhen I put some stuff in the other room,she decided that \"because I put them in an angry way, I'm mad at her so she won't help me\"\nAfter a whole year of hearing this kind of bs from her I've had enough,I yelled at her that she tries to be a victim and she went to her room.\nI started to wash the floor by myself and she came back and just sat in the living room full of water not even trying to help.\nI asked her \" why are you such a bitch?\" \nShe started screaming - calling me disgusting but I yelled back \" no shut the fuck up alredy,this is why no one in your last apartment liked you,and everyone here hates you and I can't wait until you leave and I won't have to see your ugly face again you fucking bitch!\" \nand I stormed off leaving the floor wet.\nI did end up apologizing because I was harsh on her,it was just frustrating to always be criticised in your  house and not being able to make it stop despite asking.\n\nSo Reddit..AITA for what I said to her\n\n",

Along comes this first-time fic writer with some pretty awful grammar and spelling, whose comments read like a kindergarten kid just learning to make long sentences. Except her content isn't kindergarten-grade, because she writes mostly *explicit* romance fic.\n\nHer works are essentially erotic vignettes straight out of your typical porno flick except with the characters' names tacked on and basically makes for a painful read because they just don't match up to who the characters are actually like in the source material. It even reads like a self insert in the guise of a gender swapped character at times - and considering the characters this genderswapped version is normally paired with are characters she's expressed personal interest in before it's not hard to make the connection.\n\nShe's asked three of my fellow writer friends to help her edit her work since, which has greatly improved the grammar and spelling of her content to be actually readable, but a lot of her \"characterisation\" (or lack thereof) remains in the final work and her fic summaries which she writes herself are her usual typo-riddled style. I tried reading a few chapters of her work just to see how much my friends were able to turn things around, which is truthfully not much.\n\nShe still doesn't know I blocked her and occasionally addresses me in convos even though I never reply. One time she was talking about her newest chapter which she posted earlier when I happened to be online and her beta for that chapter (also a dear friend of mine and a longtime writing partner) remarked good work. The following exchange was paraphrased:\n\nAuthor: You're the only one who's seen it though, the others haven't, how is it good work?\n\nBeta: It's good work because even if they haven't seen it it's posted and finished, something finished and posted no matter the quality is already good work\n\nMe: It's effort for sure, regardless of the result one already put effort into it that counts for something... I guess\n\nNobody remarked on my comment, but the beta DMed me asking me if it was a call-out for someone. I told them it was nothing at the time, but now I wonder whether I was too snobbish and dismissive of someone who regardless of their skill still put time into doing something they love. On top of that I never confronted her with my gripes about her writing and just pretended nothing was different while basically ignoring her. As a writer myself I know how precious support from peers is, even if as a reader I'm very selective. So am I being elitist or just have preferences?",

            "input": "Well, where to start? I haven't talked with my mother regularly in two years and I think it took me a lot to get to that point. I guess I'll split this up by major events?\n\n2 years ago, pre-wedding:\n\nThere was a large family event, small-family (less than 20 with cousins and aunts) but the event was big enough to get most of them together, my mother was not explicitly invited.\n\nMy mother was not invited because the person getting married and she had not on spoken in years. It was decided that she would be allowed to act as a plus-one to any member that wanted to take her and basically everyone offered. My mom took to this as being a huge sign of disrespect, not getting an explicit invitation, and chose not to come. Eventually asking me not to participate either. I chose to go because I hadn't seen some of these cousins in years.\n\nThe out-of-town family was staying the weekend so I asked if we wanted to go to a theme park. Everyone ended up thinking it was a great idea. I invited my mom but then my aunt decided to go and my mom blew up. Also choosing not to go to that either. She had made it about herself, as if the theme park visit was about family getting to see her. At this point, I guess she decided she was having an argument with her sister.\n\nSo, I was casually asked to not go. I think a week or two before my mom tried to make plans for the weekend of the wedding to which I think I initially agreed. I think it was spring break maybe summer, I'm at uni hence the title. Once I realized the dates I made it clear I couldn't hang out with her. I think this is when I thought of going to the park and invited her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 years ago, post-wedding:\n\nMost of the family hung out excluding my mother. She chose not to come. I even pleaded for her to participate and it was a constant will she won't she. By the end of it, right as I was driving home, I think she sent a several \"page\" text (it's not really pages on iPhone anymore but you get the point?) maybe saying sorry but it quickly broke down into an argument. When arguing with her it's just so stressful trying to get all these things across and never getting a chance so I got to the point of finally saying alright express all you grievances so I can get my turn. It ended with her saying this aunt raped her with a water hose before I was born. She had never mentioned this and I don't really understand how this was relevant to the situation. It felt manipulative and I couldn't really process anything at all anymore so I told her she needed to leave me alone. \n\nI blocked her from my phone and that's really the only way to get a hold of me. She has my main email address and I never let it get out of control but shes never emailed. I could no longer handle the instability and unpredictability of her meltdowns. I think I had recently told her that and then like a day later a meltdown happened. It was like she was pretending not to hear me and would specifically do what I told her stressed me out.\n\nFast forward 1 year ago:\n\nThere was another wedding and literally, everyone was invited. I hadn't talked to my mother since the last one. I didn't sit with her at the ceremony or the after thing (the dance/ eating/ party thing after the church. I get confused on the terms, sorry.). I got pretty drunk and I think I started talking to her about my 17 years younger half-brother. He's basically illiterate and now aged in the double digits. I think she left shortly after? I know another aunt came over and tried to reconcile differences at some point. Deciding she would mediate but I think she had chosen to fight for my mom so not true meditation.  I know I got way drunk I can't remember much? I don't think I talked to my mom during this time through text.\n\nWithin a week:\n\nI've been doing great! I was constantly a nervous wreck most of my life. I always had terrible acne but I've been getting good sleep and eating well. My face is clear, I make great grades, and I'm making friends.\n\nI play Fortnite with my little brother and he has expressed that he planned on going to graduation. I texted my mother at the start of this semester, my senior year, to start coordinating plans for graduation. Earlier last week I texted her and asked if it would be okay to call, she agreed. The phone call went well. She was acting very nervous at first but I can't really guess why. She was like almost expecting a certain thing but sounded generally happy. I think she thought I was calling because I was like dying or something? I ended up having to hang up because of a quick emergency. So, I texted her back 5 minutes later and said it was good talking to you and said sorry for just springing up out of nowhere to talk. She responded with a massive text talking about how much I hurt her and that she'll remember these things \"until the day I die\" saying she left the most recent wedding early because of me. I accepted fault and said I was pretty drunk. Then it was just text after text of her resaying all the same stuff and not really listening to what I had to say. Similar to the last time we texted and maybe as it has always been?\n\nI recently read a book, the laws of human nature, and I have been considering peoples backgrounds when how they act. I have learned to understand my mother's behavior and I was trying to forgive her. I don't want to act the way she acts. This book explains it is very likely I will fall into the same habits if I don't stay conscious about it. I don't know why I reached out, I guess it's my mom. I want to be able to have a stable relationship.  \n\nAnyway, I asked my mom if it would be okay if I visit over the current winter break. She started sending all the texts about how disrespectful I was and that there need to be rules I have to accept if I'm to see my little brother. Honestly, it has been two years and she had acted cool in the texts earlier this semester about coming to graduation. Well, I didn't like the tone of the conversation so I said we would go back to not talking. She started being whishy-washy and tried to make it sound like it was her idea to not talk? Idk it sounds petty but I think it is relevant to say it was my choice.\n\nPrevious 24 hours:\n\nShe is obviously pissed and was talking about years of grief. When I expressed one thing specifically that she constantly makes me feel bad about she acted as if she was never mad about that and made it seem like it was actually me who was mad over this event 14 years in the past. She graduated from college and moved me into my dads while she lived with the aunt I mentioned earlier. I decided to stay with my dad once she got an apartment and shes always told me how it hurt her and never accepts an apology for it. I mentioned this grievance and she made it seem like she was never mad about me staying with my dad and that she thought I was the one mad this whole time. Like what do I even have to be mad about that I stayed living with my dad?\n\nI decided to uninvite her to my graduation. It is way too much stress. She hasn't helped me with the price of a cheeseburger since I started. She never really makes me feel good about myself. I just don't want to talk to her at all anymore. I've started a new book about surviving psychological abuse and she is a textbook abuser. \\*cue I can see clearly now\\*. \n\nI texted her and I think I'll just copy paste? me: Well, I put a lot of thought into it. I don’t want you at my graduation. I’m no longer interested in maintaining a relationship. You had a lot of terrible things to say and if I ever try to explain how you make me feel you minimize or ignore it maybe you say I have the wrong memory all-together. Anyway, I don’t wanna deal with it anymore. I was really trying to be nice when I reached out, you’re very angry. I think you project a lot so I feel like I sound like you when I’m trying to explain what you do but that’s for you to figure out! Bye I guess \n\nHer: You know what Erick, I’m done with you son. You’ve been so disrespectful and shitty towards me since you were about 11. You’ve got issues, and you need to grow up! I’m a good mom and was a “great” mom to you. You totally don’t deserve me. Thank God I have \\[little bro\\] because if all I had as a reference as a mom and you were my only child I’d probably have shot myself. Don’t contact me again.\n\nSo, grand-finale, my mother just told me she would have killed herself if I was her only son and that I've been terrible since I was 11? Who gets mad at an 11-year-old. She has a social work degree, I would think they tell you it is never the child's fault?\n\nI think I'm better off. I think she's being manipulative and knows full well what she does.\n\nTL;DR  First, I think you need to read it all, I know I needed to write it! Haven't talked to my mom in 2 years. She hasn't talked with most of her family in as long or much much longer. I told her she is not invited to my college graduation and that I don't want to talk to her anymore. She said she would have killed herself if I was her only son and to not contact her anymore.\n\nJust here for the judgment. AMIA?",

Truth is, he's struggling, at least from what he's told me. \n\nHe isn't even bad looking, but he's not happy that he keeps getting treated like...a bit of a bitch I guess, from his his own words. He's not respected, and is viewed as friend zone (not even friend zone, more like 'bitch zone', lol). \n\nHe's too nice, effeminate and has no backbone. When he wants to 'get with' a girl, he starts talking to her as he would a friend but comes across as too nice. He'd be a great friend, for sure, but that's now what *he* wants. He wants to be hooking up with girls like his friends are doing at parties.\n\nHe came to me for help, and pleaded me to help. Now I am 5 years his senior, but I've slept with quite a lot of girls while at uni, again, uni is different, but it's pretty clear that my brother looks up to me for this. I gave him some core advice:\n\n- Stop being nice. From now on, you are not a nice guy. I don't care if you have to do a 180 and act like a douchebag, even that is better than being a nice boy. No more nice guy means no more mr effeminate bitch boy. He has to be more masculine (masculinity = good).\n\n- No more talking to girls like friends. You are being dishonest when wanting to befriend girls. You don't even want female friends (and you don't need them, you have male friends). From now on, if a girl tries talking to you, be disinterested and be aloof\n\n- When this works, many girls WILL be attracted to you. Don't get into a relationship, you can do that shit in your 30s. If you want sex, have sex, and then don't text them after\n\n- Main advice: **Don't listen to girls advice, INCLUDING my older sister's advice (26F), we will call her Georgia. Georgia has given him advice on girls and said ''You need to be nice, respectful and considerate, that's all you need''. Obviously this advice has proven useless. I told my younger bro that basically...girls just want a guy who ''gets it'', obviously asking a woman for advice she will give you the wrong advice (unknowingly) because they want the guy to ''just get it''**\n\nNow my bro has implemented my advice and he has slept with 1 girl so far and gotten a blow job from another. Some of the people at school were initially resistant to his new personality, but I said he had to force it. And now after a short while...he got laid, they are now ''re adjusting'' to the new him, and not the bitch boy.\n\nNow the main conflict here is that my sister Georgia knows what I told him and shouted at me saying I am ''filling his mind with crap'' and that I'm a douchebag, but then I said to my sister back ''You don't even care about the kid...he came to you for advice and you gave him half assed crap''. She then told me to fuck off. I don't know why she reacted so strongly, lol, she gave him shit advice. AITA?",

I think this is because she didn’t like my mother. My grandfather died when I was around 8 and he was a lovely man but he didn’t prevent her behaving the way she did. \n\nMy parents separated when I was 11 and she didn’t bother to stay in contact with me, my brother who was 16 and my sister who was 18. I don’t believe she should take any blame for this lack of contact as we were the kids in the situation and she was the adult. \n\nMy dad basically disappeared from our lives for about 5 years or so as well and I later found she was abusive to him when he was growing up although I’m not sure what form that abuse took. \n\nMy brother’s eldest son was her great grandchild. He is now 15 and she has never met him. My brother has since had another child and my sister has two kids who again she has never met. I am now pregnant with my first child and I know she would not have them this baby either. However she has met and had a relationship with my cousins kids. \n\nI saw her for the first time in years at my Dad’s 60th which I helped to organise, but I didn’t know she would be there. My  Dad’s girlfriend must have invited her. She didn’t acknowledge me or my brother. My sister did not attend as she doesn’t want a relationship with my father. \n\nI have somewhat repaired my relationship with my Dad but I keep it up for his sake mostly. I don’t really get anything out of it. I just feel guilty if I don’t have some sort of relationship with him. \n\nI’m really uncomfortable with the thought of going to the funeral. I barely speak to my cousins and I know they will be fully involved in the funeral. I’m worried they will judge us for coming and blame us for not having a relationship with her. I also don’t want to listen to a eulogy about how great she is when she treated me, my siblings, our kids and my Dad terribly. I also had to take time off sick from work lately due to pregnancy related issues and they were so understanding. I’m entitled to bereavement leave but I hate asking for more time off. I also don’t want people at work hearing my grandmother died and being all pitying and I’ll just come across heartless because I’m upset about it. I mean I feel really weird and anxious about it but I’m not sad that she died. \n\nDoes that make me a terrible person? My brother thinks we should go to be there for my Dad, that it’s the right thing to do.  And to be honest if my brother has to go back home to face all the small town gossipers, I don’t want him to face it alone and I feel like we should be able to walk in there with our heads held high as we did nothing wrong. I just don’t feel like honoring this woman. \n\nTL:DR: Didn’t have relationship with grandmother. Not a nice woman. AITA for not wanting to go to her funeral? ",

Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",

A few months back she got a job at a department store and met a guy who would text her nonstop at all hours. I never gave it much thought until she got angry and defensive after I asked for her phone password while she was driving to change the song on Spotify. I asked her if it had anything to do with this guy from work, and got the \"you shouldn't worry about him\" talk in return. \n\n\n\n\nFast forward to this past weekend, I drove us down to San Diego just to hang out, which is give or take 2 hours away from our area. Everything had been going great all day, and we were waiting to order in a Denny's when she got all serious and dropped the absolute shocker of a lifetime. That guy wasn't just a friend, but she was *going to* cut him off after feeling super duper guilty, poor her. Iwas obviously still hurt, but mostly I was just pissed, so I stormed off, got in my car, and left her there.\n\n\n\n\nI pulled over a few miles away and she was blowing up my phone, apologizing, cussing me out, etc. In the middle of it all she did manage to tell me I had to come back and get her. I started to feel really guilty. She had her phone and wallet and all, but at this point with traffic, it would be around 3 hours before anyone would make it out to her. I didn't even know if her mom or sister were at work or not and able to go get her.  I gave thought to turning back, but eventually angrily texted her back to make her co-worker come get her.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways I still feel pretty shitty about the whole thing, in the moment I just couldn't fathom being in a car with her for hours listening to excuses. I've asked a few friends about this and have gotten really mixed responses about if I was in the wrong here.

When I met her she was financially stable, though I make mid-six figures and she makes mid-five figures. I appreciated that she was frugal (as am I) and didn't waste money on things like trips or expensive meals out or material items no one needs. After a while she admitted to me that the reason she is so frugal is because she grew up very poor and does not have a safety net. Last spring she had an accident that resulted in her being in the hospital for some time and saddled her with a great deal of medical bills. From day one she was adamant that because we had only been dating for a few months, I was not responsible for any of her bills, nor did she even want me to know the financial specifics of them. I was fine with that and we continued as usual. I did notice that she has become more frugal than before and has acted as if she is under more stress, but I honestly thought it had more to do with the accident than anything else.\n\nLast weekend we met up with two of our other friends for brunch. My GF said she wasn't hungry and didn't order anything during the meal and just had a cappuccino and some of my home fries, but we all split the meal four ways anyway because that's how it is with these friends. It wasn't a huge bill but she was obviously annoyed about having to put her card down for it, even though we've all paid our share of meals where we had the smallest item before. Anyway, when we were on our way home we passed a woman selling tamales on the corner for $2 apiece. GF says to me \"Babe, do you have $2?\" I did have cash, but she had literally just sat through a meal saying she wasn't hungry, and I was embarrassed by the way she had rolled her eyes while settling the bill, so I told her there was a bank across the street. She went \"I don't want to have to take out a $20 just for a two dollar tamale,\" and I told her \"Fine, don't get a tamale then.\" She got really quiet and went \"I'm just really hungry,\" and I kind of snapped at her and told her that she should have ordered something at brunch instead of just eating my leftovers. Then she told me that she has been \"food insecure\" over the past few weeks because of her medical/credit card debt and that she didn't have the $20 in her bank account to take out because she had to pay at brunch. She said she hadn't told me about any of this because she \"knew\" I would judge her for not handling her money more wisely, started crying, called me an asshole, and walked off. I haven't spoken to her since it happened on Sunday.\n\nI don't think this is fair for a number of reasons, the biggest being that I'm not a mind reader and wouldn't know anything about her finances because she expressly told me her medical bills were none of my business. I highly doubt the \"food insecure\" claim, but either way, she has been way too eager to let me pick up the bill when we go out to eat over the past couple months (even though at the beginning of the relationship we always split it evenly, or she'd pay if she ordered the more expensive thing). She makes a salary and I have no reason to believe she can't afford food to eat, so I'm pretty sure this is a guilt trip situation. But like I said, she hasn't spoken to me since Sunday and it's Thursday morning, so I am looking for an objective opinion: am I the asshole for not giving her tamale money, or does she need to realize that she can't keep mooching off people just because she's in debt?",

We dated for 2 years and his drinking became too much for me to handle so i moved out in May. We stayed friends.

It's very catholic in my area, lots of prolifers who think women should be punished for having control over their reproductive organs.

Before I worked here, there was another supervisor that worked in my place. A few years ago she lost her mother. She had to go back to Hungary for the funeral. A bunch of clients and residents had donated money but a few co-workers had also lent her some money too (about $1000). They gave it to her with the understanding that she would pay it back. Well months passed and she ended up leaving for a better job opportunity. Since then she's been avoiding calls from the people I work with and has only given them a fraction of what was loaned to her.\n\nNow come to the present time. A co-worker approached me yesterday and told me that his 92 year old grandmother has passed away. He explained that he would like to attend the funeral and be with family in his homeland, India. He was very sad about this. I had consoled to the extent of professionalism but that was all. I do feel bad for anyone who has lost a loved one, but she was 92. I can only feel sadness for someone briefly if they lived a long healthy life. I think if anything, that calls for a celebration.\n\nAnyways, so this guy is telling about the prices to go to India and how outrageous it is. I totally understand the stress of it all but then he asks me for a loan. He wanted about $500 to help him out. I immediately say no. I wasn't rude about it but I made it clear that I don't do that. I don't mind lending money to family and friends who I trust. A co-worker is a completely different story though. I just don't trust him. He may try to pull what the other supervisor did. All of it just seemed fishy. I wasn't interested in getting wrapped up in financial drama. Not to mention, it's two days after Christmas which is always a difficult time for most.\n\nHe was very upset with me for not even considering it. Because I'm the supervisor, I guess they think I make a lot more than them. But it's really not the case. I'm struggling like the rest of the working class.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think anyone should get mad at someone for not lending them money. You have the right to ask someone what ever you want. I just don't think you should expect things from people even during a trying time.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all of your comments. Turns out the guy wasn't even going to India. He asked a few other people and now there is a full blown investigation. I'm not sure if this is grounds for dismissal but at least he learned something from it. Hopefully.",

My dad left so speak with the meter maid. Meanwhile I was wondering what I should do to thank the homeless man. I didn’t have any cash and I didn’t see any ATMs. I saw my dad give the homeless man a dollar.\n\nI worried the homeless man would think we were stingy, selfish people who were so out of touch with reality that we thought giving a single dollar would make us white saviors. I didn't have cash but I did have a card. I bought him tea and 3 cookies.\n\nI made up a speech in my head to use when I gave the man his food. I kept repeating it in my head, trying emphasize how sorry I was that I didn’t have any money and that I hoped this food would be enough.\n\nMy dad disappeared while I was ordering the food and I freaked out so much I forgot to apologize for not giving money. The homeless man put down my food and drinks besides 5 other drinks he'd been given before. I felt ashamed, like my pathetic efforts to help were just another unwanted item that robbed him of the chance to choose for himself with money.\n\nI got into the car with my dad and angrily asked him why he left when I asked him to stay. He didn’t care at all that I’d been calling for him or that my hot tea burned my full hands when I got bumped by someone, looking for him. I told him I was incredibly upset and he told me not to be, but I wouldn’t stop. I kept saying, “Why the hell did you leave? It messed up what I was going to say. Stop leaving me all the time!”\n\n“Use your eyes to look for me, stop freaking out,” he said.\n\nI yelled, “I made myself look like a stupid, racist, out-of-touch white bitch with a savior complex who can’t even do one thing right!” and my dad turned to me and yelled, “Shut up! Shut up and be grateful. I’m paying for everything on this trip. You shut your mouth and quit talking.”\n\nI felt so bad that I burst out crying. I cried so hard I couldn’t even speak. It was just all stupid blubbering and it made my dad yell at me, \"Why are you crying? You have no reason to cry!\" Finally I blubbered out in a pathetic voice, “Please just give me a minute! Just a minute, God!” \n\nWe drove down the streets and I explained how ashamed I was that I couldn’t help at all and how I failed to use my privilege to actually help another human being. He told me I didn’t care about being a good person and that I was just doing it out of guilt. I told him I was upset because I should have done more and he told me I needed to quit being upset because I helped the homeless man and I couldn’t give him everything in one interaction. \n\nI still feel like a huge, worthless, unhelpful, privileged asshole who’s just one more idiotic white bitch who can't do anything to help.

We at first didn’t engage much, but then had to work together, and automatically became friends. \nSince then, we’ve been seeing and texting each other regularly, and it felt good to have found someone who is like the friendship equivalent of a soulmate. To say, after watching the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, we said that if we ever end up alone in our 40s, we will date each other. \n\nThings between us have always been easy. We were at first a trio, but the other girl, L (30F), has been a true pain. She knew D for a couple of years longer, and has seen me like the intruder in a way. She acted like she was my friend, but then would tell D how I was toxic for her, when really she was the one who was toxic, and trying to be D’s only friend and making her her property in a way. \n\nThis didn’t put a strain in my relationship with D, and more so, reinforced it. We had each other’s back. \n\nTwo years ago, I went through a really tough break up, and at the time D had gotten into a relationship with a very manipulative guy. He would dictate her every move, and was all around a bad guy. I warned her, and told her to break it off. She didn’t really listen, as I was very much in the slump and couldn’t possibly rationalise it all with her. \n\nShe ended up breaking up in February 2017, which was a relief for me, but then she spent the entire year crying about how much of a monster he was, although I had warned her multiple times that he was sucking the life out of her. \n\nThings didn’t get better, when she found out she had a strain of HPV that gave her condylomas, and the timing matched with when she was with that guy. I did my best to be there for her, and reassure her that it wasn’t the end of the world. Offered to be with her when she went to the gynaecologist, and also when she went to get them lasered off. I listened to her on the phone hours at the time, when she cried because of him, thought she would never be able to be with someone ever again, and beating herself about it all. She had zero self esteem at that point. \n\nI did what any best friend would do, and explained to her that all of this wasn’t true, that she wasn’t worthless, and will find someone who will be beyond her expectations. \n\n\nAll through it all, she barely inquired how I was doing. I was going through a shit year, and except some times when I would break down in front of her, she was basically inexistant. Never asked how I was holding up, never offered to cheer me up. I get it. She was going through her own stuff, and I couldn’t hold her accountable for it. \n\nSo I sucked it up. \n\n\nAt the end of 2017, she started seeing this guy, who was initially trying to get together with me, but I rejected him over and over, because I was still hoping my ex would come back, and truly, he wasn’t my type personality wise. I need someone who is very active, quick witted, who can make me laugh, and who isn’t in some sort of half asleep state all the time. \n\nBut anyway, the guy didn’t want a relationship, and was just profiting off her state to get sex, basically living at her place and not spending a dime when helping with groceries or anything. She even did his laundry. FFS. What king of man child is that. \n\nHere again, I told her he wasn’t a good fit for her, that he used her as a surrogate mother who would also have sex with him. She didn’t listen. She needed the attention and told me it felt great that he would be here at night to stroke her hair. Fine. \n\n\nThen he started dropping the ball continuously. \nThey established they would have a sort of open relationship. Except he knew first hand that she wasn’t going to act on anything because she was unable to trust men anymore. He is very socially awkward and although not ugly at all he still scared people off because he’s just weird at first. He used her weakness to profit from the situation. They said that the rule was no telling. She didn’t want to hear about who he thought was attractive, or who he fucks. \n\nBut he mentioned one girl, even had her name in one of his passwords, called her by her name, you know the drill. \n\nShe kept coming to me crying saying that he fucked up again. At the time, I met my now boyfriend and was doing so much better, so I was ready to be her clutch again although she wasn’t mine for so long. So I listened, warned her, again and again, even had my boyfriend explain that as a guy he thinks his behaviour is unacceptable and so on and so forth. \n\nShe didn’t want to quit it. I told her that she didn’t need to come telling me about those things because it would just make me mad. She still did. And I still listened. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she went on a trip, and she met this guy. They didn’t have sex, like no PiV but did everything around. I asked her why she didn’t go all the way when she recounted her nights with him, absolutely over the moon. And she said that she wasn’t allowed to “take off her clothes” when with someone else. Like. What ? She could do bj’s, get fingered, whatever else, but no PiV. I was mad. I didn’t know about this. How can you call this an open relationship ? Yeah you don’t. He’s profiting. Because she would excuse him for fucking someone all the way, but he would probably have thought it’s a deal breaker. Screw that. \n\nSince October, I’ve been very depressed. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely have sex with my boyfriend. I almost don’t eat anymore. Life is all together shitty. But yet again now, although I’ve told her, she doesn’t give a shit, or at least doesn’t try to be a friend to me. \nSo when she told me that her guy got upset because she “slept” with someone, I had enough. She was in tears saying that she fucked things up, and I told her I didn’t want to hear it. \n\nI went to leave, and she called me selfish. She doesn’t seem to realise that I have been suicidal, but I should somehow give a shit about her shitty relationship when I’m this down. \n\nI snapped at her and said that I don’t give a crap if she feels bad, because once again I warned her multiple times that this guy is a piece of work, and that she shouldn’t have agreed to anything with him if she wasn’t able to put up with it. \n\nNow I think our relationship is broken and there might be no going back unless she accepts that I’m also hurting in my own way, and have other things on my mind. She won’t apologise because she thinks I’ve overreacted, but I don’t see it. \n\nSo AITA for telling her to fuck off ? \n",

Sorry if this cuts too deep for some;  a NSFW tag is recommended or requested, I’ll add one, no questions asked.\n\n(Excessive backstory - skip to end if you want to save yourself a few minutes)\nAt the beginning of last spring break, my grandmother on my fathers side passed away due to medical complications resulting from old age and a history of rather heavy tobacco usage from her early teen years to shortly before her first pregnancy in her early thirties, let’s say twenty years. No condolences needed; it is a fact of life and I’ve since moved on completely.\n\nThis warrior of a lady’s death was expected but MASSIVELY sudden in a way. She had, over the course of nearly half a decade, brushed death, dodged death, experienced it for several seconds, and everything in between. If death were a person, she gave them a taste of their own medicine before giving up. This absolute unit of a human was pronounced legally dead a dozen times before she succumbed to a peaceful, endless sleep in her warm living room surrounded by her dog, my mother and father, and me.\n\nI’ll spare you the novel that I could easily write right now, but when she finally left us for good, I was overcome with... nothing.\n\nMy father and mother both were silent for a few painful moments before shedding any tears. I had seen my mom cry plenty of times, but my dad went from the most humble and masculine stereotype to a sobbing mess. However, it wasn’t just sadness. It was anger.\n\nI decided to excuse myself, as it was very late and I had school in a matter of hours. Before I could finish my sentence, my dad turned me to and said, completely un ironically, “Why did you even come down here in the fucking first place, Waynard_Ferguson?” \n\nThis was a bit jarring to me. My father didn’t particularly like his mother, and she wasn’t exactly what you would call a sweet old lady, so his attack towards me specifically was not expected.\n\nI explained to him in a stammering sentence that I wanted to be there for support and since I had been the only person there besides my mom (brothers moved out), that I would at least stay and offer my very real sympathy. This didn’t sit well with him, either.\n\n“You could’ve just told me the truth, and stay locked in your room like always. Had you not come down, I wouldn’t even know you were home!” this was delivered in not much less than a choked up, grieving whisper, but was deafening nonetheless. I looked to my mother, who didn’t speak, which was the right move in retrospect.\n\nAfter this, I didn’t really know what to say, or if I should even say anything. at all. He broke an uncomfortable eye contact with me after a few seconds, and told me in a hushed tone to go to bed, along with an assumption that I only wanted to leave because of my selfishness.\n\nLong story short, my father wasn’t mad at my predetermined lack of care for the situation, as he explained after his irrational state of grief passed. He was upset by my outwardly emotionless reaction to not just his mother’s death, but really anything related to the situation. It’s not that I didn’t care about my father and what he was going through. It’s just that I didn’t have the strong emotional connection that my father had, or anything close to it, to display that I was in fact emotionally moved by a VERY raw display of reality in front of me. I will admit, I didn’t cry or have a very strong reaction, if at all, to her death. I’m not sure why, I just couldn’t find it in me to be upset.\n\nTo be fair, she was quite the grandmother. She would insist on taking me to and from school regardless if my mom was or wasn’t going to, she would take me shopping for anything I needed with a seemingly endless supply of money, and wouldn’t show the slightest bit of irritation whenever I broke something of hers or said something stupid out of child ignorance. Not to mention, she would fix me meals fit for an entire family. She did this for not only me, but my two older brothers, and only stopped when she couldn’t breath on her own anymore.\n\nMy father, at the time, seemed to only think that I was leaving the room because I was uncomfortable being around him, and not really thinking about the fact that I just watched someone die for the first time.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not being upset from her death, and more specifically not feeling obligated to address her condition in a way that wasn’t dismissive? And this isn’t really asking if my dad was the offender, because he wasn’t. Is there something going on with me that would justify my lack of guilt or sorrow? Or am I just an unfeeling person? I left the room because I was uncomfortable, sure. But I was 17, exhausted, and just witnessed something not many people can easily forget about. ",

            "input": "This is going to be kind of long: I almost killed myself last March, and I attribute it 80% to my parents. \n\nStrike 1: My parents were an absolute disaster during my high school years, and any time they suspect that I feel this way, they go on about how there's no rule book and they were doing the best they could. They did have a reason for being disasters: my baby sister died at 3 months old due to complications from surgery. My dad became extremely controlling (he had to know where my sister and I were at all times, who we hung out with, even where we picked up new words/phrases), and my mom became extremely depressed. She wouldn't acknowledge that there was an issue, though, so I went through high school with a narcissistic and controlling father and a generally absent mother. This all shaped the rest of the issues I have, some of which are detailed below. \n\nStrike 2: I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high school, so my parents affected and controlled literally every part of my life. I was told what exactly to believe, commanded not to question it, and fed a bunch of bs that anyone who believed differently than my parents was evil and going to hell. My entire freshman year of college I honestly believed that being gay was one of the worst things that anyone could ever be. I met my best friend that year, a very awesome, very gay person. I later discovered that I am bisexual. I haven't told my parents, since they always go on about how their friends with gay kids are so strong to put up with the \"choices\" their children made.\n\nStrike 3: I grew up in an extremely conservative Christian home that gave little credibility to mental illness. I'd really like to think that when I started showing signs of depression at 15 a serious conversation about mental health and an appointment with a psychiatrist would have not lead me to almost kill myself at 19. My parents did give me options: I could go see a Christian counselor who would tell me to pray more and give my worries to God, like what my parents had already told me, or I could talk to the family doctor. I was sort of fed up with religion at that point, so I talked with the family doctor. She said it sounded like I was depressed and gave me a bottle of pills. She told me to come back if they weren't working. Looking back, this was absolutely not an appropriate response to what I was dealing with, and it took me years to figure out I wasn't supposed to feel down all the time.\n\nI've talked to many trusted people about this situation, including the fact that the only way I see ever being at peace is to never have to deal with the people who screwed me up this badly again. Initially, I wanted to completely disown them, and after talking it out more and thinking on it, my counselor even agreed it would be a good thing for me if it's what I still want. I know family is supposed to be forever and all that, but I haven't felt love for them since I was a very little kid, and it stresses me out enough to be around them that it can trigger a depressive episode and make me question my safety. I even ended up changing majors so I had to take summer classes just so I didn't have to be around my family all summer. I get depressed even thinking about going back for the holidays. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I sat them down, expressed my grievances, and told them I never wanted to see or hear from them again, for my own happiness and health? \n",

Always a little troubled, in and out of homes, but eventually she was living with her dad, but he was a bit of trouble, so she moved in with her boyfriend (J) and his family, but this meant moving 1.5 hours away from the main friendship group, essentially making her the \"left out friend\" (although she made no real effort to come see us). Fast forward about 6 months,  J’s dad received a job offer which forced his parents to move a further 2 hour drive east, so D and J could not do that due to work commitments, so they moved to an inner city apartment. D had no idea how to move her belongings, even refused to hire a truck so she basically begged a bunch of people. I was one of her only friends with a car so I was roped into doing some of the moving, although I didn’t particularly want to. For me it was a 1 hour drive to J’s place, then it was a further 2 hours back to their new apartment, and this trip happened 3 times.  Each time she did pay me $50 though. \n\nOne year later, her lease is up and has to move again. During the year contact was sparse with me and D, both busy with various things, then she pulls the same stunt as last year, although after realising how hard moving was, she ordered a truck, but still needed me and another guy to help her move. This time it was only 1 trip, but I was very reluctant to help as I remembered the horrors of last time (for reference she has severe OCD with her things).  So reluctantly I went and helped her, wasting my Friday night that I could have spent out with my friends. This time was not as bad as the other time but it went smooth enough were it wasn’t terrible. 1 hour drive up then a 25 minute drive to her new place, not as bad. But after it’s all said and done, we have a little get together with a few mates the next night and we come to the part where I may be the asshole. So she was just talking about money and debt she owes to people to my friend, and then she mentions that she owes me $50 for the move, then says I should have done it for free as we were friends. This was in reference to the other guy that helped her move, she had known him for about a year and he didn’t accept any payment, just food. I was taken aback a little as I know had the situation been reversed, she would not have helped me and my girlfriend move. My other mate jokingly agreed with her and she took it serious, and has been off with me ever since, but I wanna know your opinion. Am I the asshole for accepting money off a friend who I helped move even though she always complains about money?\n\nTLDR; helped friend move houses several times, received payment, but friends been off with me since another friend didn't accept any payment. \n",

My girlfriend's family tips large amounts, around 20% sometimes higher. On Saturday we went to a local restaurant.

She had to have a drink first thing in the AM and first thing when she came back from the university and nursed a buzz almost all day. She knew she had a problem and in her words was “waiting for some incident to give her a wake up call.” \n\nHer main job was a bar tending gig back in her home town 2 hours away on the weekends. 3 weeks straight I got snaps every night of the weekend of her driving drunk. Since she was mixing her anxiety and depression meds with alcohol, she blacked out pretty much after 2 drinks. She doesn’t remember our first 5 dates because of this and we both are speculating the only reason she blacked out so easily for a period of a few months when she went on new meds.\n\nOn top of all this, she was a “runner.” She’d be in a group of friends and just decide to take off. Not in a sprint, but casually say, “I have to go to the bathroom” and then leave the bar for us to try and track her down. This happened 3 times when I was with her.\n\nHer mentioning she needed a wake up call wasn’t too alarming to me. Loads of college students drink and I didn’t take her seriously about being an alcoholic. After the month of drunk driving snaps is when I realized this could end poorly.\n\nThe incident. \n\nOn one of the weekends she wasn’t scheduled to work, we went out for a late dinner with a mutual friend. She had been drinking all day and had 2 drinks at the restaurant when she became unresponsive and passed out in her seat in the restaurant around 9:30 or so. She had never passed out before. Blacked out-many times, but she didn’t sound inebriated or display any sign of drunkenness whatsoever in any of those situations. We were both pretty fucking embarrassed and I was a smidge angry to have to drag a passed out women from restaurant. The mutual friend that I had dinner with also was aware of my fwb’s drinking problems and that she was in a downward spiral. In jest, one of us had mentioned,\n\n“We should just drop her ass off in detox for alcohol poisoning so she can finally have her god damn wake up call. She wont remember the last 8 hours of today anyways. She will probably think a stranger dropped her off and would be none the wiser.” \n\nSo thats exactly what we did. I left and went home. She came to and sobered up there, and had no idea how she got there, or any recollections of the evening. I lied to her and said we got dinner and a few drinks, and then she ran off as she was prone to and we couldn’t find her. A week later or so, she got her hospital bill which was a few grand she couldn’t afford. I stopped seeing around this time, so I’m not sure if “she had her wake up call or not.” \n\nTLDR: dropped an alcoholic off at detox to give them a wake up call when I could have easily just taken care of them at home myself.",

Where we were eating, pictures, etc. After plans were put in place, I started to question if I was happy in the relationship. While not an extreme distance apart, it was still a fair commute. On top of the stresses and new experiences that college was offering I was finding that it wasn't worth sacrificing my happiness to remain in this relationship. However, I came to this conclusion just about a week before homecoming. At this point I was torn, I could've easily called her to let her know, but suddenly all the plans that were in place would fall apart and she would be left without a date on short notice. I could also just try to let her have one last week of happiness and then let her know after the dance. Out of these I chose door number 2 because i had already made a commitment to these plans and felt obligated to follow through with them.   \n\n\nSo the week goes by and I head home to prepare for the festivities. I do my best to act like nothings wrong. We go to dinner with some of her friends, have some laughs, eat decent food. Then we start making our way to the school. Apparently I'm not as good at acting as I thought, and she started to ask some questions. The usual, \"Are you OK?\", \"Is everything alright?\", and then finally as we pull into the parking lot and put my car into park she asks me in a scared voice \"Are you breaking up with me?\" In that moment I knew I was fucked. I had to answer honestly because if I lie and break up with her afterwords I'm a piece of shit. I told her that I didn't want it to happen like this, that i wanted her to have one last night where everything was alright and then tell her. Looking into her eyes I could see the pain she was feeling and I couldn't do anything to help in that moment. After a short conversation explain the why's and when's, we went inside and had as much fun as you could possibly imagine with a group of high school girls trying to kill me with their eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling I know a prevalent question that will be asked.\n\n\"So Pope, were there any other women you were romantically interested in or involved with?\"\n\nNo there were no other women involved in this decision. Just figured I'd save some typing for those who would ask.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Had a girlfriend, made plans for homecoming, week leading up to homecoming realized I wasn't happy, conflicted on how to break up, did it in person before her homecoming rather than a week earlier over the phone.  \n",

            "input": "  \n\nTLDR: My sister is angry because I suggested that instead of just shutting down the Go Fund Me her daughter started for her and sending the funds to the adoption agency because she changed her mind about adopting, she should post an update explaining this to the donors and giving them a chance to have their money returned if that’s what they wanted.\n\nI’m going to try to keep this short but include everything that could be relevant. I’ve talked with a few people close to me about it and they say I’m NTA but I want to hear some objective opinions and maybe get some insight into what might be going on from people outside of the situation.\n\nMy sister, we’ll call her Susan, is very angry with me/basically not talking to me after a conversation we had. I’m really hurt and don’t understand why. We’ve had issues in the past but nothing we haven’t gotten through, and I thought we were close.\n\nA while ago she decided to adopt a child from overseas, which can cost upwards of $35,000, and one of her daughters, we’ll call her Lisa, started a Go Fund Me (GFM) to fund part of the cost of the adoption. In general I don’t like GFM or the philosophy behind it. I think people should work for what they want, not ask other people to pay for it. Even though I’m a bleeding heart liberal in some ways, I have a Libertarian streak. \n\nHaving said that, it’s not always black and white and when Lisa started a GFM for an emergency dental surgery that sounded very scary over a year ago, I contributed to it, and I contributed to Susan’s adoption GFM in the last month because it’s a really good cause and adoptions are ridiculously expensive, but mostly because I love my sister and wanted her to feel supported. So I contributed to the first one because I was afraid my niece was basically going to die without the surgery (it was a huge tumor inside of her mouth, or something along those lines), and I contributed to the adoption one for the reasons I already stated. I will never contribute to another GFM again as long as I live.\n\nSusan asked me to forward the GFM page to friends/put it on social media. I told her I don’t have social media and she said what about Reddit? (because I’m always sending her stuff from Reddit). I told her Reddit’s not like that, or at least not the way I use it. But I was trying to think of different ways to help her raise money, like doing a raffle or a race or something. I wanted to do something more quickly though and ended up making a donation and sharing the link with several close friends, 5 of whom donated. This was very hard for me to do because I really, really don’t like asking friends to do this kind of thing. Like I said I don’t believe in the GFM mindset to begin with, and I don’t like putting friends in the position of saying yes or no. But I did it for my sister despite feeling very awkward and uncomfortable, which I never told her about. So this might be important—she never had a clue how I feel about GFM, or knew that it was difficult for me to ask my friends. No reason to tell her that and make her feel bad. Either donate happily without complaint, or don’t.\n\nFast forward to the conversation. We were talking on the phone about a week ago and she told me she’s been having a really hard time. Our whole family is sad right now because my other sister’s husband, our brother-in-law, an amazing, wonderful person, died unexpectedly three months ago. So we’re all grieving for him and for my other sister. Our dad died last December too and even though (or because) I wasn’t close to him, it’s been hard, and I’m sure to differing degrees that was hard on Susan, too. But the bottom line is Susan has been really sad and emotional. The reasons behind why she wanted to adopt and why she ultimately decided not to after all are related to trauma from her past that she’s still working through. There is a lot more to this but the bottom line is she’s having a hard time, and we talked about all of this for maybe over an hour. \n\nAs we were getting off the phone, I said “This is obviously not the most important thing about this situation, but can I ask what you’re doing to the GFM?” It’s in quotes because I worded it very carefully in my head first because I didn’t want her to feel I was discounting all the emotional things she's going through. She said that Lisa was the one who set it up and they were just going to shut it down and donate the money raised to the same adoption agency for the same child, but for the next person in line who wanted to adopt him. \n\nI suggested that they do a final post explaining briefly that the adoption wasn’t going to happen and what was going to happen to the money, so people would know. I told her I did not want my own money back at all, but that it would be nice to offer people their money back if that’s what they preferred, since although it was going to almost the same thing, it’s not exactly the same thing. Susan really didn’t seem to understand this and said that there was no way to make everyone happy. That even if they did make a final post explaining what they were doing, 50% of the people would still be unhappy. I said that might be true, but it doesn’t mean it’s not a good thing to do. I said that it’s nice when people donate money to let them know what happened to it, especially if what they initially donated for—in this case Susan adopting a child—doesn’t happen. \n\nSusan said she didn't think this way. That when she donates to a cause, she knows she's \"pure of heart\" and she has good karma and she doesn't worry about what ends up happening to the money. I said that's not how I approach donating at all. That when I donate to a cause, I'm \"pure of heart,\" too, but that I expect the money to go to what I was donating to and if it doesn't, I think that's fraud. Obviously she and I are on very different spectrums when it comes to charity, and maybe just in our approach to life? I don't know, maybe this is why I'm not understanding why she's so upset.\n\nI said that for instance what about the GFM that Lisa started for the oral surgery over a year ago? The last I heard, as of a couple of months ago when I last asked Susan, Lisa hadn’t had the surgery, and I hadn’t heard any updates. My sister said Lisa had just had the surgery yesterday. I am wondering if this is what upset my sister, that I was asking about that. But all I was saying was that people like updates and to know how the money was used. So she said she was going to check with Lisa and see if there was a way to return people’s money for the adoption GFM and I told her there was no rush. I told her again I did not want my money back, but I wanted to offer my friends their money back in case that’s what they wanted. \n\nSusan did not seem to understand AT ALL why I was so concerned about my friends. But I felt responsible. Susan said “But all you did was send them a link to tell them this was available to donate to if they wanted to.” I said no, that’s not the way it is at all. They could give their money to a million causes. They only donated to this one because I’m their friend and they care about me, and by virtue of that they care about her. So I felt responsible. She did not get that, not a bit.\n\nSo 5 minutes after we get off the phone, I realize none of this is necessary. I call her back and tell her I want to do the donation to the charity, so I will pay my friends back, explain the adoption isn’t going through and so we wanted to return the money. But it will be out of my pocket because I am totally happy to donate to this cause. But my sister doesn’t want to do that. She says she wants to talk to Lisa. Maybe 15 minutes later she texts me and says she’s sending me the money and a few minutes later I have the full amount in my account—the money I donated (even though I said I didn’t want it back) and the money my friends donated. I emailed her that I got the money but I don’t know why she returned my donation , too, when I told her not to. I also didn’t tell her to return my friends’ money—I just wanted to offer it back to them and let them have a say. They probably would have said not to worry about it. \n\nSo I feel like by handling it all this way she twisted what I asked for. I didn’t ask for my money back. I didn’t even ask for my friends’ money back. Just to offer to give it back if they wanted it. Why was that so bad? Why is it so hard to do a final post telling everyone who was kind and generous enough to donate what happened to their money? \n\nI told her about the site Go Fraud Me and how people use GFM to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars by doing things like lying and saying they have cancer. Not that she’s doing that! Of course not. Just that it makes people cynical. I said in the email that it’s my own personal conviction that when you accept money from people for a charitable cause, you have to be a good steward of those people’s money. I said it that way so she wouldn’t feel I was judging her. It’s MY personal conviction.\n\nBut still I felt really bad because I know she’s going through an emotional time, and so I dropped off a really beautiful bouquet of flowers for her later that day. She wasn’t home so I left them on her porch and texted her letting her know I left her something. The flowers were meaningful because she told me during the conversation about how this summer she made everyone a bouquet of flowers from her garden and not one for herself, and this is related to how she never takes care of herself. So I got her fresh flowers. About four hours later she hadn’t responded so I texted and asked if she got the flowers. A couple hours later she responded very coldly. “Yes. Thank you. I don’t want to talk and want to be alone.” So I’ve left her alone but I feel her cold treatment of me is really unfair.\n\nAll I did was say that people who give you money o",

We've been friends even before I started getting help, and we still talk though not as often as we used to. I try my best to support them during their episodes since they're either unwilling or unable to get help due to lack of time, money, or just the belief that it won't get them anywhere.\n\nSometimes though, it feels weirdly suffocating to talk to them. The dynamic we have just isn't the same and there are times when I feel like my mind's going back to a bad place when suicide gets brought up. I want to help them but the ways that worked for me either don't work for them or they're unwilling/unable to try, so I just don't know what to do and end up feeling helpless as well.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to slowly distance myself from them because of this?

(Also she knows I hate slime and can't touch it cause it's freaks me out what is one of the perks of me having Aspergers)\n\nToday she pushed me over the edge when I realized I got my period and it hit hard, blood was running right into my jeans so I rushed to the toilet but L pushed past me so I tried stopping her and said \"L stop I'm on my period and I'm bleeding through\" she looked at me laughed, Locked the bathroom door then said \"but I'm already in\" she proceeded to take as long as she could in the toilet, probably about 10 minutes. By the time she was out blood was all over my white jeans and I was fuming.\nSo I got a pad went and changed my underwear, changed my jeans for leggings. \nMy bloody jeans where Inside out so the blood was alot more visible I took them, went into L's room then did a perfect throw from the door to smack in her face. She looked shocked for a second, looked at me then looked at what hit her then screamed, like those movie scenes screams where wine glasses explode she also started crying and mom came in thinking she fell or something and then shouted at me although I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nDo you think I went a bit far?",

I lived in a small apartment by my self and had almost no savings. A friend of mine told me about online poker and casino games and how much fun he had playing. So I thought why not give it a try \nAt first I didn't find it amusing at all. I lost a couple of dollars and didn't think much about it. But when I got home from work I would always play for a small amount of money and one day a won a big price. (At least for me at that time). I think it was 500 dollar and that made me so happy because I really needed that money. Although I never cashed them out. I just continues playing until I lost it all again. After about a month or so I would put in all of my money to these online casinos and just continue to play until a lost it all. This quickly turned in to a bad habit and because my income was so low I almost didn't have enough cash for food. What i did was pretty stupid I know, but I was still a better option then to take a bunch of loans that would stack up. When I went to my mum's house (which was about every weekend) I would take money from her wallet and from her saving just finance my poker addiction. She had a well paid job and and probably didn't had a hard time just because I took a little money. But this went on for a long time and to this day I feel so bad for what I did.

She also came over while I was sick to hangout despite my warnings that she would also get sick, which she did. \n\nFast forward to now, she is sick.

I told her this and she got upset and we had a whole fight over it a couple of days ago. It was resolved mostly, and now today she again asked if I would have dinner with her tonight. Obviously, my answer was the same thing. She told me things like “it says a lot about a person how they act when you’re sick” and that I’m choosing a “5% chance of a cough over hanging out with her before i leave for training” and when I challenged that, she said she won’t argue about it and will see me in a few days. \n\nI get that she was really attentive when I was sick and I appreciate that, but it feels like she’s assuming I should act the same way regardless of circumstance.

            "input": "WARNING - this is a long one!\n\nOver a year ago now, I bonded with a guy in Guild Wars 2 that lived one state over from me in Australia. We got really, really close and in a drunken stupor I basically professed my love to him. We ended up dating, and it was great. We played together all the time, made plans to see each other IRL. It was only an hour's flight and not far enough that we couldn't handle it. We had some hiccups in the relationship, which is that I'm not a really expressive or overly affectionate person. This is a recurring theme, even though I tried hard to work on it because I wanted to be with him, and he had anxiety which made coping with it difficult if he didn't feel like I was investing enough. It's especially harder online because you can't be there physically with someone, so the feeling of emotional distance is amplified.\n\nGW2 was the one thing we shared, and I sort of drifted away from it. There was a series of small events and eventually I needed a break from the game, which is not uncommon for me. I've been playing on and off since release with a few year long breaks after burning out. I'm a very sarcastic and 'shit-talking' type of person. Everyone in the guild took what I said with a grain of salt. We insulted each other playfully and talked shit all the time. I found out later that a girl (she will be important later) in the guild felt like I'd been bullying her. We weren't close and even though I was treating her the same I did everyone else, she didn't reciprocate the same feeling of banter and took it to heart. I felt absolutely awful and tore myself up about it for a long time.\n\nI reached out to her and eventually we mended things, and I thought everything was okay. My bf and this girl ended up getting really close. She had bad depression and they bonded. I'm not the jealous type of girlfriend so I was perfectly okay with them ending up being best friends. Well, it turned out that she was basically in love with him. She flirted with him all the time, and they spent more and more time together. Even though I tried to get him to shut down the flirting, he didn't want to be mean to her or shut her down. It started to make me feel insecure, like I was competing for his time and not able to live up to this other girl.\n\nYou'll recall that I mentioned we were having problems in our relationship. He felt like I wasn't spending enough time with him, that I spent too much time with other people, but he didn't want to play any other game except GW2 even though I was super burnt out. Because video games are how we bonded and it was how we spent time with one another, I tried really hard to get him to try something else so we could play together. He didn't want to, and got upset when I was in calls and games with other people.\n\nWe ended up having a long talk where we discussed where our relationship was going. We mutually agreed that we might not last, but would give it a few more weeks to work things out. The thing that ultimately broke us was when I found out that he had been running a whole bunch of new content with her, even though I had been asking him to play with me so we could spend time together. He was basically brushing me off for her after complaining we didn't spend time together. On top of that, he said she had said things to him like 'you're just being with her because it's easy' and apparently purposefully trying to drive a wedge between us, and she kept flirting, but to my knowledge he never told her off for her behaviour and I didn't want to be 'that' girl who goes off at a boyfriend's female friend. He also made it clear that he wasn't going to stop being friends with her and didn't want me talking to her about it. It felt like he wasn't trying anymore, that he was being a hypocrite, and he just wanted her more, so I broke up with him.\n\nI left the guild because it was too hurtful being in the same one as my ex boyfriend and the girl who ultimately destroyed out relationship. I'd been in that guild for years and played with the people in it for a long, long time. I loved it there, and it was an emotional haven for me on some occasions. I felt resentful that I was the one who ended up leaving, even though I felt as though I'd done nothing wrong, and I still do. But I needed time to heal, and they weren't going anywhere any time soon, so I left. After I did, I sent the girl a rather... nasty message that went along the lines of 'are you happy now? you got what you wanted' and called her, I think, a 'homewrecking sl\\*t'. I was angry and hurt and lashing out, and I don't condone what I said, but there it is. No one said anything to me about it so I thought it might not have even been received (it had been).\n\nMy ex and I remained on OK terms. I owed him some money and was in the process of paying it back, our conversations were casual and pleasant. Once I did, he eventually removed me from social media and whatnot. I was a little surprised but got over it.\n\nIt's been over a year now, and I wanted to start playing GW2 again. I miss the people I played with and I'm ready to put water under the bridge, talk things out, maybe not be friends but at least be able to hang around each other. I reached out to my old guild leader a week and a half ago, who runs a Twitch stream and a public server. He said he was happy to welcome me back, but only on the terms that myself, ex and his now-gf (yes they ended up happily dating), are on okay terms since he didn't want things to be 'awkward'. I was really annoyed about this decision because I didn't (and still don't) think it's fair for me, and just me, to be excluded. I said that awful shit when I left, but I wasn't the only one who played a hand in how horribly everything turned out. I don't think it's fair that me joining back rests on my ex and his girlfriend.\n\nBut I reached out anyway. I've spoken to him and he basically told me 'why would we want you back?' and asked me if I remembered the message I sent his gf after I left. I said I did, but I was really hurt, and that I know it was childish. But I wanted to talk about it and hoped that we could at least settle things and talk about it like adults. I refrained from pointing out that he and his gf also helped to sabotage things and that I'm not the only one to blame for what happened because I don't want to cause a fight and ruin things again.\n\nHe told me it basically rests on his gf because I hurt her the most and whatever makes her happy makes him happy. I've sent her a msg but no reply. It's tearing me apart waiting. I feel awful thinking that they probably see me as this heartless monster but it makes me upset/angry, too, because that's not what I am. I refuse to believe that I'm the sole villain here and I feel like this situation is unfair. I'm willing to give them a chance and I would like the same in return.\n\nRegardless of whether or not I guess back in the guild, I am still going to be in the twitch server, where both of them also talk, so I don't see why it matters. We are going to be around each other anyway, and I would rather have us talk about the elephant in the room than avoid each other til the end of time.\n\nAm I crazy? Am I the asshole, an an asshole? Is it reasonable for me to want to come back after over a year to talk things out? Do you think they're being fair?",

He invited about 25 people to come over to celebrate/sleep over. The house has a heated pool and a hot tub, so we brought swimsuits. \n\nMost of the attendees are close friends of mine. My girlfriend of nearly 2 years has met many of them on multiple occasions. They're all super nice, respectful, &amp; intelligent adults...but, this group does like to have fun. In the past my gf has been uncomfortable in certain situations she isn't as used to as I am, so I explained to her what she might encounter at this party. I warned that things like people getting naked in the pool and MDMA use were a possibility. \n\n I said if she wasn't comfortable she didn't have to come. But if she did go, as I rarely get to see these friends, I just wanted to enjoy the party without worrying about her being offended by everything. She promised that she would be fine and wouldn't start any arguments.\n\nWe get to the party, everyone has a great time. Some people do end up rolling but its mostly pretty tame. Around 12am I tell her I want to go in the hot tub. She didn't really want to go in, so I suggested I could just go in without her.\n\nThats when she says: \"if theres half naked girls in there you're not getting in\". I protested, its just my friends in the hot tub. And if people want to get naked thats on them, we're all adults.  To which she responded, \"I don't want you perving on any naked girls. If you respected me you wouldn't go in\". I assured her I wouldn't be \"perving\" and didn't see the big deal. She was welcome to join, and should trust me regardless of whose in there. (To be clear, nobody was actually naked). She then got upset and went into the bedroom alone. She later changing her mind and went in the hot tub with me (probably to \"babysit\" me)\n\nThis isn't the first time we've had a hot tub disagreement. About a year ago with friends on a ski trip, some of the girls didn't have suits so they just went in in their bra/thongs. Nobody else cared. But my gf started shooting daggers at me and was angry the rest of the night. She later told me \"that was so inappropriate, those girls have no respect doing that around people's boyfriends\". I disagreed, which sparked an argument.\n\nAlso later at the 30th bday, a bunch of us were talking in one of the bedrooms. Two of the girls (who are bi) started playfully kissing each other on the bed. I glanced over but didn't stare or anything. My gf gave me an angry look and said \"what do you think you're doing?\". I was confused. \"You're really not going to look away?\". She walked off upset.\n\nAITA for not finding these things disrespectful?\n\nTo preface...she's always known I had a bit more of an \"alternative lifestyle\" during/post (lots of music festivals, burning man, psychedelics, etc). I was always open with her about my liberal views &amp; experiences. Shes always *claimed* to accept that about me.\n",

I feel that I'm at capacity currently (with life's current events/adulting) and am on edge.\nI feel at times that many things I do are not right in her opinion or just irritate her. Today has been no exception.\n\nStarting at 5:30am, our 1yo wakes and is crying. I get up to help and wife asks that I just try to soothe rather than bring to her for early feeding. I do this, but baby begins to scream again. I thought wife says to bring baby to her and she will feed, but I guess I misheard her. She gets mad and says that I'm messing up the sleep training. I'm hurt by her frustration, but just lay back down.\n\nAnother moment from today: \nFamily is getting dressed and ready to go out for the day. I put on t-shirt I received for Christmas and an old baseball hat. Wife looks at me funny in disapproving way. While in another room, I hear her say in a gameshow voice, \"the whole family gets dressed nice and you decided to wear stupid shirt that says boats &amp; hoes and that awful baseball hat\". I ask if she was planning on taking family pics while out, she says no. I tell her I'll change since she disapproves, and she says don't... I tell her she's being passive aggressive and she says she's just joking and where the hell has my sense of humor gone?\n\nAnother instance: \nI'm speaking with her quietly in bathroom. She says, shhhh! The baby is sleeping. Ok, fine, but I was already taking quietly for that reason.\nA few moments later she shuts a cabinet and it makes a loud squeak and slam. I say shhhh to her as well. She then calls me passive aggressive and says I obviously had an issue with her telling me to be quite earlier, but that she didn't want the baby to wake.\nI agree and say that nobody likes to be shhh'd, but also agree that nobody like to wake the baby even more.\nFrom there the situation spirals and the specific details are blurry, but I'm told that I'm miserable, unhappy, need to figure out what my deal is, to get a life and find my happiness. I have been accused by her multiple times that I must really hate her and the life we have created.\nShe then decides that we need to split for the day, taking the kids out on our planned outings and for \"me to do me\" and figure my shit out.\n\nShe is out with the kids now and I am confused. I know that I am not innocent, as it takes two. And yes, I'm in kind of a funk right now. But it also feels like she is taking shots at me, perhaps out of irritation that I'm not 100% my chipper self. \nFunny thing is, I really believe that the things she accuses me of are some of the shortcomings and character defects that she possesses herself. If I try to communicate that to her, the whole conversation usually gets turned around to how I am guilty of all the things I tried to discuss with her. It feels like a vicious cycle of just going tit for tat over trivial points and arguing for the sake of arguing. And I hate it. It really makes me sad...\n\nNot sure if this is the right forum for this, but the feedback here seems to be good, offering great perspective.\n\nSo am I the asshole here, do I need to pull my head out of my own ass, or is there something else perhaps?",

I was completely fine with it, because we both worked an equal amount of hours. Even though I earned a fair bit more, I was home for roughly the same time as her and all was good. \nIt was going great till 2 months ago, I got an opportunity to become a key member of an emerging company.

Her mother called her step brother to tell him, who lives in Mexico about how he has passed away. Since it was rough for my gf I stayed over for a week to help her grief and support, but her uncle that she only saw once when she was around 5 years old kinda imposes himself to sleep at my girlfriends moms house for a week (lived in small 2 bedroom appartement). Me and gf are both students and broke  and had to buy own groceries since her mom did not buy us food and we had to cook for ourselves. This guy arrives and is so cheap he is ready to sleep a thin blanket in the living room floor instead of renting out cheap motel. No one including step mom really wanted this guy over but she felt obliged since he insisted on helping to organize the funural. Hes been here for at least 2 days if my memory is correct and hasnt bought himself any food, mother in law does not buy us and just buys herself frozen micro wave meals since shes to lazy to cook herself. One day after we did the groceries, he was out. Im making shepards pie. When he arrived he doesnt even ask us but expects us to give him some shepards pie but the leftovers was for our lunch the next day while we were at school and we paid for it. Later on he bought himself bananas (he finally bought himself a few things to eat at like day 4 of the week) and states they are his bananas. And he still ate some of our food which we made clear to him he could not have since hes a grown 50 year old man who should be able to buy himself some food and not need 2 18 year olds buy it for him but he made me feel kinda like an asshole so AITA?

We spent some time apart and I realized that I still wanted him in my life. Long story short, we got back together. Throughout the relationship, he was very rude, uncaring, and inconsiderate towards me. I would always let him walk all over me because I knew he was in a tight spot with his family at the time but it still hurt whenever he would insult me or do other generally not so great things. I finally decided that it was time to end the relationship because I just did not love him like I had used to, and I explained that to him as best as I could. For the weeks after, he threatened suicide, self harm, and other terrible things. He had been one of my best friends as well as a boyfriend, so I would try to be there for him. Due to what he calls “his bad state of mind” he treated me even worse to the point where I’d stay up crying thinking it was my fault for putting him in this terrible situation.

I see him later in the week with a gash going up his wrist, and decide that he needs me there for him.

We work together have similar interests and world views. We had also been living together for the past 2 years. Up until recently I actually looked up to him and thought he was honestly the most well rounded person I had met around my age.\n\nA little over a year ago I started dating my SO (21F) a few months in for convenience she essentially moved in. Things had been going pretty well but we started having some issues but we were keeping it together. As background for the upcoming story she is also easily the biggest lightweight I have ever known. anything past 4 regular light beers and she starts getting trashed. \n\nSo about a month ago we're all drinking sitting in the living room and I've gotten to the point where I want to taper off and start going to bed. It's around 2 or 3am and my SO has work the next day while I do not. I recommended she come to bed so she doesn't feel too bad in the morning. She's also getting to that point of no return level of drunk where shes slurring pretty heavily, laying in awkward positions, and general tells of someone being very intoxicated.\n\nShe tells me she thinks she should just stay up at this point so she doesn't accidentally sleep through her alarm. I guess that makes sense I tried to convince her otherwise but generally shrug it off and go to bed.\n\nI woke up the next day and everything seemed alright but my SO eventually came up to me later in the day and explained that her and my best friend and fooled around the night before. I was upset but I've been cheated on before so I wasn't hopelessly crushed. I went to my best friend in the other room and asked him what happened he tried to say they only made out. She told me different but I didn't let him know that. I also asked him if he planned on telling me and he shrugged his shoulders and said hey man I dunno its awkward.\n\nOver the next few days the SO filled me in on some more details that I asked for to get a better grip on the situation.\n\nEssentially most of the time was harmless till he came over started putting the classic moves that you do then proceeded to talk badly about me and how I am including some stuff that feels completely made up while he talked her up about how nice she's been ya know... the classics. She was the one to eventually stop what they were doing and walk away.\n\nI condensed alot of it but if the specifics of what happened are needed I can edit it in later or make another post later.\n\n\\---------------------(What I have done)\n\nSo knowing all that I can tell you how I've been handling it.\n\nFor my best friend I've done everything I can to avoid seeing him or acknowledging him in the apartment. I've made plans to move out as soon as I have the place available I'm gone. I felt I gave him his chance to explain his side and he shrugged his shoulders. He also didn't say another word or even a sorry till 3 weeks later while he was shitfaced. I can forgive mistakes even monumental ones like that but lying about it then not planning on telling me and the way he went about it just seems sleazy and malicious. also he is quite a heavy drinker so he can handle his drinks and he wasn't that bad off when I went to bed.\n\nFor the SO at first I told her to be moved out by new years. She was honest she knew she fucked up and she hated herself for it. She beat her self up enough so I was perfectly content with acting like nothing happened until she moved out to allow her to have a smooth transition. Recently though we have been talking about possibly working things out and I'm just very unsure of it. \n\nOn one hand she was honest with when in reality that's a hard thing for most people to admit to someone knowing full well you'll earn nothing but that person's anger and hate in return. On the other honesty can't get you out of everything nor can alcohol as an excuse and if we continue on it will be very hard for me to remember this and have it lorded over her when she might be acting shitty towards me. I know that isn't right but I'm human too and I don't know how I might feel later down the road. I also feel that maybe the part that wants to work on it is just being weak afraid of being alone after losing the only 2 people I really interact with outside of work. If that's so then that's unfair to her.\n\nI've talked to some friends at work about it which is the closest petty thing I've done to the best friend however I legitimately wanted their opinion (2 older males) but part of me did feel like I was exposing a fraud. They were surprised considering how close we we're but they think I should give him another chance or some sort of leniency.\n\n\\-------------------------(TL;DR)\n\nSo after all this AITA for completely shunning my best friend while forgiving my SO and possibly letting her back into my life fully",

I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn’t find them.it wasn’t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because “I dunno I just like the taste of them.” \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn’t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I’m going to drive out to her college. I’ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must’ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I’m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.",

            "input": "5 years ago in high school I ended a 3 year long relationship with a girl (called C). C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? ",

She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?",

For reference, the first floor is classrooms, second floor is a talk friendly study place, third floor is a quiet study place, and fourth floor is the computer lab.\n\nIt is my understanding that there is an unspoken rule that unless you are working on a group project and need to talk with others to get your work done, the computer lab is also meant to be a quiet floor.\n\nI had been at my computer for a while doing some required reading when another student walks in playing music on his headphones loud enough that I could hear him from across the room (maybe 50 feet away). He sits down and proceeds to look at his phone, not logging in to the computer and not turning the volume down for maybe 5 minutes. At that point I got up, walked over to him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said “hey man, can you turn your music down? It’s hard for me to focus”. He looks at me without saying anything, and after a moment he turns his music down and I go back to my seat.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes or so he walks up to me and asks if I worked at the library. I told him I didn’t, and he responded “why did you ask me to turn my music down”. Being socially anxious, I nervously said something along the lines of I’m sorry if I offended you but it was really distracting. He kinda shook his head in disbelief and then walked out of the lab. AITA?\n\nSome more information that I didn’t know where to put in. \n - There were maybe four other people in the lab at the time including one campus employed student who was there to help with IT problems. Non of them said anything or seemed to notice any of this take place (as in it didn’t distract them).\n - The headphones he was using looked like the old generic apple headphones, which if anyone has used them knows that they become miniature speakers past half volume. His music wasn’t loud, but it was noticeable enough that I could hear the baseline and a bit of the melody.\n - I had headphones visibly on me (phone in pocket, headphones going through the shirt out of the neck) but I was not wearing them because my own music was distracting me from the reading.\n - There are some computers on the second floor, but they can’t be used to access canvas, a site many teachers use to post assignments and grades.",

I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. ",

One of the girls I met was 35 and wanted to come over to my place at night after a very minimal amount of chatting. I figured it was a classic bootycall. She came over, we had a good time, had drinks, and as expected she stayed the night. And that's where my fuck-up happend: I don't want to blame the excessive amount of alcohol (I'm pretty good at handeling my drink, but drank over 6 beers before she even came over, drank a lot more with her) but for some reason I was a fucking idiot and didn't use protection. \n\nThe next morning I realized this was a major fuck-up and went out to get us breakfast and got her a morning-after pill. She took it, we had breakfast, she told me she didn't have any STD's (which I wasn't so sure about given how easily she slept with me) and she left. (It later turned out she didn't give me any STD's btw).\n\nI ended up seeing her 4 more times in the next two weeks (I made sure to use condoms every time) - we always met at night, and I was very clear about not wanting a relationship - she said she didn't either. After those two weeks I kind of got my life together a bit more and wanted to quit casual hookups to go after this other girl that I was really in love with. So I broke up with her - and she took it HARD. Talked about wanting to commit suicide and stuff. I recommend her some people/telephone numbers/anonymous chat organisations that could help her and broke off contact. \n\nOver the next two months she occassionally (drunk) texted me to tell me she wanted to date again. I kept saying I was over it, that I had moved on and that I didn't want any contact anymore.\n\nFast forward another month: she texts me pictures of an ultrasound, telling me she had become pregnant by me and had a miscarriage. I'm not sure if the pictures are legit - but there's a date on them that fits the timeline. I realise the morning-after pill doesn't have a 100% success-rate but she did get her period about 1,5week after the unprotected sex. Always used condoms after that first time. \n\nNow she keeps blaming me for everything. I figured I'd go with believing her story, had a convo via texts about how I'm really sorry this happend, that it was never my intention and that I should've used a condom that first time. However, she keeps saying I'm a horrible person for breaking it off with her, how it's unfair that I continue with life while she's had to deal with this, that she's mad and believes I treated her like a toy, and so on.\n\nI obviously feel bad about the whole thing and would like to hear your opinions. \n\nPS: I know I really fucked up having  unprotected sex with someone I just met an hour ago, after months I'm still mad at myself about it, but is there anything I could've done better after that fact?

Since the beginning there were several things he used to do that’d make me feel uncomfortable. i.e. we different taste in music and if I posted a song on some social media he’d comment “that’s garbage” or “trash” just to let me down. \nThere’s also a huge festival in my city every year that’s basically a whole month (June, for Saint John’s) with lots of concerts and dancing and stuff. All my friends go to this place for this festival every year and I really wanted to go when we were together but he told me he didn’t wanna come and that he’d be mad at me and stop talking to me if I went there with my friends. \nHe was also selfish when it comes to do things I wanted do and would only go to places that only he wanted to go and I had to come with. But he’d make a total of 0 effort to be with me when I wanted to go somewhere, and I couldn’t go by myself either. Plus, he was cheap and if I bought anything with MY OWN MONEY he’d tell me I’m spending too much money and that I didn’t need whatever I was buying even though it was MY MONEY. \nLong story short, around Christmas I had enough when he told me he was going to buy a brand new and special edition of the War and Peace collection, by Tolstoy and he knew I wanted to read this collection for a while now and he already had a collection himself. When Christmas came I was really excited and he came to my place with my Christmas gift: his old collection of War and Peace he’d no longer need because he bought himself the new special edition. I mean, HE BOUGHT HIMSELF THE NEW COLLECTION AND GAVE ME THE OLD ONE HE ALREADY HAD FOR CHRISTMAS.\nBy that time I had enough. For everything that was wrong with the relationship that made me uncomfortable and now this. It wasn’t the gift itself that made me upset, but the fact that he put 0 effort on my gift. He just needed someone to get rid of his old collection to and thought I’d be the perfect person to get this.\n\nAITA?",

My bf is kinda the typical frat bro and honestly nothing from the outset screams anything but heterosexual, so when we started dating I assumed he was straight.\n\n About 6 months in he mentioned that he had a \"bate buddy\" in college, so I replied \"oh who was she? Did you date\" and he just laughed was like \"it's not a she\". I'm bi myself so it wasn't a big deal at all to me, but I definitely was shocked so I told him I didn't know he was bi, to which he laughed and said he was \"100% straight\" and it was \"just a guy thing\". I obviously thought it was an odd excuse but I grew up with all girls so I don't know much about guys so I just left it alone.\n\n\nSo shortly after that we were having sexy times and he wanted me to describe my past romps with woman, so I ask him about his past \"bate buddies\" and he gets really quiet and admits that sometimes they went further than just masturbating beside each other and goes on to tell me that he's done just about anything you could think of with another guy a couple times. So I made a lighthearted joke about it; something along the lines of \"should I be worried another guy is going to take you away from me\". He didn't get mad but I could see he was a bit upset by it and just kept saying that he's straight and he was just experimenting but he doesn't have any interest in guys. \n\nSo today I ask to use his phone to quickly buy something online because mine broke so when I opened it I'm greeted by gay porn. He snatched it out of my hand and laughs but was obviously embarassed I say to him that they're is nothing wrong with being bisexual and I don't care if he watches that type of porn. He just kinda blows up and insists he's not bisexual and that he's tired of me trying to say he is. I really really tried to explain to him there is nothing wrong with it and I'm nit trying to but labels on him but I think he should just accept it if he's okay. But he just got even angrier ans stormed out.\n\nI feel super bad about it but I honestly just want him to be comfortable with who he is. I used to deny I was bi so it's a bit personal to me. I also think that the reason he won't admit it is because his dad left his family for another man so I think it might be some internal hostility (even through they have a very good relationship now)\n\n\n\n",

I didn't want to ignore her, but I was pretty much very annoyed so I still calmly said you're just forcing me to talk and its making it worse to which she replied that she didn't know how trying to handle the situation is making it worse and asked why I was thinking like that. \"I don't have anybody else except for you to talk to\", that's what she said.

All i asked for was time and space which isn't even much as I said I'd text her back in the morning and it was 9 here already. She said \"Go on then, text me back when you're mood is good. What can I do? Me speaking seems to only make the situation worse and annoy you.\" She said this in our language with much respect so this was very sarcastic and this is only a rough translation. I was pretty annoyed. I said you don't have to say that as a reply to her \"take rest\". So she started to rant again \"Who am I to you anyways.. and blah blah blah\", so I just blocked her for now.\n\nI will text her back in the morning but I don't know if what i did was a good approach to this situation. I don't even know if the title is right for this but I'd really appreciate you guys' take on this. Thanks.",

I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me.

If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant.

Things are clearly heating up, and I'm slowly getting mad and excited, even though I still remain quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game ends, my mom and I are heading out, while my father waits inside gymnasium for my brother.

I overhear them trashtalk my club one too many times, and it makes my blood boil. I open the car's door and tell my mom I'm going to see them. I call the other team's coach, and tell him that I reckon he's being pretty arrogant for a coach that didn't see his team win a single game the year prior, and lose every week-end by 40 to 10. By the time I end my sentence, my mom has jumped out of the car, stepped in and is insulting the coach. I know she's short-tempered and really hot-headed, so I'm considering holding her back ; but the coach is already getting inside his car. I turn around and start walking towards our car, certain my mom is right behind me, but after a few steps I hear them both still arguing. When I look back, my mom has opened the coach's car, and she's almost stepped in yelling at his face. I'm pretty paralysed at this point, still very stirred up.

After three months of our relationship, we shared our first kiss and it all went downhill from there. \n\nAfter our first kiss, he started wanting things from me, specifically sexual favors. He would constantly ask me for a blowjob and I would always refuse. Eventually, he would start pulling his dick out and making me touch it and pleading me to suck it. I was VERY uncomfortable with this, and he managed to convince me that I was a bad girlfriend for refusing to blow him.\n\nHe would also constantly try to touch me, but most of the time, I gave the excuse that I hadn’t shaved down there and he would leave it be. Once though, I did shave before hand, because for some reason, I thought I would be ready. When he came over that day, I realized I wasn’t and told him not to. He shoved his hand down my pants anyway. As. I. Told. Him. No.\nI remember pulling his hand out of my jeans and him brushing it off and smelling his fingers to tell me that I smelt good. I don’t remember what any of the other encounters were that day, just that specific memory.\n\nI was really starting to get into feminism at this point, and joined my junior high’s gay straight alliance. We had this event called the GLSEN Day of Silence where students were supposed to wear black and pledge an oath of silence for the day to protest against bullying and harassment of lgbt+ students. People would ask why I was joining and I wrote down a cute pie chart of how much I felt I was attracted to boys vs. girls and a title that said “I’m Bisexual! :)”.\n\nThis was my first time coming out to any of my friends, and it was the first time I told my Ex. He read the note, looked up at me, read the note again, and then with the face of Joseph when Mary first told him she was pregnant, he said “You’re bi?”.\n\nWe had an argument over FB messenger on the way home from school. He told me he couldn’t date a bi girl because I was more likely to cheat on him. That’s when we broke up.\n\nOver the summer, I met someone new and started a long distance relationship with said person. I was happy with him... then the flashbacks came. I don’t know why, but that memory of my ex shoving his hand down my pants started to constantly play, and I would panic attacks over it. Luckily, my new bf was supportive when I told him what happened and would even call when I’d have panic attacks so I could calm down. \n\n I didn’t tell my parents that it even happened until a year after my ex and I broke up. At the end of 8th grade, I told all of my friends what happened and many took my side (but some still hung out with him afterwards)\n\nRight before Freshman year, I contacted him on social media and we had a nice conversation. He apologized for what he did to me and promised that he would never do that to another girl again.\n\nAnyway, here we are present day.\nLast night, a girl contacted me (Let’s call her A) and told me that her BFF (B) is dating my ex, and she wanted to know if that was the same Ex that had sexually assaulted me. I told her yes, then proceeded to answer any questions she had, as well as tell her my full story.  \nA tells me that B has admitted that my ex does sexual things to her without her consent but she is “okay with it” (A thinks she’s lying). A said that she gets a really bad vibe from my ex, and that she thinks that he may be doing similar things to B.\n\nThat makes my blood boil and want to confront this girl and tell her to break up with him as soon as she can because I don’t want another girl to go through the same trauma that I did!\nBut at the same time, what happened to me happened when we were technically kids, and I don’t feel like it’s my lane to sabotage his relationships. I fear that it will make me seem jealous and I’ll be known as his “crazy ex”\nIdk, should I talk to B? Should I let her know of the monster that her boyfriend was when we were together? Have I slandered his name enough just by telling our friends about what he did to me? Am I an asshole for not putting the whole thing aside  and moving on with my life? \n\n\nTDRL: My “ex boyfriend” sexually assaulted me when we were 13 and now we’re in HS and I suspect that he’s doing the same to another girl even though he told me he wouldn’t. I told our friends about him and part of me feels like I slandered his name enough but the other part of me wants to protect other girls from him.",

I binge drink sometimes, self-medicating sedative for sure, but pot's more my deal and I love how it helps me create and be up, optimistic and engaged, whereas drinking numbs my issues and just shuts me down. Socially, I drink more, part of the flock, but, when I'm home, I largely avoid it to remain productive and would love to quit entirely, no judgement on anyone who relies upon the drink to get them through. I understand.  I'd just like to stop, altogether. \n\nMy wife drinks too, but not really socially, more like constantly.  It's been every night for years.  Happy times, sad times, all times, a bottle of wine a night.  I know of issues she has, and I understand how self-medicating works. But she has always shown such a lack of interest in trying to rein it in. I don't push - I get it.  But it started to attack her health, and she gained weight, her health deteriorating over many years of nightly pounding the wine down, along with questionable dietary habits. I ride mountain bikes, walk a lot, work out, and she just doesn't want to be active, for whatever reason, I still don't know what that block might be.  \n\nFortunately, our doctor confronted her with a diabetic prognosis, as a result of her weight gain from both food and alcohol abuse as well as physical inactivity and she had a woke moment and decided she needed help.  So, she got gastric bypass surgery as a way of forcing her to pay closer attention to her health.  She would have to follow a dutiful regimen because of the surgery.\n\nIn a year, she lost 125 pounds, and I've been so proud of her.  She's been ecstatic, glowing, excited and empowered.  I've loved watching her rediscover life and have shared in all of her victories day by day.  Our marriage has strengthened as we've affirmed that we were in this together.\n\nIt's well-documented that there are some psychological side-effects that come from this kind of surgery and that also, many still revert to their old ways in time.  My wife has been a model patient, defying all of the standard results for this procedure.  No complications, a tremendous boost of energy and dedication to remaining fit and the realization that she'd committed to a life-long lifestyle.  I told her from the start that I'd be there with her, side by side and step by step as she redefined her approach to physical and mental well-being.\n\n9 months after the surgery, she stopped working out so much, very much pleased with her progress, and then she dropped right back into drinking heavily again.  But, her smaller stomach couldn't process the booze as well, so she began getting drunker quicker and more severely.  This progressed to full-on drunk-every-night sessions that would leave her on the couch, head hanging forward, dead to the world, full-on passed out.  I'd never seen her like this before.\n\nWe'd go out somewhere and we'd both be ordering drinks, but she'd end up wrecked in half the time, and we'd often have to bail on our plans in order to get her home.  She was stumbling drunk every time, and she had to lean on me extensively as we aborted date nights to get her back home where she could pass out in private.\n\nI thought I was getting my wife back when she got the surgery, but there are issues that continue to press her towards the booze.  I recognize my own issues with the drink and have decreased my usage over the past few years, especially at home, where we could support each other.   I've told her many times that I would stop drinking completely if she would do the same.  Because the two of us are stronger together than each of us alone.  If both of us are of like mind on something, there's no stopping us.  We're like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis at the end of \"True Lies\"; working the room together and owning it.\n\nI told her again, tonight, that I would cut back on drinking if she would.  Together, we'd get a handle on this thing.  We didn't have to stop drinking forever, just maybe not as much. I'm ready.  She said that she wasn't quite ready, yet.  The same thing that she's been telling me for years.  I went alcohol-free for a year, for myself and to serve as a witness.  She didn't change her intake one bit.  I got something out of it, some lucidity, some better habits, a sense of control that I didn't think I possessed.  But she didn't share that depth of attempt. And it was hard to quit cold turkey in a house full of booze.\n\nI'm willing to dial it down to zero and she's not willing to dial it down at all.  I know she's dealing with a lot of baggage, from childhood to some of the mindfucks that come with the surgery that she endured a year ago.  I don't blame her for drinking.  I just don't know what to do in the face of her saying, \"I can't stop right now.\"\n\nShe was very sweet when I told her all of this.  We're not arguing.  I asked her if she's happy and she said, exuberantly, \"yes!\"  I'm happy too; she's a wonderful woman. We have fun, we have a great relationship, we enjoy each other's company, it'll be 15 years of marriage next year and 17 years of being together. But something is compelling her to drink in excess seven days a week, and I just don't know what to do.  \n\nAnd because I DO drink, and know WHY I do and tell her so, but refrain from the intense levels at which she imbibes, I just wonder if I'm being an asshole.  Do I even have room to speak?\n\n",

She replied in an offended tone, ‘Glad to see where his priorities lie’. I asked her what she meant by this.

When we first kissed, we had been hanging out for a majority of the day; we were definitely “cuddly” and flirty to the point where it felt like we were dating, which is something I wasn’t really comfortable with. As I was leaving her room that night, she was the one to lean in first. I was a bit taken aback because I hadn’t really known her for that long — so I told her after we kissed that I wanted to take things slowly. She says ok, everything’s fine, we make out again a day or so later.\n\nNow here’s what happened.

When I get back to my room, I turn on my phone and I see the missed messages from her saying that she would be outside my classroom’s building waiting until my class ended with cookies she baked me for my birthday.

I have been in relationships before and this sort of stuff didn’t happen too often, let alone in the first week.

After this incident, I mostly stopped talking to her, and didn’t continue hanging out with her until the whole thing fizzled out.

About a year ago I found an old tin with my pokemon cards in it.  They were all curled and dusty from age so they were all worthless. After finding them though, I started to get back into collecting them. \n\nI dont have that huge of a collection now but I do have a few nice cards that Ive pulled that I keep in binders in my attic.

My parents went through the attic to find any of my old art supplies they could find for him to keep himself busy.\n\nThen though, they started pulling out my binders of cards to show and probably give him. I got kind of lucky and walked downstairs immediately after he opened the first binder to look and I just said something along the lines of “Just remember, please only look at them and don’t take any”. And he said okay and that was that. It was just me and him in the room. \n\nAbout a week later my mom knocked on my door and asked if my cousin could have my cards. I said he can look at them but I really dont want to give them to him. We bickered so we just made a deal that I would give him a couple of them. We went through them together and I gave him some cards that I had duplicates of that he wanted, and I actually probably gave him about 60 different cards. So you know, a decent amount to an elementary schooler. Again, all was fine. This happened in the early summer of 2018. \n\nAlso, I told my mom later why I didnt want to give them away. \n\nLast week, my cousin came and knocked on my door and asked if he could have my cards or if “I still liked them”. I apologized and said that I did still like them, and he said okay. I learned later that he came down the stairs dissapointed. Ever since then my family seem to be annoyed with me.  I asked my mom about it and she said that nobody could understand why I wouldnt just give the cards to him, and I explained to her that I had spent money I earned at my job on many of the cards and I actually use (trade / sell / play) them, and they probably would just sit on his shelf. \n\n\nTLDR; my elementary age cousin wants Pokémon cards that I bought and my family is annoyed at me because I dont want to give them to him. \n\n\nSo AITA?

S blew her top and muted me and started screaming that I was worthless and a piece of shit, not giving me a chance to defend myself. S knows fully well that this triggers my PTSD and I go non-verbal. Nobody can get a peep out of me once my flashbacks start. \n\nfast forward a few minutes after she stops yelling, and I manage to quell my flashbacks enough to pass off ownership of the server, and I leave.

He left with threatening me that he would just \"throw out my stuff\" the next time if I don't add my floor level to my address.   \n\n\nMy perspective on this is as follows:  If a floor level is an absolute requirement for delivery, this should be a mandatory data field when using this delivery service. But it isn't: If you order from smaller online shops, there sometimes isn't even an entry field for that, or at least you would need to \"abuse\" one of the other fields like \"company name\".   \nIf this is a problem during delivery because it takes them too much time to read off the recipients floor level off the doorbell, then that is an issue that they should tackle internally within the delivery company, but not by blaming the customer for not making an additional non-mandatory entry in the address.  \nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I also have Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, with which I get seizures only if I am sleep deprived. Awakening startled from sleep is the #1 trigger for a seizure. But, he doesn't know this. I've actually never even spoken to this person, I just pass him in the hallway, at which point he avoids my gaze. Tried to be friendly but feel like he doesn't give me the opportunity. \n\nApparently I'm a wuss and afraid of confrontation, so I left him a note on his door that said exactly the following: \"Please be considerate of your neighbors when coming home after 12am. Have a lot of early mornings. No hate, just would appreciate it. Thank you :)\" \n\nAnd yes, I did draw a smiley face lol. I really didn't want this to get ugly with someone I have to live next to. \n\nThen I popped some meditation music into some headphones.

At ME. \n\nI'm also not sure what he's talking about when he says that, I'm an extremely boring neighbor and don't even have people over because I live in a tiny studio apartment, lol. I try so hard to be undetectable. \n\nI actually thought I had left him the note after people had left as to not embarrass him, but it turns out there was still one person still left over.

Problems only started happening recently and mostly only because I have been thinking about breaking up. We never really had too much in common: we're both studying similar majors in uni (that's how I met her); we're from different backgrounds and cultures; and smaller insignificant things like she doesn't eat fruit at all and I love fruit, she doesn't exercise and I like to keep fit, she a chocolate connoisseur and I'm not a sweet tooth, different music and film tastes, etc. But we agreed that didn't matter too much since it didn't really affect how we felt towards each other.\n\nTo give some context, she used to be very into me and wanted to spent time together. Now it seems that only I'm initiating to make plans, meet up and talk, which we don't really do more than once a week. I understand a lot of this strain comes from uni now that the semester's commenced but I sort of feel forgotten and pretty dissatisfied in general that she's not really putting too much effort into the relationship. This feeling isn't based on any empirical evidence; she always tells me that she likes me and has always talked us out of it; but it is based on her attraction to me relative to the past.\n\nWe both agreed before uni began that we would see each other Friday evenings after class and occasionally have dinner out. First week was great spending time together, didn't have dinner. Second week was rough; I felt she was a little cold to me for some reason and I ended up trying to break things off again. She talked me out of it, I ended up reconsidering, opening up to her about how I felt and explained that she needed to improve her communication (not the first time she's told me and not the first time I've told her). We went out for dinner after. Now this is the third week. Last night (Thursday), she invited me to sleep over at her place (parents present) on Friday night. I said I was feeling under the weather and was probably better if I didn't. Come Friday I'm excited to finally spend some time with my gf after a busy week and she tells me that she's spending the evening with her sister. No notice, no apology for surprising me with her sudden plans (she did apologise for \"making me feel sad\" but that's not the point). I've been feeling disrespected like this for a while now.\n\nOf course this one event doesn't encapsulate the whole situation but I do feel like there's been this problem for a while now. I know she's feeling stressed in uni and that's probably what's taking the toll on her to justify her behaviour recently. I don't think it's due to any fault in her character but I feel like she doesn't understand me. I've tried to be honest to her about but it always feels like my words are falling on deaf ears. So I guess this is a bit of a cry for help: would I be an asshole if I were to end things like this now?",

We're both young and broke so we're trying to save money here and there and the house was only partially furnished. On the first meeting with the landlord, we agreed that he still needed to fix a couple things in the house in the near future (there was no interphone, no freezer in the fridge, no smoke detectors!!!, and no showerhead), and because of some legit reasons (we both have insomnia) we asked him to add another bed in the guest room. \n\nNote we asked \"We know it should be on us, but is there any chance you have a spare bed or mattress you could put in the guest room?\", and he said, sure no problem, we'll buy a cheapish one and give it to you for free. We thought we were very lucky and waited. A month passed and finally the landlord said he would come give us the bed on a certain day. At 9pm that day I called and asked if he was still going to come over and he replied that he changed his mind and he wouldn't buy us another bed. \n\nWell, it was rude not to tell us sooner, but it's kind of fair. So a couple days later he came over to talk about the other things he said he would fix and he said he would order the interphone and smoke detectors and then have his own electrician install them, but we had to wait a bit because he was also having his own house fixed. Sure, fine. He also said he would ask his own plumber advice on how to install a showerhead for a cheapish price (quote \"£10 and it should be good\").\n\nThen we asked about the freezer, he jumped and said (and it really sounded like a stupid excuse...) that the previous tenants stole the fridge that was originally in the kitchen and replaced it but he had no idea that it had no freezer and he agreed to buy one for us (I checked all fucking local appliances stores and even online and you can buy a small one for £70). \n\nDidn't hear from him for another week and I texted him if he had some news. He seemed pissed off and replied \"ordered the freezer\", so I asked when to expect him so that we could be home and he replied \"when it arrives\". \n\nPlease note that I have been extremely polite the entire time and that smoke detectors in the kitchen are mandatory in the UK. We also bought ourselves a lot more stuff that was missing, such as hoover, shelves, wifi hub, wardrobes etc\n\nIdk, are we the assholes for asking for a spare bed in the first place?

I also just remembered this sub while being confused andhope this is the right place. I don’t really am a frequent reddit user and made a new account just for this. So I don’t really know how all of this works but here I go.\n\nSo I am currently having quite a hard time with one group of friends from high school. It’s been around half a year now where from my perspective they started becoming more and more distant. Or rather me and my best friend at that time. The last time we did anything together was a week before Christmas and since then it especially went down the drain.\nI should probably add that both of us are kinda broken on the mental side which lead to us not really being able to react properly at that time making us grow apart quite a bit.\nIt ended with me becoming distant or excluded from the rest of this group of friends. They ignored me, wouldn’t talk to me and did stuff without me. \n\nThen in the beginning of this year my mind cleared up a bit. But they kept ignoring me. One day then I was told I was too negative und that that only dragged them down so they started to avoid me. And I can at that point only agree that I was still pretty negative and all.\nBut them ignoring me didn’t really make that better at all und made me grow more annoyed and confused which in tirn would make us grow even further apart.\n\nSo I decided to offer a full turn. I wouldn’t be negative and just stop doing so and they in turn wouldn’t ignore me. And then we did that.\nOr so I thought. I took extra notice on my behavior and all and didn’t really do anything they complained about (yes I’m certain about that. I even kept track and wrote that down for a bit).\nBut even though they agreed they didn’t do anything of the agreement. They stayed distant and kept treating me like air.\n\nAnd now a few days ago after I tried to initiate talking and all, which failedin both ways. When I talked about stuff I was interested in and that happened to me or just asked general questions I was really just talking to a wall. Now I tried going with something they ((ex)best friend) was interested in.\n\nAgain I need to say how I made these friends rather recently when one of them transferred to my school 1.5 years ago. And they also were the first proper friends (or so I would say) in highschool (we are close to finishing but my mind stopped me from being able to properly interact with others before them).\nAnd through my (ex)best friend. I opened up quite a bit and was able to start doing things I always wanted to do (join a theatre group, considering going to a dance school) but also stuff irrelevant to them (eg. school chorus).\n\nGoing back to the other thing I tried. After I tried talking about that topic and before that aswell in a way I now realize. \nThey accused me of copying them and that being the only reason I do those things (subjective interpretation of what they said). They also wrote that they would still be avoiding me because I would be so negative and annoyed which I have to admit, I started tobe again after they did nothing of their part while I kept pretending that it didn’t bother me to not be negative.\n\nSo AITA for reacting negatively and annoyed (I would be ... I don’t really know ... unfriendly I guess) after they ignored me for so long me being sad about it, reconciling afterwards but them not doing what they said they would. \nAnd especially now after they simply told me that they will avoid me even more after I didn’t just remain cold after all of that and also accusing me of just copying them and being to only reason I do the things I like.\n\nAm I in the wrong for reacting negative to this.\n\nI don’t remember what I am supposed to write at the end and I just hope I didn’t come to the wrong place cause I don’t know if this is appropriate for this sub nor if it violates the rules but I really don’t know.\n\nI also apologize for the outdrawn sentences I know they are/were annoying if you read this far.

Soon after arriving, I started dating my girlfriend, who I met through my roommate (friend of a friend).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is, our shared bathroom has gotten so filthy I try my best to avoid showering at home – I shower literally anywhere else: my girlfriend’s place, the gym, my friends’ places. After my roommate showers, there’s just a thick layer of slippery soap scum and long hair. I slipped and slided around in the tub for months before giving in and buying a shower scrubber. I’ve bought every cleaning product in an attempt to reduce the slipping risk in the bathtub. If I have to shower at home, I spend a good 5 mintues before each shower trying to get rid of the soap scum so I don't have to step in it. \n\nI’ve mentioned it to her a few times, pretty passively (“Hey, I’ve had some good success with X product for the tub, give it a shot!”) trying not to actively blame her for the scum, but there’s really only scum after she showers – it might be the coconut oil or something.

I ran into some difficult times in a housing situation, and C and his girlfriend K offered to rent me a room. C had been dating K for about a year, and I was good friends with K as well. I was weary about cohabitating with friends, but they practically begged me to do it. We set some ground rules, rent cost etc, and one rule being that they were 100% ok with me having  girls over or whatever, (tenant/landlord law in the state forbids landlords from preventing a tenant from having guests anyway.) \n\nFast forward a few months, I had to have knee surgery which put me off of work for 14 weeks. In this time I needed an incredible amount of help getting around ( I couldn't drive either) and the girl I was seeing was amazing at helping me. She would stay over on days when I had early morning doctor of PT appointments and help me whenever she could.\n The problem was, K did not like this girl. K is the kind of friend who thinks she knows what's best for you, so even though she had no discernable reason to hate her, she just did. One week this girl had to stay over about 4 nights in a row, to help me getting to appointments and we were also working on a large charity project for a children's hospital ( this was around the holidays)\nI should note that this girl didn't shower here, we didn't cook or eat their food, drink their drinks or hang out in common areas. I/We literally stayed in the room I rented the entire time. \nAbout a week later I get this text from K:\n\n\"Hey, I don't have a lot of friends, but the ones I do have, I value a lot in my life. Part of the reason I probably don t have a lot of friends is because I don't like to bullshit or be fake. If there's something bothering me, I like to talk about it and resolve it. I know you've told me you've had bad experiences with roommates and I have too, trust me, but I really did mean it when I said that we will never have an issue, because we are all good friends. \nI'm going to be upfront because I don't expect anything less from you. Get your dick wet...i love sex and I don't feel like you should be deprived. But can (girl) just come less? She's there every single day, and we didn't really sign up for 2 roommates. My sisters will be here from dec 23rd till January 11th, and unfortunately we only have two bathrooms, so could she also please not come when they are here? \"\n\nI responded \"ok\" but I was actually hurt a lot by this. \nLike.. being accused of trying to move this girl in, when she had no property here and didn't cost them anything was insulting. Also they know I can't walk or drive around due to my surgery, yet assume she's just staying over for sex. Not to mention I felt like if I rent a room somewhere, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. \nI couldn't argue the point because they're the ones helping me out with housing, and I didn't want to put my friend C in the middle of this, but I felt like this was only said because K hated this girl. I started looking for a new place to stay immediately but it took 6 weeks. In this 6 weeks neither K nor C, or her visiting sisters would even acknowledge my existence. No one would talk to me or even make eye contact with me. Not to mention my birthday was during the time her sisters were over which made it incredibly lonely sitting in my room like a ghost in the attic. \nI moved out and haven't spoken to K at all since. C contacted me later asking me to apologize to K for \"getting weird and ignoring her\" after she sent that text. The thing is, I couldn't do it. I didn't want to be her friend anymore. Unfortunately it also cost me my friendship with C. \nTLDR: I rented a room with my friend and his girlfriend. They agreed before hand they're cool with me having girls over. Had a girl over too often due to needing help with injury/Charity work. Friend's girlfriend hated this girl asked me to not have her come over so often/ anymore. I felt like if I rent a room, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. Both friendships with friend and his girlfriend are destroyed. AITA? ",

We've been through too much, and I'd definitely want more and want her to be with me. \n\nSo basically i turned down sex last night, cause she thought we'd bone and I'd be like \"wow I was just horny, let's be best friends\" \n\nTldr: \nTurned down sex with my ex, because i don't believe i could do that, or be close to her without having feelings for her.

I think it's preposterous that servers, drivers, or members of any profession should be paid less than minimum wage with the assumption that tips will make up the difference. That being said, I accept that the system is not going to change anytime soon, and so I make sure to tip decently when I visit restaurants. (Never less than 15% unless the server was actively rude, 20% as a baseline for slightly above average service). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, when I order delivery, in addition to an expected tip, there is a flat delivery charge (usually $2) that is explicitly NOT a tip to the drivers. Because of this, I have developed a system where, when I do order out by myself, I usually order a few meals, eat one immediately, and have the others as leftovers. In this case, I tip 20% of what one meal would have cost, on top of the standard delivery fee. This dilutes the fee and the tip over several meals, making the price of delivery worth it for me. The amount of work that the driver does is unchanged from 1-3 meals, so I feel that tipping the same amount is justified. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis leads to a second discussion. I brought up my habits at a party last night, and got mixed responses. One friend, who had been a delivery driver in the past, claimed that this was unacceptable. He told me that his wages were only $4/hr, that his only other income was tips, and that even with 20% tips he would often not make minimum wage. I agreed with him that the system was flawed, and told him that everyone in his position should simply find another job. If enough drivers don't keep their position due to the unfair system, wages will increase. (He had already done this, moving from food delivery to another, standard salary job). In areas of poverty, I understand that sometimes, you take what you can get, but this is a middle class neighborhood with plenty of jobs available that do not require any significant level of education. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for (1) ordering more food for takeout but tipping the same, and/or (2) believing that workers should protest a crappy system by changing jobs?

Five months ago, I was dealing with constant jaw pain and numbness in parts of my face. After seeing doctors and dentists, I finally landed at an oral surgeon’s office who took an X-ray and found my wisdom teeth were technically impacted but actively growing at the wrong angle. The reason I was experiencing numbness is because the my teeth are pressing down on a nerve, and surgery will be necessary to prevent possible permanent damage. I scheduled my surgery to land specifically on spring break for my school. Pretty much all of my professors this semester take off points for missing class, so missing an entire week was entirely out of the question for something I’m paying $21K for. This was in December.\n\nI asked my boyfriend immediately afterwards if he would be able to watch me for my surgery. He’s ending trade school so we planned ahead to make sure he would be free during the time I went for my surgery. Everything fit perfectly and we confirmed this was the plan. \n\nThis all changed about three weeks ago, when he got a call from a possible employer who was demanding that he start training on the same day of my surgery. My boyfriend asked if he could delay until the day after and explained the situation, but the employer basically brushed him off and said “she knows it’s a job right?” \n\nThat annoyed me immensely, seeing as this surgery is necessary and I’m not allowed to be by myself, but whatever. We had a heated discussion about it and I told him that if he can’t do it to let me know NOW so I can arrange a “baby sitter” as soon as possible. He kinda went back and forth on it and then decided that he doesn’t want to work with this specific company and that he’ll bring me for my surgery. Okay, cool, I can relax. \n\nToday(less than a week before my surgery), he tells me he can’t take me to my surgery. We get into a huge argument and he says he wants to go to the interview so that it can be on his resume for future employers to look at it. I’m pissed because I can’t find anybody to take me, everyone I know is busy. The paperwork specifically says I’m not allowed to leave the center by myself because I’ll be under the influence; someone has to check me out, so I can’t even get an Uber. He says I should consider his employment, but I don’t think any future employer is going to care that he got a job interview and trained for one day then quit. In fact, I think this shows a lack of commitment. \n\nI feel super guilty because I don’t want to say he can’t go to his interview but now I have to ask a friend to take the day off last minute.

Long story short, even though she's not my cup of tea while sober, blackout me was more than willing to go home with her and be college kids for the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy awkward and hungover ass couldn't figure out a tactful way to dip out the next morning so we continued to wake up at noon, start drinking again, and make me question my standards again. After sobering up and getting home on Sunday, the two of us came to an agreement that young adults like to fuck around wile drunk, and that's the end of it. Trouble is she kept contacting me, assertively at first, but eventually easing off well after I told her we're done and I had started a serious relationship with a girl I actually liked. \n\nFast forward about a year and a half and I had tried to maintain a platonic communication with her despite her best efforts. I know the easiest thing would be to just block her #/Snapchat, but mixed in with untasteful nudes and drunken pleas to come over see and her were seriously concerning messages about depression and mental instability. Call it my fault or call it bad luck, but either way I seem to have a history of getting overly involved romantically with depressed, anxiety ridden, and/or bipolar women. I want to break any ties with her, but at the same time don't wanna be the trigger that sets off someone who's already claimed to be suicidal. \n\nIn case it wasn't already obvious, I'm not exactly a pillar of emotional stability either, and I've made the mistake of digging myself a deeper hole. Due to a mixture of post break-up loneliness, depression, and alcoholism, I've let my sad dick take control of my brain and slept with her. I'm not even attracted to her, and the fact that I'm too ashamed to confide in my friends about this situation is telling, but I just find myself caving in out of shear boredom almost. I think she's even catching on to the fact that I prefer not to have her around my place while others are over, and only see her when I'm feeling down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: Girl I had a one night stand with but carry little interest in still contacts me.

That upset him a lot, he yelled at me and said I was just criticising all his hard work without letting him take me through it, and that i have no empathy for him.\n\nToday we were talking about it again and he said ‘I’ve compromised so much on this trip for you. If it were up to me we wouldn’t even bother doing the US. Because of this, I now can only be in Canada for a week.’ Well this was news to me because he had never said that, I had no idea! I told him he never mentioned that and that he really should go to Canada because he’s been wanting to go since he was 15 and it was important to him so important to me, I don’t want him doing the trip to the US for me if it means he misses out on something. And he blew up at me, he said ‘no I want to do this, I just want you to recognise how I’m giving up and compromising so much to do this with you.’ \n\nI feel like I’m being a wretched person for not being more thankful my husband wants to spend time with me, as I would have thought that’s a given if he’s choosing to do it? If not he can absolutely go to Canada if he feels like he’s giving up so much. AITA?",

Being together during her time back here was great until she reveals that she's \"kinda sorta\" seeing someone at her new uni. Technically she didn't do anything wrong because we weren't together but I still feel a bit betrayed she kept this from me. \n\nNYE passes and she goes back to school. Her thing with her new boy grows more serious and my feelings of jealousy and resentment grow. I realize maintaining any relationship with her is causing me more pain than happiness and tell her that I need a clean break.\n\nShe doesn't take the news very well and says she loves me and needs me in her life as her best friend. In turn, I reply that I don't know how to be \"just friends\" with her and she's only been causing me pain lately. The fight escalates until I decide to go cold turkey and stop responding. \n\nIt's been a week and since then she's sent me messages about how she loves me and values me as one of her best friends, and also messages about how I'm being selfish and can't make this decision for both of us. I haven't responded, but I feel like crap.\n\nNote: according to another friend of mine, she's using me for validation and attention although I don't think she's malicious like that.",

TL:DR at bottom\n\nI am late 20's and have just moved back in with my parents to save for a house. I've got a pretty low paid job, but should be able to save up enough in a year, maybe year and a half. Anyway, I am struggling to adapt to living back home with my parents as it is. I moved out over 10 years ago to go to uni, get a job get on with life etc. I moved away from my home town 10  years ago so moving home back has been strange. However, I have great friends from school who I'm still close with, but unfortunately don't see as much as I like, (no-ones fault, most are just married/kids/busy lives) so I spend quite a bit of time at home.\n\nGrowing up there were/are no major issues. They are essentially good people no abuse or anything like that. I do have some issues regarding privacy though, for example before going away on holiday as a teenager my dad once went through my luggage (can't remember why, just that it led to an argument.). Also they do slightly irritating things like knocking on the bathroom door when I'm in the shower/toilet telling me they've made me a cup of tea.\n\nI have on several occasions asked my parents, mainly dad to please ask before using my things. For example my car (which I bought, pay insurance for etc). This morning I woke up/came downstairs about 9:30 to dad walking in the the door explaining he took my car to get my radio fixed at a local store. I was literally planning on doing this today, and was using it as a reason for me to get dressed/ready so I could go into town and carry out some other tasks. But it just threw my whole day off and I lost all motivation to even get dressed (I'm also diagnosed with depression, so I try and set myself tasks to help me get up at the weekend). He noticed my mood was off, and asked what was the matter and I explained how it makes me feel as if my opinions don't matter if anything I say seems to be ignored.\n\nGo to this evening, dad comes in and said a neighbour is just borrowing my jump leads (which I keep in my car). Note, he's not asking IF someone can borrow them. Just that they ARE. I mean the answer would obviously be yes, if he'd asked, but he didn't. And considering the conversation we had literally earlier today I just loose all fight and don't see any point in bringing it up anymore. I have had the same conversation both parents so many times before.\n\nMy question is I am the asshole for getting irritated at my dad for taking my car and other things even when it's sometimes to do something useful (like fix the radio) when I have explicitly asked him not too several times?\n\nI think I am a bit sensitive about my car as well (it's not new or anything) because it's the only thing outside of the house that I can really call mine. And I love driving it to work.\n\n\nDL:DR I am the asshole for over reacting when my dad helps me out and takes my car without asking me first.",

They really both cared for each other. Then, she started to ignore him in every other class but lunch. Okay weird but... Then the event happened, It was a normal Friday I gotten home and started playing video games, then Derrick called the group chat crying, Karen had messaged him that she wanted to break up, since she liked Maddie (Maddie was a jerk too Derrick mind you,) My friend Hellen, couldn't handle this so she left the call, leaving me to comfort him. Derrick is a nice kid, he kept saying it wasn't Karen's fault for breaking up with him, that it was his!\n\nNow present day Derrick still kinda of has a crush on her. She caused him problems. But, funny thing is, this wasn't caused by the breakup. This happened months after it. But he continued to be friends with her, which, I am guessing may have caused this. Why? Because relationships with your ex can be terrible! He still has a crush on her, since he has every class with her and sits right next to her. Imagine seeing someone you were so close to having a relationship with dating someone else, or just being stuck in a friend zone with someone you love..\n\nSo Reddit WIBTA for suggesting my friend that it might be better for him to stop being friends with his ex?

The last straw for me was finding out that during that month he'd begun relentlessly flirting with other girls on social media, whether they were interested or not, and was taking another girl on dates near identical to our first dates, all while burying any posts of me under his woodworking and not telling any of them I existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, as for why I wrote it all out; any other time we'd fought, he would yell and throw things I'd end up so exhausted from the flashbacks and panic it caused, he'd have a panic attack and I'd drop everything to take care of him even though he never stopped yelling or physically intimidating things, and I'd give up. The next day he'd promise he'd try to do better, and make me laugh and smile even though nothing had been solved. I didn't want to give in without having fixed anything this time so I wrote out the points I wanted to make on my phone and read them off my phone. I wanted him to realize everything that he'd done.

I wouldn’t say I have a “line” to be crossed, so to speak, on any of the jokes made. Until I found out I did. A mutual friend that had been added to the group recently, one who it wouldn’t bother me in the slightest if I never heard from again, decided a few months ago it would be funny to send some footage of what could be described as a hostage situation with a drug cartel I’m assuming. They had a man tied up with a bag over his head and they were slicing into his torso with a knife. I’m talking like you can see the fat under his skin type slicing. Since this is Snapchat the video plays automatically when you open it so I had no choice whether I saw it or not. I’ll never get that image out of my head, this man was being tortured. So I pretty much said that if this is what the group chat was going to turn in to then they should let me know so I can leave, I would’ve preferred to have not seen that. It was met with some pretty heavy backlash, things like “you’re being a baby” “you have a weak stomach” things like that. I got in a big argument with everyone, it seemed *insane* to me that I was the one being looked at like an asshole and weak for saying I would leave the group over that and didn’t want to see it. My friends like to act like nothing bothers them or grosses them out (maybe it’s true, I don’t know), I don’t think they’re bad people. Whatever. It blew over, haven’t had anything like that since. Fast forward to yesterday and they were talking about some gross skin related stuff, which is more tame, but I still think is gross. A reasonable thing to find disgusting I think. So I literally just sent a picture of a grossed out face in response and it blew up again “what are you gonna leave the group? Does your tummy hurt?”. I explained that it’s not the same thing and we got in an argument that eventually ended. This all happened early in the morning, so when the member who sent the torture video before read the argument he sent the video **again** just to be an asshole. I acted like it didn’t bother me this time because I had already seen it, but I thought that was so disrespectful. Everyone else is acting like I’m the asshole for making a big deal out of not wanting to see things like that, but I think any normal person wouldn’t want to see videos like that.

Although we talked theoretically about visiting, my friend and I never actually made any plans. Then, out of the blue, she sent me screenshots of tickets out to my city! \nTurns out, she was planning on staying for a whole entire week. However, she didn’t consult me on this at all and already told her parents that she’d be staying with me (I live with my big family, it’s really difficult to accommodate somebody since there’s already so many of us). So here I am, already trying to plan an out of state move, and now I have to entertain her. She insists on certain experiences that I just CAN’T afford right now (and I told her that). On top of that, after going out and spending money on one of those said experiences (in which my new meds fucked me up and I felt sick but she wanted to keep adventuring), I was absolutely exhausted and wanted nothing more that to relax in my own bed and play my own games. But when I said this, she flat out told me that I COULDN’T play because she was going to play instead. Also, I went out for a bit to gather some stuff from storage and she went through all the stuff in my room and decided what of my stuff to keep and what to toss/give away (I did not ask her to do this). She even tossed some of my tax documents. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy I got to meet her and we did have fun times, but this is also seriously stressing me out because I really wanted to spend this time organizing, packing, and spending time with my family. I had no idea she’d be coming until it was too late. So here I am, trying to decompress so I can talk to her about it. But AITA for being a bit frustrated about all this? \nTLDR; an internet friend came to visit without consulting me but I’m short on money and in the middle of trying to move. She insists on expensive, time consuming tourist experiences while I just want to spend time saying goodbye to my family and friends. She doesn’t respect my personal space.

She's relying on these scores to get into med school, which she considers the only option as far as her future goes. She has been studying day and night for these exams for months, and while she's rightfully nervous, some of the stuff she's been saying is just rubbing me the wrong way. She took the first test yesterday, her math exam, and has been crying ever since she got home from it, saying she's going to feel guilty for the rest of her life. Due to her own calculations, she got a 95% on this test, giving herself some room for error she's settling with a 91%. she hasn't received any results and I'm not sure how she determined this on her own just from taking it and analyzing how hard it was but she says shes positive shes in the lower A range and its tearing her apart. Now I know cultural differences are a factor in this, as I'm from the US and probably the laziest/most laid back part of it at that, beachside in Florida. Also, probably more prominent is family differences, a lot of pressure is put on her from her parents, and her mom projects on her, telling her how much she still regrets the scores she got on those tests. I know it's probably coming from my own insecurity as I was a teenage runaway and never finished high school, dropping out at age 17 and doing random odd jobs/freelancing for a living, which I am still doing. It just gets under my skin a bit when she got an A on her math final and is hysterical about it not being an A+, saying her entire life could possibly be ruined. Now, I've not said a word about this bothering me, and I dont intend to, ive been giving her the greatest support I can, but I feel a little guilty for mentally undermining her struggles.

She uses photos from a few years ago when she weighed less; 50-70 lbs.  less. first I asked questions: why? B/c she wants to “lose the weight before meeting” the person knowing that’s the version of herself she wants to be. How long do you talk to a potential date? MONTHS. How does that make you feel? How do you think it will make the other party feel? \n\nNext I did some research...ok I binged that catfish show and lurked on reddit...\n\nThe next time it came up I shared how negatively catfishing affects peoples’ lives. She was so dismissive to that (cuz she thinks she can get away with it ?) \n\nThen she made plans to meet this guy. I told her to at least do a video chat first. So did another close friend that is in the know. But the catfish gets so shady whenever we talk about the situation. I couldn’t get a straight answer but it seems like she did do a video chat and got rejected. Last time I asked how things were going she said she didn’t know if they were still meeting.

I blew her off and was rude about it saying I would be over in a minute (we r neighbors basically) but never showed up.

I set down my phone and waited till the morning. 7 am I send a block text clearly stating that what she is doing is 100% catfishing and it is wrong and not healthy. She is beautiful, really doesn’t even need to do this to herself. \n\nDid I draw a line in the sand that didn’t need to be there though? Is it a friend’s role to help patrol this kind of social behavior? She hasn’t contacted me since I sent the text yesterday. I’m pretty sure she is giving me the silent treatment.

I'm in the industry I want to be in and have learned a LOT, but I'm feeling more and more depressed being here and I don't deserve to be treated the way I am. I'm a hard worker, I'm punctual and I'm a team player.\n\nSo I contacted my old boss and asked if they'd have me back. It was an emphatic yes. The pay is the same, but I was treated so much better and had a lot more flexibility. If I go back I know I'll feel like a valuable asset to the company. \n\nIm still just trying to help myself be okay with leaving my \"dream job\". And I'm terrified to tell management at my current job that I'm going to be leaving. I'm scared that if I tell them I'm leaving they'll just fire me. (Which is a problem because I'm buying product from them to do a wedding for a client at the end of the month) \n\nAm I an asshole if I don't give them 2 weeks notice? (I live in a right to work state so I'm not required by law to give them any notice) \n\nMy hopefull projected timeline would be to give them 1-2 days notice. I dont want any drama or hubbub around my leaving. There is someone who can cover my position when i leave. My biggest concern around leaving is that they'll try and fire me or it will turn into a nasty confrontation and I wont be able to fill that wedding order. \n\nTLDR: I hate my current job so much and I'm going back to my old one but I'm afraid if I give 2 weeks notice my current job will fire me or treat me worse and won't let me buy the flowers I pre-booked for a client wedding.  AITA if I only give 1-2 days notice for me leaving?",

The other day a middle aged woman “Karen” who works across a couple locations came in while I was reviewing resumes. \n\nI was reading two resumes with another employee and they were just awful. Resume 1 listed their birth date while subsequently leaving off their education. In my country it’s illegal to ask the applicants age, only if they are over 18. They were 22. The resume did not list any skills they had picked up at their previous two part time jobs nor the dates that they worked there. It was half a page in normal size font that they increased to take up a whole page. They did not have a drivers license which is a requirement for the position and did not have any cover letter. \n\nResume 2 was 3 pages. They had one part time job, again not listing any acquired skills. They had their education as the last segment on their resume. They filled 2.5 pages with volunteer experience leaving off any dates or skills acquired though these experiences. Most volunteering was 2 hour projects. Their contact information was only located on the second page of their resume and they only had their name on the first page. Their font and size were not consistent across the document. Again, no cover letter. \n\nAnyway, Karen comes in while I’m lamenting on how bad these resumes are and how I dread we’ll never find someone qualified enough to fill our basic entry level sales associate position. Karen has marital issues that the staff is well aware of because she literally never shuts up about them. I can tell you about her financial troubles, her kids, her husband and her *gag* sex life (which I NEVER asked about. Super funny though because she tells everyone about her husbands ED and how he can’t hold a job because of it??). \n\nKaren starts tearing me a new one in that mom way for “harassing strong young men for their *likely* (obviously unknown because we can’t ask) mental disability”. I interviewed both of these candidates anyway because were so desperate for a hire. I understand not all mental deficits present but they both seemed normal, just lazy. I explained to Karen that it takes nothing for someone to google “how to write a resume” and even just follow the first google example, but she still says I was being mean and abusing my power. \n\nCome to find out she has been telling the other locations she works at how I’m a horrible manager and no wonder no one will work for me. She has taken each of my employees to the side and asked them how they feel about me. They told me that Karen made them feel very uncomfortable by doing this and that they have no issues with me. \n\nTLDR: older female coworker says I’m being unfair by criticizing resumes.

When she visited my apartment for the first time (2 years before I moved in with them) the first thing she did (after hugging me and saying Hi) was went straight to the cupboards and said \"Oh my god, you have real food!!\". I was 30 years old for fucks sake.

Once I disagreed with something and she broke down crying because I thought she was a horrible mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough..... I wouldnt say she is a horrible mother, there's a lot she isnt doing right, in my opinion. Her kids (now 11 and 13) are lazy and out of control.

He will step in when a MAJOR attitude correction needs to take place (like when the oldest punched a girl in school).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am done with feeling like less of a person just to help them out.

I wasn't raised with my sister, we grew up in separate foster homes so we aren't super close. I was surprised she invited me to live with her especially after I raised concerns about me living with kids. I'm diagnosed as bipolar II and I was worried about my mental stability around children. She said her kids are usually busy she has a large house and no one would bother me and she really wanted me to come.  This was slightly before Xmas and she invited our mom to stay with her for the holidays. I haven't talked  to our mother in over 5 years because her new husband used to secretly film me in the bathroom when I was a child. I told my mother about this before I left for college and showed her the grocery bag full of DVDs he made and she wasn't surprised because she knew had a sex addiction (I had no clue about). I stopped talking to her because she wanted me to thank this man for money they were sending me during college I refused and told them don't send me shit anymore. I dropped out of school beginning of sophomore year shortly after being diagnosed as bipolar and have been supporting myself ever since. \n\nI had no issue with our mom coming by for the holidays but I did not want to be there. My sister said our mom would only be there a day or so and I could hide in my room but I decided to go visit my boyfriend until the new year. I could tell this upset my sister but I got every one small gifts for the holidays so they knew I was thinking of them but I needed to take care of me. I return and everyone including the kids are being super cold to me. I would be starting CNA school soon so I just hid away in my room. I came back on Tuesday and school started the following Monday.  My classes are 6:30am - 3pm with a minimum 2hr bus ride sometimes 4hours for off site clinical hours so I'm away most of the day and I study at night. I start to sense the house being annoyed that I'm not spending time with them but honestly I'm busy and exhausted and have poor social skills. So I withdraw more and they start to slam doors and play music loud to make their presence known and I get anxious and stay in my room. I stop eating I stop going out to the kitchen. I stop drinking water so I don't have to leave to pee. They get louder outside the door so I just put in head phones and try to tune out hidden meanings in songs they play and words they say.  Also my sister confessed to me that her husband was nasty to her while she was pregnant with his child which makes me not trusting of him at all. And I'm still studying and waking up early. I truly am busy but I don't know what to say to anyone and I feel like my movements are being tracked so I stay even more silent and secluded.

Even more so after he began living with his partner and her 2 children. This is evident when, at the beginning of this year, I find out via Facebook photos that he came back to the country and married his current wife without letting either myself or my brother know (we are now 17 and 26) despite him also taking the time to visit my brother afterwards. \n\nIn any case, we come to last month where I discover (once again, via Facebook photos) that my dad and his wife have welcomed a child into the world.

It's the first one we have been able to spend together, as our first anniversary occured when we were in a LDR.\n\n On the day itself we didn't properly celebrate as he had classes 9-6pm, but he skipped his sports practice in the evening to spend some more time with me, which I was really happy with.\n\nWe had agreed several weeks previously to celebrate on Wednesday, because then he had a full free day to spend with me. But then the evening before he told me he had plans (study plans, so I wasn't really annoyed, just a little saddened) and we could meet up after 4.30pm. \n\nWe live together, so on the Wednesday I decided to wake him up by making him his favourite breakfast (pancakes) and I gave him a card and a small gift- a book he'd been talking about getting for ages. (I don't have a lot of money, my boyfriend is much more well off than me) I also got him roses. \n\nHe was really grateful, but he hadn't got me anything, or done anything special. He said it didn't occur to him to do anything. However, he said seeing as I had put in effort, that he would pay for dinner for both of us, and an activity (VR gaming centre in our town)- both of which we had originally planned upon a few weeks ago. I was really happy, because he knows I don't have a lot of money, so it really helps. I expressed how grateful I was.\n\nHowever, I kind of wanted a card, with a nice message. Obviously I didn't expect a gift after he told me he was willing to pay for the evening, because that was so generous of him. But I kind of wanted something to commemorate the anniversary with that I could keep later to look back on fondly. Sometimes he treats me anyway on non special occasions because he is so well off. (I'm very lucky)  So, I thought a card would make it more \"anniversary\" like.  I also just like the whole romantic messages in it too, haha.\n\nAt the time, because I didn't feel that a card was asking a lot financially or effort/timewise, I asked him if when he came back at 4.30pm he could try and bring me a happy anniversary card. He seemed fine with it, and he brought back a really nice card. I was delighted.\nJ\nBut it's been nagging on my mind today- this guy is normally so thoughtful and generous with his time, and he helps me out financially a lot. Was it selfish to demand extra on top of everything and ask him for a card? Does it come across as me being ungrateful and wanting more and more? What do you think?\n\n",

I want to make sure you obtain all the information:\n\nI met this person (call him TOM)on my 22nd birthday, I was drunk and with the help of liquid courage I managed to go up to TOM and ask for his number. The next day I he messaged me to save his number for the next time I go out. I was shocked that it worked lol \\[TOM also messaged me saying he would do ‘dirty things’ to me, I figured TOM liked me (probably a red flag here if he was willing to do things like that on such a short period of time…)\\] Regardless.\n\nStarting out as friends, we would meet up when we both had off which was the weekends only. Things were cool for several months. Time passes, I remember I did the whole “what are we?” and he kind of froze. I remember getting upset and that was a red flag there, but this was my first time with someone (I thought I was going to fast with it) so I ignored it. Carried on our relationship, we went out here and there, I guess you could say we were dating (I thought we were, and I assumed that). His birthday came, I gave a few cool gifts and what not. Then the holidays, Thanksgiving and then Christmas I did the same. At this point, he introduced me to his friends that were nice to me. So, in return, I tried to be as nice as possible and befriend them because my thinking is if you wanted to date someone you need to be cool with their friends &amp; fam. Everything was cool until\n\nChristmas Break//New Year’s\n\n\\*Remember this whole time I’m going to college and this was my first time ever to be on my own (away from home). During my Christmas break I decided to stay at my place so I was alone and my work is seasonal so I was literally doing nothing. \n\n\\-----&gt;  New Years. New Year seem to be a problem. Last year, I was with my parents (they’re in late 70s)  they went to bed at 7pm! So I didn’t want to go home to celebrate my new year like that. Comes the evening I get a random message from TOM’s friend asking me to go out with them for the New Year. I got excited cause I wasn’t doing anything. Excited to go, I got dressed and geared up to let loose &amp; experience the new year the right way! Then I get a message from TOM saying are you going out with my friends?! ( I should have messaged him about it before saying yes to TOM’s friend, turns out he had to work on New Years) I said yes to going because I got excited. He was really upset and said fine go. \n\nThe next day we talked, he thought it was wrong of me to go with his friends while he wasn’t there \\[ I can understand that \\]. I told him I wouldn’t do it again, things were weird after that, it wasn’t the same. We barely saw each other and talked, it was on and off. I get a message from the same friend that invited me out for NY to go for some food &amp; a show. I decided to go to surprise TOM since he worked later in the day. I went and it was just her, I kind of panicked and didn’t want to be rude and just leave because of what TOM and I agreed on so I went with it. TOM’s friend and I talked about life it was pretty chill, his friend was cool af. He found out, I tried to explain that I was trying to surprise TOM by just showing up unexpectedly. This backfired, things were never the same. We didn’t talk for a while until my birthday. I tried to invite him out to celebrate it but he didn’t show. 3 days later he showed up gave me a gift wished me a happy birthday and left. It was strange, like he felt like he had to do it (return a favor). Time flies and things kinda settle down. **TOM wanted to be friends rather than anything else (via tinder msg)**. I haven’t seen TOM for a while until he asked me to go out with him and his friends. I went, he was drunk and admittedly said things went too fast that’s what scared him. I wasn’t buying it because we “talked” for a whole year and he didn’t know what I was majoring in? What my hobbies were? and I’m sure a lot more. But I know all this information about TOM, it’s just salt in the wounds at this point. I TOLD HIM THAT I HATED HIM FOR NOT CARING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT NIGHT. TOM said that he would “always be nice to me”. Lol, anyway So I’m not interested in TOM anymore, I was done trying to pursue him. \n\nOne night this summer one of his friends \\*AT THE TIME\\* invited me out to a hot tub party, I went and after that  I got message from his friend saying that he was deleted from all social medias from TOM and was sent a message saying “why would you try to get with my ex”. I was confused. I laughed about it and his friend did too, I moved on. Over time TOM tried to talk to me on social media, I was dry and ignored it.\n\nThen comes this decemeber: my friend wanted me to go out to the club were I met TOM, of course he was there and so was his friends. I’m not interested in TOM but his friends greeted me we took pictures I kissed his friend on the cheek as a good bye. That night I got a message saying why did I kissed his friend. I sent “LMAO” and that was it. Then a week later I was sent a message to go out with a few friends that were gonna be with TOM. This is New Year weekend, so I had nothing like last year and I went to have a few drinks. Cops were out so I stood around till the bar closed. Tom and his friends were done with clubbing and were waiting on a ride. I offered to get an UBER to be nice and to make sure everyone arrives safely to their destinations. Uber X carries on 4 I totally spaced on that and there was 5 of us. So in the end we tried to pack in the car and the uber driver was like this can’t happen so I jump out and said  I’ll just go home ( I didn’t live to far from the club and wasn’t too drunk) I got out and the car started to drive off and then out of no where one of TOM’s friend jumped out and thought it was messed up for me to get an uber for everyone and not even take it. Tom and the people made it back to their destination. Out of no-where me and the friend that rode with me back to the same destination gets deleted from TOM’s social media. I don’t care, I ended up blocking him in return. His friend was like what did I do? I apologized for bring him in this mess even though I was just trying to be nice and be cautious about going home. Apparently, TOM was mad, stormed off as soon as they are arrived.\n\nAt this time his friends told me the truth (since he was gone) and everything that was wrong with me and him. I found out that TOM’s friends are not trustworthy, they tend to “mess around” with a lot people. I think I can say that TOM has insecurities because he thought I slept with his friends in the past. Tom’s friends said I was too nice and tried to please TOM no matter what. Also, Tom’s friends told him to take me seriously. Tom’s friends said I was too honest which made things worse at times. \n\nThere was a reason why I wanted to wait till I was older to try to date and to experience things with someone I cared about. To show what type of person I am I had my first kiss when I was 18 and didn’t get laid till well this relationship.\n\nIt’s just sad that I tried so hard to make this perfect.\n\nI know this was a lot, but I wanted to provide my thinking to each action I did. It was my first person I thought I loved. Hard lesson learned. As well I learned that age is just a number because TOM was immature for a 28yo. Lol, I tried to make this relationship happen and it damaged me pretty bad tbh… through school, work, and my own life probs.\n\nI figured I was in the wrong because I got unfriended and what not…\n\nso AITA to ruin this relationship, take friends, idk?\n\nwhat do you think??",

I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature.

While we were together, his dad worked nights and I worked days as neither of us wanted to put our son in daycare and wanted to be around him as much as possible. It worked out well for us. \nNow we split custody 50/50.

My ex and I have similar incomes so neither of us pay child support, though he recently got a new job and makes significantly more than I do, I believe. \n\nAnyway, him and his girlfriend are pushing for our son to be in preschool, which I agree would be good for him. \nHowever, I’m doing this by myself while working full time and going to school full time.

We’re in high school, and have been considered Best Friends™️ for the entire time we’ve known each other. This year, however, was different. \n\nNot only did she begin to literally ignore my existence, she would get mad at me when I was in a bad mood. I’ll admit, I get snappy when I’m angry or sad, but from knowing me all this time she knew that none of it was directed at her. Regardless, when I’d snap at her and immediately apologise, she didn’t care and would storm off. She started doing drugs and fucking around with her boyfriend constantly,  and it got to the point where she didn’t care about anything else. Kate’s life was entirely drugs and sex and rock n’ roll. Once she said “if I don’t have my Juul I’m gonna have a sucky day,” and snapped at me that she “NEEDS her Juul to be happy,” to which I replied “that’s not good, Kate that means you’re getting addicted to nicotine. Fucking stop” and then ALL OF HER NEW FRIENDS ganged up on me, saying it was obvious I’d never Juuled before and making me feel terrible about myself. \n\nThrough those _Extracurricular Activities_ she became friends with a bunch of people I didn’t have anything in common with. I’d still go sit with her and made an effort, even though I felt uncomfortable the entire time. It came to the point where she began to ignore me completely, like I said earlier. I’d say “hey Kate I’m going to class now,” and she wouldn’t even acknowledge I was there. So I left. Then I stopped saying anything at all. \n\nI started hanging out with my other friends, and I stopped talking to Kate all the time. People would always ask me why I was friends with her if she made me feel so awful. I never knew how to answer. \n\nHer boyfriend, another friend, and I all planned for months a surprise birthday party for Kate, which—minus a few minor bumps in plans— went well. There was cake, presents, and all the typical bday things. We did it because her mom is a bitch and never let her have a birthday party before. However, when we were out doing the thing we planned, she did nothing but complain and snap at people and sit in the corner whispering with her boyfriend. \n\nWe were also in a club together. It was Debate Club, and you had to pay dues to be in it. We were presenting a bill to be debated—one that I did literally all the work for— and her only job was to do the opening speech. That was it, a minute long synopsis of our bill. So I’m walking to the room Debate Club is in, I can see the door a few feet ahead of me, and I get a phone call from Kate saying she doesn’t have her club dues. “Should I go? I don’t think I should go.” Finally, even though I was going to do horribly without her, I said she shouldn’t come. I was just so done with how unreliable she was. She said thanks and hung up while I was mid-sentence. So I went in, tried to give the opening speech completely unprepared, and I did horribly (as expected). It was the worst public speech I’d ever given, which sucked because I’m normally extremely good at that. I burst into tears on stage and ran off. I literally couldn’t do it anymore. Two days later, I hear she’s talking shit about me behind my back, telling people (MY FRIENDS) that I told her to “get the hell out of Debate” and calling her an “unreliable bitch” and all that jazz. \n\nSo I texted her. “How dare you. How fucking dare you do all this shit  to me. You’ve been so mean and made me feel so mad about myself when all I’ve done is care about you.” And in the texts, I did say things that I don’t regret but we’re pretty damn mean— “all you do is smoke, fuck, and feel bad for yourself” “you step on other people’s balls to make yours feel bigger” “manipulative” “unreliable” etc. Then I blocked her number and that was that. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

Kinda a long post so here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's sort of a lot of background to get through, I guess, for it to make a little more sense. My mum is a single-mother. Dad walked out when I was young, the typical story.  Basically, in my hometown, the only members of my family are me, my mum (who I'll call M) and my step-grandad (I'll label G here.) M's been obsessively protective of me throughout my entire life -- she basically cut herself off from anyone who wasn't me, and frequently told me things like how she doesn't \"**need any friends**\" because she \"**has me**\" and how I'm all she needed. I'm entirely aware of how unhealthy that is, don't worry. Throughout most of my teen years I frequently encouraged her to get out more and form actual connections that weren't me or her family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I eventually (clearly not what M wanted) moved three hours out of my hometown to go to university, and well, she took it with a mixed bag. But I thought she was coping well. Then recently, on call with her, she mentions how she's found a potential new job; and it's a job she's really been wanting to get for a while now. At first I'm happy for her -- but then she mentions it's way outside of my hometown. Immediately, my thoughts go to *G*\\- he has literally no one else in the town. The rest of our family don't bother contacting him (since he's only a step-relation, ties were cut after my Grandma died) and he's at that life stage where a lot of his friends are gone. M's about the only person he has left that still visits outside of nurses and such.  He's provided for and helped us for so long, the thought of him ending up alone is just, well, awful for me. He's well into late 80s, and his health isn't exactly well. My worry is if something happens and he just has no one around him to help. Or even anyone to talk to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM seemed surprised, and I think that she'd forgotten to even consider him, but she got angry at me for not supporting her after so long of telling her she needed to get out more and be ambitious. She pointed out that, well, she's not his caretaker or anything, so she doesn't have to stay and look after him. She also rightly brought up that *I* left without much debate about leaving him, so it's hypocritical of me. I'm less sure of that since well... I left thinking that she'd be there. Getting to the point, we got in a massive argument over it, where I brought up that she wasn't really considering anyone other than herself and that she had other things to consider before making a big move like that.  \n\nThis is without mentioning that said job would also be way closer to where my Uni is, so she'd effectively be moving to me. This didn't slip my attention either.\n\nWe fought, we called each other selfish, it was a bit of a yelling match over the phone and we haven't spoken a lot since. She did, however, tell the rest of the family who've contacted me trying to explain her side. \n\nThis includes G, who says that he just wants M to be happy. Which is what I expected from him, really. But it doesn't make me any less worried about him being left behind in his last years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I'm just worrying -- because I'm starting to see it from her point of view. For years I've gone on to her about pursuing what she wants to do, but when she turns around and says she's going to, I've essentially said \"no not like that\". I just really don't like the idea of my grandad being alone but I'm beginning to think telling my mum that I didn't approve of what she wants to do might have been the wrong move. She clearly felt really passionate about this job opportunity, and she was excited to tell me. And I just shut her down because I didn't really think about how much she'd wanted this. AITA?",

We broke up after she revealed she was dating someone else behind my back and I got upset over feeling used. \n\nDetails :\n\nRecently, I dated someone who admitted that i was their first tinder date after a long period, eventually admitting she had a broken engagement awhile back that resulted in a psychological trauma.\n\nNow this has happened to me more than once. I guess I have a friendly and approachable look, fit, totally put together life, and very relaxed personality. I'm not an instagram model but I feel like I'm pretty competitive. I can go from matched on tinder to drinks at bar pretty smoothly thanks to confidence in dating and what i hope is a good personality. Usually this \"you're my first date on tinder\" scenario ends up with a quick drink and the realization that neither of us have any chemistry and we split. It has always stuck in my mind though, am I just a placeholder? A warmup act for women to date and bide their time while searching for a top tier tinder date?\n\nSo anyway, from the get-go I stated that I was interested in a serious relationship and pressed several times over the course of several dates that I wanted to learn more about what she wanted. I wanted to know if we were compatible or if I was wasting time. I never got a real reply, just vague answers or \"i'll tell you later\". Another red-flag was related to the fact that we both work in the same field, and she said on a date as a joke \"i was kind of hoping to use you for your network to get a job\", as she is unemployed in the field right now. That worried me but I brushed it off. Anyway, several dates later I got the breakup call, with the news that she's been dating someone else who she was able to open up emotionally with.\n\nI've been through plenty of breakups, and am usually pretty cool about it but this time I had a total emotional breakdown. Just a bunch of sappy texts really. I had been holding a lot of pent up emotion waiting for her to open up emotionally to me but she had been opening up to someone else.\n\nI feel like I was an easy person to date as a placeholder while she searched for another boyfriend. Specifically I feel like I did a lot of work building trust and confidence in her to start dating again, which she used to find someone else. She then dumped all that emotion from our relationship on the next dude line.\n\nProblem :\n\nI feel like I got used.\n\nShe feels I am deluded.\n\nAITA?",

I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, “You have to get something for me and (Sister’s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: “Oh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1’s name) and (Cousin 2’s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don’t just get something cheap.” She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don’t and won’t see often?)\n\nMe: “No thanks.” I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom’s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said “Maybe if you weren’t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn’t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!” (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I’m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI’m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n",

She seemed high yesterday when I saw her, I confronted her about it and she didn't say anything. I even asked her what did she do with it all? Where did you spend it at? She has no tag on her car, no cigs and no where to go. I told her I know exactly where it went. It went in a pipe. She comes over here expecting me to bail her out. I have no gas and no where to go.

I don't know honestly if she literally can't take care of herself, as in the mental capacity to do so or she just refuses to. I had to kick her out last summer for it, she threatened to kill me and was mean to my daughter high on meth. To make this worse is the fact she is a paranoid schizophrenic.

I have a new car and only want to get the salt and dirt off from the past week, and I don't like to go to ones that have the big bush washers in fear they could scratch my car so this was perfect. I get gas and pay for the wash there at the pump and get in line.\n\nOnce in line (about 7 cars ahead of me due to it being a Saturday) I notice that someone has stopped right after they exit the wash and is drying their car by hand. I think nothing of it until I see the next car is doing the same thing. After a little while I notice its the same guy, so someone is out there drying cars after. I assume its a homeless guy just trying to be nice and looking for cash. I figure I will tell him no thank you since I have no cash on me, usually never do unless I need it. When I go to a big car wash I have $$ to tip the people who take care of the car after the wash. Once I get closer and I'm about the 3rd car in line I notice this is an employee (not in uniform). They are going in and out of the side door of the wash to the front of the line, doing something and then going back in to go and dry cars. After investigating I see what he is doing.\n\nFirst he goes out to the front of the line, makes sure the car can pay or enter code and then proceeds to use a scrub brush and cleans the rims, salt areas, headlights and bumpers. He then goes into the side door and out the other side to catch the car coming out to dry it.\n\nNOTE: There is no sign or anything stating someone is doing this. \n\nI just let they guy do his thing, the brush looks new when I see him do it to the car in front of me so I figure there is low risk if him scratching my new car, by new I mean 2019 on a lease new. He brushes, I enter my code and go into the wash. My next assumption is that the blow dryer does not work, that's why he is out here. The area the station is at is a nicer part of town and the gas station was clean and well kept. So I go with this assumption and as I exit the wash, the blow dryer works. So I let it do its thing and as I pull up he walks up and just starts drying. I was going to tell him no thank you but could not do it quick enough before he was already drying so I let him. He comes to the window as I am about to pull away and just looks at me, I roll down the window and he says he is working for tips and next time to do that. I nod and drive off. He looked super annoyed and pissed when I had nothing but again, there was nothing saying he was going to be there and this is not a normal part of a gas station car wash. AITA??",

This took place over a decade ago and it's baffled me a handful of times since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn middle school, I was on the 7th grade girls volleyball team. I was a frumpy, awkward kid, and not very athletic or coordinated, but I did a sport every season because my parents thought it was good for me and the middle school teams didn't cut. I wasn't really friends with anyone on the team except one other girl. We had a few after school games with other middle schools nearby, and they ended at about dinner time. Most parents didn't go to games, except for those who volunteered to drive the team, so after the game ended we would call our parents to tell them they could pick us up. We probably sat around 15-25 minutes waiting for parents to get there. My mom would always pack me a snack, usually a handful of pretzels or crackers in a sandwich bag, and maybe like an individual serving of jello to eat while waiting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'd all be starving by the end of the game since we were growing teens and all that, so I'd pull out my snacks and eat them. The other girls on the team started saying that it was super rude of me to eat in front of them when they didn't have anything to eat. Like, multiple comments about how rude I was while I was eating my snacks. I didn't think I should have to share the small snack my mom packed me with seven or eight other girls, so I declined to share except with my one friend on the team. Like I said, it wasn't much to share. This happened at every game, so when I think back on it I think that they could've packed a snack at least for the later games, but they never did. When I did other sports in middle school this never came up; maybe because the games were scheduled differently or because sometimes some adults organized team snacks for us?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, was I the asshole? At the time I didn't really think much about it bc I was happy and eating and I thought it was their problem they were hungry for not being prepared. Not sure if it matters but most of the team were white girls who were super good friends with each other, and then me and my friend were both non-white and not really friends with the other girls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He was the one who offered the bet to me, which was surprising because he is known to be pretty bad at the game. I quickly accepted his offer and we began fighting. After a couple lost games I realized I was getting destroyed and a little tilted, so i did a big bet in an attempt to get my money back. I lost that one too, and at this point I owed about $160.  I decided that I wasn’t going to be able to beat him so I stopped betting against him and agreed to pay him the money that I owed him as soon as I had the money. A couple weeks later I wanted to get Black Ops 4 because my friends were all playing it and the same friend I bet against agreed to buy the game for me. The game cost about $35, putting me at about $195 in debt.  Fast forward to today, about a month later. My other friend who is known to be very good at brawlhalla told me that during the entirety of my bets, he was playing for the worse friend. He told me this because he didn’t realistically expect me to pay $195 so instead he should just settle for the $35 I ACTUALLY owed instead of the money that they tried to scam me from.  So I was a little bit pissed upon hearing that my friend tried scamming me out of $160 and I decided to test him. I pretended like I had the full $195 and was ready to pay him, and he said “okay yea ill take it”.

I push them to the side most of the time but I am sure they are unconsciously affecting my behavior to be more possessive in my mind. To clarify, this is all mild in my mind and I do not make it a problem for my friend group in any way, and I have not outright told anyone in the friend group of my attraction.

They were both brought in at different times and under the guise of fostering them. The first cat I agreed to foster, but while we were doing that she got attached and wanted to keep the cat. \n\nI said no, I don't want a cat, but she persisted so I made the deal parents often make - she can keep the cat if she takes care of it. She agreed to that and so we fully adopted that cat.\n\nIf my girlfriend went home for a holiday or something, I'll feed the cat and clean the litterbox, but otherwise my girlfriend took care of everything which was fine.\n\nRecently she wanted to foster ANOTHER cat, to which I said no we already have a cat and she would become attached to it. She begged and begged, promised it would only be for 2-3 weeks, and I guess I'm a sucker because I eventually said it was fine if it was only for a short while.\n\nFor reference, minor backstory here. My girlfriend is part of a group that takes care of feral cats in the city. She found this cat while it was basically on the brink of death. He needed his tail amputated and almost had to lose a paw as well. She said that we would only be fostering him until his wounds healed and he was off his medication.\n\nAnyway, that was 4 months ago. I wouldn't really care except that the new cat does not get along with our old cat. He keeps attacking her so we have to keep them separated and my girlfriend keeps trying to involve me more and more with the cats.\n\nOur original cat has grown on me but I'm not particularly fond of this new one because he keeps attacking our old one. I keep asking her when we're going to give him up, but it seems pretty apparent she has no intention of doing that.\n\nWe have to keep the cats separated, which usually means I need to bring our old cat into our office (where she basically lives now) so that the new one doesn't get cooped up in the spare bedroom.\n\nAnyway, I'm just tired of this shit. I felt bad for the cat which is why I eventually caved, but I do NOT want to adopt him. I honestly have no idea why my girlfriend got so attached and won't put him up for adoption. If he got along with our current cat I wouldn't care, but he doesn't and it has been FOUR MONTHS of trying to integrate them. It's clearly not going to work, but she won't stop trying.\n\nI basically bother her every night about when she's going to put him up for adoption or give him to a shelter and recently she's been getting pissy with me about how I can say something like that. It gets pretty close to the point of fighting and I just drop it because I don't care enough to get into a real argument about it, but it bothers me enough to vent about it here and check...\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of this cat?",

What happened was my husband and I used the free trial from Hulu for Live TV without telling her and then Hulu tried to charge her early for it. She called me screaming about it. I was supposed to tell her and that was my fault for not doing so and I apologized and told her we would pay her back the money for it because it was my fault. She said not to worry about it because the charge was reversed (because the trial wasn’t over, Hulu messed up).\n\nThe bigger fight started when she brought up getting an oil change for my car. Backstory on the car: I got an old car for my birthday from my grandparents that ran fine with my grandparents but basically as soon as I had it in my possession started to die. I could no longer afford to fix it so I started to think about getting a different car, because I was pregnant and would need it. I had no credit so I didn’t know where to start looking. My mom convinced me to sell my car and use that money to put towards a brand new car. My husband (boyfriend at the time) told me this was a bad idea, I should get a used car. My mom said, “you can’t finance used cars.” I believed her for some dumb reason. At the dealership I was told I can’t get the car in my name with no credit and I was ready to walk away but the sales guy and my mom convinced me to co sign. The conditions from my mom was that I let her see my daughter whenever she asked (which turned into every single day). So I let it happen.\n\nMy mom proceeded to threaten to take this car away a lot, but the hard truth was if she took it away, it would be harder for her to see my daughter (cause I would have to go north with my husband where he worked). She backed off every time. This time with the oil change, she demanded that we take it to the dealership to get it changed. It costs like $40, but I didn’t have to pay this the first oil change cause it was free. My husband (who I pushed my mom into because I was just done talking to her) told her we couldn’t  afford it and we would take it anywhere else for the oil change (we were in the process of moving as this was happening). She didn’t like that answer and proceeded to insult my husband and call him a bad father. His response was “your behavior makes it pretty hard for us to want you around our daughter.” I agreed with this response because she was being over the top. Her next message to me was “to lawyer up” because my husband just threatened to take my daughter away from her. She then called me and said CPS was on the way and the whole time at our apartment as she is taking the car and a dining table (she gave it as a gift cause she was throwing it away) she is screaming that CPS was coming and they would definitely take my daughter away from me because “just look at how you are dressed, you think you look like a fit mom?”\n\nI told this whole long story to give you guys an idea of how my mom is. She holds gifts over my head and will gladly take them away if I don’t give her what she feels I owe her.\n\nAITA for not wanting her to give Christmas gifts to my daughter?\n\nTL;DR my mom is highly manipulative and holds gifts over my head and takes them away when she isn’t happy.

In 2018-2019!).\n\nAnyways, things have been going pretty well, and I'm happy to have made a new friend.  The only problem is, I can not STAND hearing him eat.  I'm very sensitive to \"mouth-noises,\" and the sound of someone opening their mouth while chewing is one of the most uncomfortable sounds I've ever experienced; it's like nails on a chalkboard times 10 for me.  It's not something I can think away either, it's an uncontrollable physical response to hearing someone open their mouth while chewing.\n\nNow I realize that this is MY problem, and I don't want to tell anyone how they should eat.  And I've also avoided the situation a few times by just not eating with him.  Except there have been many times when I'm hanging out with my other friend (his roommate), and he'll sit next to me on the couch and eat his dinner, and I'll be crawling out of my skin with how uncomfortable I am.  I even lean as far away as I can and nonchalantly cover my closest ear, and it's still not enough.

This is because they have been emotionally abusing me for the last five years of my life (I’m sixteen now). My parents constantly belittle and criticize me for arbitrary things that I do. They’ve controlled my social life with my friends and tried to isolate me as much as they can. They listen in on the few phone calls I get and keep me from visiting my friends (many of whom I have lost contact with due to the five years of isolation). They have even pulled me out of the public schooling system and have chosen to ‘homeschool’ me (in reality, they don’t teach me anything). \n\nMy dad is always extremely aggressive towards me and lacks any sort of empathy for me. He used to be a good father, but he became a nightmare soon after my grandmother died. He tries to intimidate me constantly. He destroys the things I buy with my own money. Just last month, he took away a tablet that I recently bought with my own money that I earned working as a fast-food cashier. \n\nMeanwhile, my mom shows clear signs of being a narcissist. She constantly acts superior to me and refuses to acknowledge any of my feelings. Whenever I talk to her, she always ignores what I’m trying to say and constantly berates me for “not being good enough.”\n\nAs a result, I’ve resorted to playing video games as an outlet. At this point, my games are the only things that matter to me anymore. They’re an escape from the horrible life my parents create for me. \n\nI hate them. They think they’re the smartest people in the world, but they don’t know anything. They expect so much from me when they give me nothing. I want to run away from home soon. I would need to steal some more money in order for me to survive, but I’d do anything to get away from them.\n\nThe reason I’ve been stealing the money is to get back at them. Honestly, my parents have made my life a living hell, and I hardly want to wake up in the mornings. They always call me a spoiled brat whenever I play any video games. They’re always trying to take away my one joy in life, so I figured I would take away the only thing they seem to care about. Over the past year or so, I’ve been taking money from my parents and spending it all on in-game purchases and electronic devices. At the time, I thought it was only fair since they abused me and took away a lot of my stuff.\n\nBut still, a part of me feels a bit guilty. I know I’m being too generous considering my parents’ awful behavior, but I still feel like taking the money might have been wrong. Dad was really close to my grandma. He used to be nice before my grandma died. Mom’s been getting in a lot of fights with dad too. Sometimes, I wonder if maybe I’m doing something to deserve this.\n\nThat’s the full story, I guess.

I just want to be able to be a normal teenager--make mistakes and slack off sometimes--but I don't get the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has had abusive tendencies since I was young. Her first response to my negative behaviors as a child was to beat me, and when I got too big to beat, to yell and scream, knowing quite well I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She treats my younger brother similarly. He's 8, I'm 16.\n\nHere's an example of her behavior.\n\nA few weeks ago, she sent me in an Uber to pick up some food for her from Popeyes'. She demanded a particular deal that involved a leg, wing, and thigh, as well as a biscuit and drink, for 3.99. I knew damn well they didn't have that, especially in the pricy neighborhood I was in, but I asked anyway. I'm cripplingly shy, so I didn't want to press the issue, and bought her and my brother tenders by mistake.\n\nWhen I brought them home, she FLIPPED OUT. An honest-to-god screaming fit, tears, voice-breaking, the entire 9 yards, hollering she didn't like tenders, she wanted (insert dead bird parts here). To me, they're the same fucking bird, but okay, I guess. The part that pissed me off was when she insisted I didn't care about her because I didn't know she didn't like tenders. To this, I asked her which condiment I preferred--barbecue sauce or ketchup. She said ketchup. I like barbecue sauce. She insisted that it wasn't the same thing, and said I was inattentive.\n\nLater, she \"apologized\". Well, not really. She forgave me for bringing her tenders and said she appreciated my efforts. She did not say sorry for calling me, in so many words, an awful daughter. Over fried chicken.\n\nTo me, it was a completely childish response to a relatively simple problem. Howling your lungs out like a four year old because you got a piece of a bird and you wanted another piece of a bird is not how adults should behave. If I, a hormonal teenager, who has panic attacks about makeup sponges, can understand that, a woman in her forties certainly should. \n\nHere's another example.\n\nToday she screamed at and physically threatened my 8 year old brother for emailing the teacher about a missing assignment--to clarify, she asked him check Google Classroom, and he misunderstood . I was too afraid to go look, but based on the changes in her voice, she hit or pinched him at least once. In the same paragraph of speech, she insisted that TV/computer use is making him stupid and then said that he wasn't stupid and could listen to her. \n\nNow, from what it you've just read, she seems like an asshole. Granted. \n\nBut today, after more screaming when I told her she's always angry at us, she brought up two things: one, that I am ungrateful, and two, that me and my father aren't doing enough in the home to help my little brother.\n\nWith the first, I can kind of understand where she's coming from. In her mind, she's never wrong, and for me to be upset with her to the point of crying for throwing a skirt at me seems like a ridiculous and unfair thing to do. I disagree, of course, but I see her logic. \n\nWith the second, she's right. Completely. For a lot of my life, my dad has been just \"there\". He provides, and sometimes talks to me, but he doesn't try to do things with me or take me anywhere. He doesn't really give me advice unless I ask for it, or tell me to do anything if it doesn't directly pertain to him (i.e. I don't want to do this, so do it). He's the same way towards my younger brother (with some improvements). But my mother has made my brother into a little tyrant: he doesn't listen to or respect anyone but her. He fusses at me and is short with his father. We can't really tell him to do anything, and I can't really make him.\n\nAnd I admit, I am a lazy piece of shit. My room is a disaster, and other than taking care of our three dogs and making sure they're fed, clean, and toileted, I don't do much. I try to help with the sink--make sure stuff doesn't build up in there, and that kind of thing. I'm a senior in high school--I skipped a couple grades--and just generally going through some tough stuff right now, so it's kind of difficult. Studying for tests, keeping my grades up, making sure I graduate by getting my service hours--it's a lot on my plate. My workload has increased 1000x since last year.\n\nI'm also super irresponsible. Just in general. I'm working on it, but I feel like I lost a good chunk of my development to depression in the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. I feel stunted.\n\nAnd I'd just like to share that until very recently, my mother didn't do anything around the house. She has walked the dogs maybe 6 times in the two years we have lived here (she forces them to be in a little room near the garage because \"she doesn't like animals up under her\"\\[our dogs are cuddly\\], and complains that my room isn't clean enough to have them live permanently with us). She does not wash dishes, nor clean up after the rarity that she cooks--she recently started baking bread, and leaves the sink piled high with dishes every time. She then proceeds to complain that the sink is full of dishes and no one is doing anything about it. \n\nBut she works a lot. She just graduated school and is running three businesses. I feel like she resents me a little because I was born at a time that wasn't opportune for her and disrupted her life. I do feel like she's in the wrong a lot, but I want to extend sympathy to her. I can't imagine the amount of stress she's put herself through for us, and I am grateful for what she has done. I just wish she wouldn't treat us like shit and say it's fine because she provides for us. I didn't choose to be here. \n\nShe is not open to communication, and no amount of discussion will fix this, so I just want to know: is this entirely her fault, or are me (and my father) partially to blame? If so, how much?",

            "input": "(This is my first post here, tell me if I do something wrong)\n\nSome context: \n\nMy birthday is right around christmas, and so usually my family combines both of those celebrations to get me one gift per year (I'm only 17, turning 18 soon, and so I live with both my parents). I know, it already sucks enough.\n\nI also have grown up with a huge respect for money, because I've not been allowed to have a job, so I spend the money that I get very wisely. That's why, I usually look to any opportunities to minimize family spending, meaning that I usually only ask for one expensive thing a year during that one period. That being said, if something is too expensive, if one of my parents tell me that buying that thing is impossible for financial reasons, then I've never argued with them about it.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear in a bit, I'm a decently athletic person, with a decently healthy lifestyle, and I go the the gym very regularly, though I don't enjoy exercising.\n\nNow to get into the story:\n\nI ask my dad for a set of those trendy new true wireless earbuds. The ones I request cost around $140. Pretty expensive, I know, but not out of this world costly. My dad says no, because he's ordered me an exercise bike/desk combo (yeah, seriously) that costs around $170.\n\nAs I said before, I'm a pretty healthy guy, so believe me when I say I do not need this bike. This is not a passive-aggressive push towards a better lifestyle because I'm not unhealthy to start with. Naturally, I politely tell my dad that I'd rather not get that, because for my yearly gift, I would rather have something that I actually want. I ask him to cancel the order. \n\nI'm fairly adamant about this, and my mom is on my side, and so one day my dad tells me that he ordered the earbuds. However, the ones he ordered are of much lower quality ($50) than the ones that I asked for. He orders them prior to telling me though, so I can't protest. However, he says that if the earbuds are not of good quality, he will return them.\n\nI'm somewhat peeved, but decide to give them a try. They arrive, I test them, and they're what I expected: okay but not great. I'm probably somewhat biased, but after reading reviews, it's clear that there is a significant drop in audio quality.\n\nSo, I text my dad if he can return them. Here's where the problems begin. He accuses me of taking him for granted and caring about simply the price of things instead of the feelings behind them. He claims that neither I, nor my brother (he's eight years old!) have any gratitude for him. \n\nI then explain excessively politely that I'm simply annoyed at how he always buys things first and then tells me after the fact (this has happened several times where he buys something different from what I ask, and I am too timid to speak out). \n\nThis receives no reply.\n\nI then say \"Also, about (brother). He is far too young for you to have the expectation of him showing gratitude. You can have it for me, but not for him. Please dont extend any of this onto him because he definitely doesnt deserve it.\"\n\nHe blows up and accuses me of teaching him how to parent, and refuses to speak to me afterwards, not replying to any explanations that I have.\n\nAITA for thinking that instead of buying a $170 chair and $50 earbuds, he could've simply bought the $140 earbuds and called it a day? \nAITA for expecting him to speak to me before buying stuff for me?\nAITA for trying to protect my brother from my dad's toxicity? \n\nFor the cherry on top:\n\nThe chair and the earbuds have not been returned. The earbuds are being charged and the bike has been assembled. I'm fairly sure that he's using both of them, or at least planning to. So I'm left with no present whatsoever. I'm suspicious that he bought the bike knowing he would be the one using it anyway. I'm not sure because we haven't spoken in three days.\n\nFor years now, my dad has emotionally blackmailed me in ways like this, and it always results in days of not speaking to eachother before my mom (an angel btw) convinces me to go and apologize several times to maintain the relationship. I'm beginning to think that silence is better than continuously sacrificing my dignity.\n\nHere's to the new year. \n\nP.S. The reason this is even a post is because of how convinced my dad is that he is right. Maybe there is something I'm missing.\n\n",

I genuinely want everyone at the gym to have a fair and welcome time, and to follow whatever the social norms there are.\n\nHowever, today I am across a situation I'm unsure about. For context, I workout in an apartment building gym that has a decent selection of lifting equipment (rack, barbell, short barbell, curl bar, etc), but just one of each thing. Everyone using the facility generally shuffles around as needed, waiting for equipment or working in. It's particularly hard to handle benching and squatting simultaneously, as we have just the one rack we can use.\n\nToday I came across someone who had each barbell and the rack loaded, along with a handful of other things. Only this person and myself were in the room. I was immediately annoyed and asked this guy if he was using \"all of these\", and he said \"yeah.\" I asked how many sets he had left on the rack, and he said \"idk, about 30 minutes.\" He was clearly using each piece of equipment in a cycle, such that he'd do one set with one bar, take a rest, then do another set on another, take a rest, and ultimately use the rack maybe once every 10 minutes. Since the rack was set up at a bench height and I was planning on squatting, I asked the guy if he could focus on his benching sets so that I could use it sooner to squat (to avoid having to fully unload, rerack, repeat if we worked in). He immediately went on the defensive, saying \"you just got here and now you're telling me how to work out?! Wait your turn or work in\" I said \"you can't just use all the equipment like that, nobody does this\". Eventually after some arguing, he tells me to use the rack anyway, but put everything back \"exactly as it was\" whenever he came by. This sucks, but I had limited time so I went along with it.\n\nBetween sets he could talk to me about how people are reasonable and will let you work in if you don't show up with an aggressive stance like I did. I try to explain that my issue was that he's using every piece of lifting gear, and making everyone work in with him instead of focusing on his sets. He reiterates that I have no right to tell him how to work out. I eventually finish my sets and leave, though at this point we've both calmed down and exchanged names, for gentlemen's sake.\n\nMy feeling going into this was that forcing everyone to work in with you in a small gym instead of doing exercises one at a time was selfish, and I've never seen this before. Otoh, the dude has a point that I barged in and interrupted his workout and asked him to do it differently so that I could do sets without having to adjust the rack constantly or wait half an hour for him to finish. I'm not sure what the right gym culture is here.\n\ntl;dr: Guy at gym uses every piece of equipment on a cycle, I ask him to focus on his rack sets, he tells me to stop telling him how to workout.

Around a week ago by mom asked me what my shift schedule was for the week, I replied that I didn't know yet (because I had not checked, not because it wasn't out). She told me she wanted all of us (my entire family) to attend church with her that Sunday because it was a Christmas event, and they were providing dinner after. I never clearly told her no, I didn't see harm in going once because I stopped going to church with her regularly a couple months ago, it was fine as long as I wasn't working.\n\nSkip ahead a few days, and I did turn out to be working Sunday, but I was scheduled an hour after lunch. At this point, I decided I wasn't going because getting from the church to work would be too rushed, and I didn't want to be late for my shift. I told my mom what time I was working, but never told her no when she said \"you'll still be able to go\" because I knew that would ultimately end in an argument. \n\nWhen Sunday rolled around, my dad woke me up and I said I wasn't going because I'm working. He said okay and walked away. About a half hour later my mom knocked on my door telling me to get up because I'm going to church. I said no I'm working, it's going to be too rushed getting from the church and eating (there are assigned tables + line ups), and she yelled about it being \"family time\" and there was no reason for me to not go, and then said if I didn't go she would take the internet for two days. I said whatever and went back to bed.\n\nLater when I woke up and got ready for work, a couple minutes before I had to leave I was looking for the keys to drive and couldn't find them anywhere. I started to panic, and texted my sister because my mom and dad were not answering their phones. She said \"sounds like mom took the keys.\" And she did, and I had no way to get to work. I had to reluctantly call my manager explaining that I couldn't come into work because my mom took the keys, which he replied \"thanks for telling me\" and then said it's law (here) to call in at least two and a half hours before if you can't come in. I said I didn't know what to do, and then hung up. \n\nSo I ended up staying home, absolutely pissed off and upset that my mom took away my ability to go to work (I had already called in twice that week because I was sick). I decided to play games because if I'm not working why not, and when my mom came home she immediately took the internet. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if a) she hadn't already taken the car keys, and b) it takes away my ability to talk to my LDR boyfriend, as we can only talk via social media app (I don't have data), which she knows.\n\nI went up to her and said we needed to talk, in which turned into a screaming match between my parents and I. They said there was no reason I couldn't of went, and they only asked me for two hours of my time, in which I told them (also yelling) what I had said earlier about being rushed, and how it was unacceptable how my mom reacted. My mom told me to shut up and go to my room. I did, to calm down, and then about an hour later went back and apologized to her that I didn't go, and asked if we could talk again but like civil people.

I get absolutely 0 satisfaction from this job and I have really never been more unhappy working any role.\n\nI am also going to uni in September.\n\nI have pretty much decided that I need to leave this job asap for my mental health and overall happiness but my parents are very upset by it.\n\nMy mum also works for the same company and I am currently living at home (as this job is still not enough to pay rent in London) \n\nShe says she will resent me if I walk away from money as I have previously been dependent on her.\n\nI currently have £1.5k in savings and do not at all plan to rely on her financially.\n\nAITA for walking away from “decent” money in the pursuit of a more fulfilling job? I am genuinely questioning my own choices idek anymore.",

Last year my mum got a boyfriend who moved in with us even tho, he has a flat of his own and his daughter sleeps over pretty often too. Mum always said that I don't have to do well in school, but she wants me to be happy.\n\nA few weeks ago I got some bad grades, not terrible ones, but enough to notice. I'm mostly a good student, but I didn't have time to prepare for the lessons and had trouble with understanding some things in Maths.\n\nAfter seeing those my mother said that I should rethink my life and she doesn't want to hear any excuses from me. That stressed me out a lot, I'm afraid of being a disappointment. Later that week during a test I remembered the situation and couldn't focus on it anymore, so I did horribly.\n\nShe later messaged me (during a lesson) to talk about my grades and say she's worried. She also said that from her point of view it's \"a cry for help\" (I want to move out later this year and live with my girlfriend of 3 years, mother was fine with that). I told her how what she had said previously made me stressed and that I failed a test because of it. She replied that I should stop blaming her for my failings.\n\nI thought about the whole situation and asked my homeroom teacher to tell her that I'm doing perfectly fine, I'm pretty much the best in class and that it's okay to do badly sometimes. She didn't want to hear that from me, so I thought she would listen to the teacher.\n\nShe just came back from a parent-teacher conference and made sure to let me know how tired she was. She asked me, as if it were my fault, if I think it's okay for her to leave the house at 7:30 a.m. and come back at 8:30 p.m., she also asked me why I \"snitched\" on her (yes, she literally used this word) and why didn't I talk to her myself.\n\nSo AITA for not talking to her myself?",

Now, they weren't ever hostile towards me or gave any indication that they didn't want to be friends, but they just didn't seem to have any interest in doing anything with me outside of school. I noticed this with all of my other friends there as well, so when I switched schools I just decided to stop contacting them. I stopped texting them, didn't ask them to do anything, etc. Just to see if anything happened. And nothing did. No one tried getting in touch. So I just decided, fuck it, if you dont want anything to do with me then I'll stop trying. Now my friend texted me out of the blue, for the first time in months. Im not sure what to do.

I had stressed the importance of getting a 2nd story unit as I had heard reviews saying that the insulation between floors was awful. Unfortunately due to improper communication on the managements front we were stuck into a first floor unit. And it is as every bit bad as the reviews stated.\n\nThe first few nights of being there our upstairs neighbors would have their young child up and running around the unit until around 2-3am in the morning. Every footfall sounded like a hammer on our ceiling. I tried using my fan on a higher setting and putting in ear-plugs to dampen the noise. And unfortunately, it didn't do anything. I would just have to wait out the noise to go to sleep. \n\nI wanted to give our neighbors the benefit of a doubt, in that they probably had no idea how poorly insulated the units were. At this point, it was nearing the holidays so I had bought some cards and candy and thought to write them a friendly note. I delivered it to their door with some candies before work. It read like this:\n\"Dear upstairs neighbors,\n\nI don't know if you're aware of this, but unfortunately, our building's floors and ceilings are not well sound-proofed. For the most part, everything has been okay. However, there have been quite a few times where we have been disturbed and interupted while sleeping from the little tyke running and playing into the wee hours of the morning. We would appreciate if you would please take this into account.\nIf you have any questions or concerns we wouldn't mind meeting, We'd also like the chance to get to know you better😊!\"\n\nThe next few nights had been hit or miss, but enough that I thought they were trying. A week or so passes and I step outside and see someone had left their stroller next to the stairs of our connected units. It was pretty cold and wet out, and thought it would be frustrating for the owner to come out to a frozen or at the very least, soaked stroller. I felt incredibly nervous to but I walked up the stairs to see if it was theirs. I knocked on the door a couple of times to no answer. As I was headed back out to the parking lot I heard someone open a door. It was one of the neighbors. I stopped to say hello and mentioned why I had knocked on the door.  Once she figured out I was the neighbor underneath her unit she admitted that things could get loud since her husband came home late from work and that her child was up and down all night. I exclaimed that I really appreciated what they were doing and understood that young children could be up and down all night and that it was probably more the poor sound-proofing than anything. \nNot even two days later, I'm ringing customers out at work and lo and behold my neighbors come through my line. I didn't even realize it until the woman recognized me. She made a point to emphasize that they had left their daughter at home, which I thought was odd. Once she had been cashed out her husband walks over and asks if I was the one who wrote the note. I said I was. to which he asked me again a couple more times, slightly more aggressively each time. The Woman asked me if I had children in a way that made me unsure if she meant\n\"We heard strange noises from your apartment that sounded like cihldren.\"\n\t\t\t\tor\n\"How dare you judge us and tell us what to do since we have children and you don't\"\nAt the time I read it as the first and told them that I had a cat that occasionally knocked things over to get attention during the day and had a high pitched meow.\nBut to the second more likely interpretation, I have no intent on judging them for having children. I just wanted to let them know what could be heard from downstairs, in as polite a way as possible.\nThey had a pretty loud argument that night and its taken a couple more talks since then to get the noise settled down by midnight.\nTL;DR:  AITA for asking our neighbors to quiet down?\n",

Ex and I both had depression and anxiety at some point (I had pretty bad post natal depression both times and while I'd love to say he was super supportive and caring, he really wasn't.). He was incredibly difficult to live with, has a lot of autistic traits I didn't see in the beginning. I tried to involve him in caring for the kids, attending their appointments, but he had no patience with them and I often had to step in to avoid a meltdown. He did nothing to help keep the house in order, inside or out, despite both of us working and me pleading for help. Both of our children have autism and I believe he does as well. In the end I couldn't take any more, I'd begun to resent him because I felt unheard and unappreciated, more like his mother and maid than his wife or partner. I'm not perfect, I know he felt like I was too controlling and I'll admit that I probably was. Our children thrive on routine and it was always left to me to ensure it happened, my own anxiety was a factor in this as well. I didn't think either of us were particularly happy in our relationship but he claims he was.\n\nI'm in a really good place now, happier than I've ever been. The children have been spending 7 nights / fortnight with him and 7 with me (split into 5/2/2/5, not 7 straight) and they're coping really well with that. He isn't. He is deeply depressed and needs a lot of help (which he is slowly getting but has had to be hospitalised). Obviously the best thing for the children is that they spend the majority of their time with me until he's back on his feet. I respect him as a person and he's a good father. He thinks I'll end up taking them and they won't want to see him any more.\n\nI've accepted the fact his family and our friends (none of whom are speaking to me) think I'm the asshole here.

He has been dating Natalie for about a year and recently I went on vacation with the two of them to Montreal for spring break, along with our other friend and my partner. Natalie was completely obnoxious for the whole weekend. She seemed to view the entire experience as an opportunity to beef up her Instagram. She was taking pictures of random crap the entire time. At one point, she took away my drink at a coffee shop for three minutes as she tried to take the perfect picture of everyone’s coffee together on the table. Additionally, she was just kind of a party-pooper the whole time. She held Joe back from going places with the rest of us. She made Joe leave places early. She acted in a super immature way with the way she interacted with me and my partner (nothing I can put my finger on, she just was acting like a 14-year-old trapped in a college student’s body.) And on top of all that, she made some mildly homophobic comments that my partner and I did not appreciate at all. I never really liked her before, but suffice it to say, I was completely disillusioned with her by the end of the trip. \nA few days later, I received a Facebook message from Natalie. She created a group chat of six or seven people saying “Joe mentioned a while back that he wanted (thing) for his birthday. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to split the cost. It should come out to $15/person depending on the shipping cost.” Someone else in the group chat, my friend Mike, immediately replied “lol no” and Natalie removes him from the group. I am very tight on money lately because of the fact that I took a trip to Montreal for spring break so I’ve been trying to be more frugal. Natalie is from a very wealthy family. She has never had a job in college, and she travels abroad seemingly every other month. I usually buy Joe something small myself for his birthday, and the gift that Natalie wanted to get him is not something that would come from me, as it’s not related to an interest that Joe and I share. So in light of all that, I replied in the group chat “i’m sorry but I’m pretty tight on money! i can’t!” Natalie said “damn ok” and removed me from the group. Then I messaged Mike to ask him why he said no, and he said he was annoyed that Natalie kept Joe from his birthday party about a month prior to this. Mike and Joe are longtime best buds. \nFinally, just a few minutes ago, Joe and I went to eat dinner in our dining hall, and Natalie arrived along with her roommate and our other friend who came to Montreal. Natalie completely refused to acknowledge my existence for the entire 15 or so minutes we were sitting directly across from each other. As I was leaving, I said “bye everybody!” and she didn’t look up from her phone. It seems that she is pissed at me for not wanting to contribute to the gift. AITA?",

I'm now 29 and moved back into my parents house. I like to have a nice clean house so i keep my room clean and sometimes go on cleaning sprees where I'll clean the whole house.\n\nWe have had some drama in the past because of this. Basically, I try to clean something and my parents freak out, I mean like full blown insanity. I don't even clean it, I just suggest I might try cleaning it and ask if their OK with it. Its at this point that they just start yelling and say \"get out, get out right now, its our stuff don't touch it.\" And I try to remain calm but for some reason I don't instantly comply with their demands because in the moment I just freeze rather than instantly walk out of the room. their yelling gets louder and more aggressive and angrier which ends up making me mad so i may lose my temper and say something like \"fine, you want to yell at me for doing nothing... i might as well clean something\" I realize this is an asshole thing to do but I haven’t done this in a while but done it before so I guess this is what my parents are worried about.\n\nI hadn't cleaned up their part of the house like their room or their office in years and tonight I finished cleaning my room and since it was my moms birthday (my mom usually actually likes when I clean but I think since my dad hates it so much she agrees with him) and they don't have a problem with just dusting their problem is when it comes to moving their stuff around/organizing. So I figured I would do some dusting, no problem, everyone is happy.\n\nmy mom comes to see the room, everything is fine. I ask her nicely \"Can I straighten out this pile of papers? Just straighten out not move or anything\" She says well OK. So I start straightening out the papers. Then my dad comes up like a tyrant lunatic, doesn't even know whats going on and starts with the \"get out! get out! get out!\" And like I said I just freeze so they keep getting louder. my mom instantly sides with my dad and everyone's yelling at me and i'm generally calm and waiting for them to stop yelling so loud so I can decide what to do.\n\nSo yes, I probably shouldn't mess with my parents stuff in their room.\n\nI probably should leave their room the second they tell me to.\n\nAnd yes I should probably move out and get my own house.\n\nBut I still have the aching desire to make their house perfect.\n\nIn the times when I've managed to clean things it in the past and created trouble none of their stuff is ever lost and they usually really like how everything is so clean in the end. So sometimes I think maybe I should just let them get angry and clean their room for the greater good. Well lately I don't (past 15 years) because they are so insane about it.\n\nSo am I the asshole? and what should I do about still wanting to make the house clean? or is that a question for [r/Advice]",

My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and her boyfriend of about 6 years. Him and I used to be pretty close until he started becoming really manipulative towards my mom, then towards my sister and I. Let’s just say my sister and I aren’t drinking his shitty grape flavored bootleg kool-aid. That causes quite a bit of friction between us all. For example, this weekend I was at my dads house (only me, my sister (f19) is still out of town), which is usually a hard time for my mom and her boyfriend because they are not on good terms with my father, so generally when I get home from my fathers house my moms boyfriend is pretty irritable at times, other times he’s pretty cool. Today I came home and I was wearing a cropped shirt (which I am not allowed to wear, but my mom will allow it if I am wearing pants that are high waisted or a shirt under - basically if my stomach isn’t showing). I had just gotten out of the car and my stomach was showing a little bit because my pants had fallen down a little; before I could pull my pants back up or even say hi to him the first thing he says to me is him getting on to me about my shirt, and I mean he’s pretty aggravated about my shirt. I might be a brat for this but it upset me a little, so I said “well it’s nice to see you too.” with a bit of an attitude. He got pretty mad. He proceeded to tell me how I don’t respect myself because I dress like a whore and that he didn’t care if everyone else in the world does it, I can’t. I get where he’s coming from and all, but he couldn’t have said hi to me first or at least approached it better? He’s never been a father before he met my mom and doesn’t really understand how fragile a teen girls self confidence is, my mom said something to him about it, but then he told her that she’s making him out to be the bad guy because she doesn’t want to parent me. This happens quite often, but only when he is feeling stressed/insecure, which he just got bad news on Friday at a doctors appointment (he has type two diabetes and is in denial about it). I know he’s just trying deflect some embarrassment onto me, but Im getting pretty tired of it and beg my mom to leave him all the time. She says that he is her soulmate and that she would be miserable without him, but by staying with him she’s slowly losing her daughters. I persistently tell her that but it just angers her even more, ever since she’s met him she’s completely changed as a person. She’s I love with him and I know that she hasn’t had that in a very long time, so I feel like a bad person for resenting someone she views so highly. Im probably just going to move out after my senior year and only visit them once a year or so. I feel happier when I’m not around them and I think they’re happier without me.

I simply want anything, and I work at a store with a floral station, so I see every arrangement from $3-150(financially, he shifts from really well off to scraping by like bi weekly, so obviously I'm not expecting flowers on a bad week.. but if you go on a $400 tool spree and cant find it in you to buy flowers for ur gf...).

Also, my birthday just passed, and I HATE to sound ungrateful, but he just went to a store nearby that, admittedly we both liked, and the gifts are beautiful, but I can tell by the proximity and how random they are that it was an afterthought and he had NO plan to get me anything.

I just feel forgotten about,, meanwhile I'm waiting a month in advance for any gift giving holiday cause i cant wait to show him how much i appreciate him. We both come from relatively poor backgrounds, and its ingrained in me cost shouldnt be the drawing feature in a gift, it should show that you truely know and appreciate that person.

            "input": "I don't even know where to begin here. Unlike a lot of people I've never had any issues with my (soon-to-be) in-laws before - in fact my fiance's parents quite liked me the handful of times we've met, and we've always gotten along. The shit realllllllly hit the fan this past weekend though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my fiance travels a lot for work and was out of town for about a week-ish. During the weekend his mother was planning to come for her annual visit (we live near Phoenix AZ, she lives in San Diego CA) and was going to stay in our guestroom for a few days until he returned from his trip so we could all spend time together. The first day was fairly good, we went out to lunch and watched her favorite gameshow for a while, chatted about random stuff. We'd never gotten to know each other very well or spent time alone together so it was somewhat awkward, but it was fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then the second day when we go out to lunch is when things start going downhill... see, MIL is nice and all but is very naive and gullible, to put it nicely. She could hear something on the radio and immediately take it as truth without any sort of fact-checking or research on her own, which is something that's even gotten my fiance rather irritated with her on occasion. She is also very stubborn and likes to talk a LOT, so she will always give you her blunt opinion. And on top of this, she is a staunch Trump supporter and wants the wall built ASAP, because she believes \"all the illegal immigrants in San Diego are the cause of all the traffic\". Needless to say, I don't exactly share her views. Which that in itself isn't a problem, I've known she's rather conservative and made it a point to avoid politics as a topic of conversation so as not to cause any conflict. However, she wants to talk about anything and everything with me, and with the current political climate and government shutdown in place, she's very enthusiastic to discuss it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe begins asking me questions about my views regarding the shutdown, the wall, Trump, etc. I say I'd rather not talk about something like that but she insists, adding how ridiculous she thinks it is that \"Democrats won't fund the wall to keep our country safe\". I'm desperately trying to avoid giving my honest opinion and instead try to talk about something else, but she keeps poking at me \"oh come on, tell me what you think! Don't you think we should stop illegal aliens from entering our country?\" like she's expecting me to agree with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly she wasn't budging, so I just say I don't think the wall is a good idea and that Trump is causing even more damage than good to the country with this shutdown (Sidenote: my father works a government job and has been without pay during this period, so it's a bit of an extra touchy subject for me). Immediately her expression goes from an eager grin to completely stone-faced. I go on saying that most illegal immigrants come in through airplanes anyway and just overstay their visas so a wall wouldn't stop that, and she goes off saying that's not true because she heard this from Breitbart or that on Fox News and the president tweeted this and that and it's all the Democrats fault and blah blah. Which again, if that's your opinion then fine - I tend to respect others' opinions as long as they do the same for me. But she goes on this tirade trying to \"educate\" me and how I shouldn't by into the lies of liberal media or whatever. When she finally stops to take a breath I quickly say \"clearly we aren't going to agree about this so let's just not talk about it\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that quieted her down... for about 30 seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she starts mumbling about how I must've gotten my views from my mother (who is in fact quite liberal) and that it's so unfortunate that I've bought into all this false information and that we disrespect our president and country so much. Obviously this struck a nerve with me now that she's brought my mother into this, whom she's only met twice and my mother knows they have opposing views but has never said a bad word about her. So flat-out tell her that I'd like her to stop, I don't agree with her views and especially knowing how much my father is struggling to pay bills right now she's the one being rude while staying under my roof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis only offended her further, and eventually it just got to the point where I asked her to leave and stay with her friend in town or a hotel for the remainder of her trip. She was completely shocked and initially refused to leave, saying she had a right to be here because this was her son's house too and he invited her here (although she's never actually invited, she just randomly calls up and says \"hey I'm coming to stay from X day to Y day!\" but that hasn't been a problem since we only see her once a year and we shift our schedules around if needed). I tell her it's my house as well and she's no longer welcome to stay here if she's going to insult my family and argue with me over something as simple as a different viewpoint. So she huffs and gathers her stuff, gets in her car and drives off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely have a few minutes to take a breath and process everything that just happened when I get a call from my fiance, angry that I kicked his mother out of our home. I figured she probably just gave him one side of the story and spun it in her favor, so I explain what happened but he insists she would've calmed down if I just let her vent, and that I shouldn't have told her to leave. This irritated me and I said she's not welcome while I'm here alone and that she'll be staying elsewhere, which of course he wasn't happy about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance and I barely spoke the rest of the time he was out of town, and he was still fairly annoyed when I picked him up at the airport. He was especially upset because apparently his mother had left for San Diego early because of the incident, so he missed out on seeing her. Now that we've had some time to talk about it he understands my point of view, but since he sees his mom so rarely he can't help but feeling down about it and I'm left questioning my decision and feeling very guilty. I've considered contacting her to apologize even though I really feel like I shouldn't - in fact I've thought about barring her from the wedding altogether if this continues to be a persistent issue between us, because god forbid she starts drama with myself or my family at my own wedding. I'm not sure how to feel about this, so I'll leave it up to the fellow Redditers to determine if I'm the asshole.",

She knows very shallowly from my rantings about the industry, but she doesn't care enough to not want one. \n\nI have talked about the idea of synthetic diamonds, but she is not interested and wants the real deal. She has came back and said she would be fine with synthetic for the band, but she wants a decent sized real diamond in the middle, something around the 2k to 4k range.

I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.\n\nA few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.\n\nThe one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.\n\nThis was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.

Regardless, a couple of years ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine told me she was pregnant (two days after our breakup, ostensibly by me). I told her that whether to keep the child was her choice, but that if she wanted me to support this child and/or any of the medical costs of the pregnancy that there would have to be a paternity test, and that if she wanted to do it after birth I would pay her back half the medical costs then. She got furious at this, and it turned out later that the whole thing was a fabricated attempt (literally using a pregnant friend's urine) to manipulate me into getting back together. (She had BPD, long and fairly hellish story there, hence breaking up with her to begin with, though I hope she's doing better now.)\n\nSince then, though, I've been pretty conscientious about being up front about this. Any time things have gotten serious with a girl, when we have that conversation about wanting kids or not (I very much want kids), I make sure to mention that I would never, regardless of any amount of \"trust,\" put my name on a birth certificate without knowing for a fact the kid is mine. Even for a second, third, etc. kid with the same partner. Pretty much no ladies have had a problem with this.\n\nThe responses to that post, however, seem to be full of people asserting that the fiancé should just trust her and not take into account the massive financial, legal and time sink that can go into raising a child that isn't yours. People said he acted out of, for instance \"irrational fear.\" Given the average $233k cost (not including time and energy) to raise a child, and the $500 (max) cost of a paternity test, simple math tells us that if there's a 0.2% (500/233,000) chance of infidelity, it makes sense to get a test. And I mean, while everyone should trust their partner... why would you not make such a *tiny* investment to be safe?",

It was given to her as a gift and she loves the thing. \nMe, my mom and sister just came back home from the movies. I had to use the bathroom for a bit when I hear my mom telling me through the door that I need to change the bucket water that we use to clean the dogs pee with. So after I get out I do as she asks. I empty out the bucket into the toilet, and flush it down. Here’s where the fuck up begins. I open the shower door of the bathtub to replace the water and close the door a little harder than expected. The bathroom is right next to my sisters room. Apparently I closed it hard enough that the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom shook a little and what was on the shelves fell. At first I’m totally unaware of what just happened, but then she starts banging the wall and crying her heart out. “You just destroyed my limited edition mermicorno!” , she says as I see that part of the tail had broken off. My mother rushes into the room to comfort her and I’m just standing by the doorway as I’m watching her sob some more, eventually I can’t take much more of it so I just leave. After a few more minutes of hearing her heart wrenching sobs, the more and more I feel like shit. My mom comes out of the room and gives me the most accusing look. Apparently she’s told me time and time again that I shouldn’t close the bathtub door so hard because the wall shakes, but I sincerely can’t remember them telling me this. I was replacing some dog pads at this point and I just lose it as I scream at the tops of my lungs explaining that I feel like shit over what I had just done. I just closed a door, how could I have known this would happen?! I didn’t want to break this priceless toy of hers. My mom tells me to go fuck myself. I tried doing some homework to try to focus my mind on something else but I just become sort of catatonic at this point. A few minutes later I hear my mom talking on the phone, telling whoever she was taking to that “I know he’s my son, but he’s a fucking piece of shit...” it trails of because I can’t and don’t want to hear the rest of it. I just left the apartment and I’m writing this to just get outside the house. I tried looking up her toy to try to find a replacement. It’s sold out everywhere and the one copy is available on eBay for 800 dollars. It was genuinely an accident, and I may have been careless, but I feel like an asshole anyway.",

Over the last 6 months, he's been getting increasingly distant and I was starting to feel neglected. Not his fault, he had school and work and stuff. So I brought it up to him, and we worked out a compromise: we'd set aside time for each other once a week, even if it was just a simple phone call. \n\nAt first, we kept to it, making sure we spent time together at least once a week, and if we could afford the time then obviously we'd spend more time together. \n\nBut his new semester started, and it wasn't kind to him. He had a full schedule on most weekdays, but that meant one or two weekdays would be free per week. But he doesn't set aside time for me. I understand that he's busy, but once a week is really the least I can go in terms of maintaining a relationship. \n\nSo I bring it up. He calls me unreasonable for asking him to spend time with him at 2am. Alright, but I was trying to point out the larger issue of him not spending time with me, not saying we should spend time now. So I try and tell him, and he ignores me.\n\nHe's ignored me after fights, or if I bring up something he doesn't particularly like, so it's normal. Another \"rule\" we have is that we don't let fights go on for more than 24 hours. Partly because I have pretty severe anxiety and I need to talk things out to make them right, but also because he needs time to process what happened. So we came to a compromise, within 24 hours we would reach out and contact each other.\n\nBut after 36 hours, he hasn't responded. So I sent him a long message telling him that I didn't feel like continuing the relationship with him, because I date for marriage and I can't marry someone who is not willing to spend time with me at least once a week.\n\nIt wasn't just the spending time aspect, I think. It was how we negotiated those rules for him to break them. I was really trying to come to a compromise with those rules, like spending time together once a week and talking after a fight after 24 hours, because I really do need to spend time with someone to maintain a relationship and I really do need to talk after a fight to reassure myself, but he just disregarded those even though I'd talked to him before.\n\nSo, AITA?

I was always secretly rooting for him.\n\nTime jump to their senior year of highschool, she gets out of a terrible relationship, bounces around a couple guys, falls into a very deep depression and only continues to rely on \"boyfriends\" for emotional stability. N is by her side as the best supportive friend he can be. After a few rounds in hospitals and seeking mental care, they decide to become a couple. She is doing great, but obviously still has moments of emotional instability and depression.  In fall of her senior year she decides to move out of our parents' house because \"they are crazy and controlling\". She had just turned 18 and had convinced herself and her friends and friends' parents my parents were crazy and not allowing her to be an adult. They only had 2 rules, don't get drunk and don't smoke in the house. Other that those 2 things, she was free as a bird now that she was 18. After a lot of emotional trauma for the whole family, she moves in with N, now her boyfriend of 3 months.\n\nFast forward to about 6 months living with N and his mom and stepdad. We are seeing very serious signs of emotional abuse and she eventually tells us of physical abuse as well. Not only this, but her depression has been even more extreme and she has frequent panic attacks, almost all with N being the cause of  stress. After  6 months of us telling her we will do anything to get her out and basically telling her she needs to leave him and she can live with either parent or myself, she decides to finally do what she needs to be better. She moves out of his house, breaks up with him and moves in with me (I have my own house about an hour away). She does all of this over one weekend, after deciding it is what's best for her.\n\nFast forward to 1 month later, after sitting on my couch for 2 weeks without a job, my parents buying her a car, all new furniture for her room, she decided she needed to give N a second chance. K also now denied all accounts of any emotional or physical abuse from N. K texted my family in a group text and basically demanded we accept her choice and tell her we love her, or she won't talk to us or be in our lives anymore. And this is something she would follow through with as she has shut some of us out for months at a time before.\n\nNow, currently a month after K got back together with N, all of her stuff is still at my house, but she has been living with him and his mom and stepdad while she waits to find her own place. K did decide she shouldn't live with N anymore, but that they should still be in a relationship.  \n\nNow she is asking me to let N come with her to my house and hang out and help her pack to move back.

I’m in my last year now. A couple of days ago, my sister also moved back with plans to start grad school in the fall. So...it’s a little crowded. My sister rented a uhaul for her stuff and had it parked in front of the house. My mom and I took it back yesterday, with my mom driving the truck and me following behind in my car. Then, we drove back home together.\n\nMy family and I live in a row house. There’s a parking spot right in front of the house, and another one down the street. Those spots are where my parents park, and I usually park on the street. So I’m driving my mom home and I go to park where I usually park, and she tells me to just park in the spot in front of the house. I kind of protest, because I don’t want to have to move my car later, and tell her I’ll just drop her off in front of the house and then go park on the street. At this point she gets a little irritated with me and tells me to just park in front of the house and leave it alone. I’m like, fine, whatever, not a big deal. \n\nLater that day my dad comes home and asks why I’m parked in front of the house. I told him what happened with my mom. I can tell he’s kind of annoyed that I parked there, but I don’t think it’s a big deal so I just brush it off. \n\nNow today, I have the day off and I’m just hanging out at home. I go to the basement and am working out on the treadmill when my dad comes down the stairs. He says: “hey, so your mother and I had a discussion about the parking spot and it’s okay if you move your car”. Now at this point I’m irritated. I said something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I know I’m ALLOWED to move my car, all I said is that I parked there because mom told me to and I didn’t feel like arguing with her!” Now I know I kind of blew up here, but I was annoyed because  i could tell he just wanted me to move my car and I don’t like when people beat around the bush. \n\nI finished my workout, took a shower, then I’m just in the living room when here comes my dad again. He looks at me and says “you know, whatever issues your mother and I are having with the parking spot, you don’t have to get into the middle of them”.\n\nSo now I’m furious. I tell him “I have no idea what you’re talking about! If you want me to move my car, just ask me to!” And he just walks away.\n\nSo I’ve decided I’m not moving the car unless he explicitly asks me to. It’s now apparent to me that my mom told me to park in the spot to piss off my dad. But honestly that’s none of my business and I had no idea when I parked in the spot. I just want to get my degree and move out, I have no interest in being involved in my parents marital drama.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not moving my car (even though it seems obvious my dad wants me to) because he won’t ask?",

Despite this we realized we are completely right as friends. We still hang out regularly because we have similar hobbies and humor and have mutual friend groups. I have been dating my current boyfriend for four months now and it’s great. We’re nothing similar like me and my ex, but we connect on greater level where we aren’t fighting all the time like I was with my ex. It’s a much better relationship. Because my ex and I are so close, he and my bf have hung out a couple times with me and others. Both times it seemed fine and they actually got along well.\n\nHere’s the problem: In March a few of my friends are going to Maine to go hiking and see a friend couple who recently moved. My ex is among these friends going. I mentioned it to my bf and he wants to come and...I don’t want him to lol. First he doesn’t even know those friends and two, these are my friends. I want to be alone with them. He just came from some game convention thing with his friends that I didn’t even ask to go to (for one thing, idc about games) I know people need time with their friends. I told my bf I didn’t think that was a good idea and he said he didn’t see the problem since two people who are coming are in a relationship. However, they were already in the friend group and not a couple when I first met them and they’re the only couple besides the one in Maine. He got upset and said he only wanted to share an activity with me and feels bad that I’m more okay with spending time with my ex than I am with him and that I act very cliquey. However, I only spend time with my ex because we’re friends. If I hated everything about him, obviously I would not want to hang out with him.

I did get annoyed with how little they cleaned.  But there wasn’t any problem until I told them that I didn’t want a dog in the apartment. I was really vocal about not wanting a dog and within the week they came to me and told me that they wanted to move because I was messy and I didn’t get along with them. I did the dishes and trash everyday, and was the only person consistently picking up the apartment. I will admit that they probably cleaned up after me three times total, in the entire semester that I lived with them. But it’s not like I wasn’t cleaning up after them almost every week either.\nWhen they found out that the housing policy would require them to pay almost 2k each to leave they dropped the subject and decided to stay. I was pissed at this point and decided to avoid being in the apartment as much as possible, and spent a lot of time studying on campus. I also made sure to never touch their messes to establish how little they do around the apartment.\nAfter having my roommates boyfriend of three days move in for the rest of the semester (who was like four years older than us, and cooked just to leave the pots and pans out for the entire day)  and pretty much having petty fights every two weeks I was pretty tired. After another scuffle, I decided to pick up a friends sublease, and dropped the 2k needed to leave and began to pack up my stuff without telling them. I bought the majority of the cleaning supplies and all of the bowls, plates silverware pots and pans so I knew they were going to be stuck without a kitchen with me leaving so unexpectedly. They came home mid-packing session, and they were mad enough to tell me that they were moving in a week, and told me how rude I was for leaving without notice. We fought over the next two days of me packing and leaving. I had to throw away one of my roommates moldy bathroom rugs during the semester, and after “her mom badgered her about it” I ended up forking over 25$ for a bathroom rug that she said was okay to throw out.\nAfter officially checking out of my “room” I rented I got a call from my roommate accusing me of taking her collectible plastic cups, they were 8$ each and she was “ missing” ten of them. She wanted me to pay 80$ for them. I genuinely thought that maybe I had grabbed them on accident, and after checking ALL of the stuff I packed I realized that the cups were probably back at the apartment. I tried to tell her I didn’t have them and got into a screaming match with her over the phone. 30 minutes later my mom got a call from their parents claiming That I was going to be reported to campus police for stealing almost 100$ of their babies stuff and a bunch of other stuff I didn’t do. Like sell weed out of the apartment, spent all my money on liquor, and forced my roommates to drive me and my drunk friends around. \n\nSo I ghosted them. The semester hasn’t started yet, but I’m worried I’m going to be taken to small claims court over plastic cups ",

Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, “overloading the baby’s little body”. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she’s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She’s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can’t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she’s somehow positive for it. (She’s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I’m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I’m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn’t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I’m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe’s up in arms about this now saying how I’m being manipulative and abusive because I’m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she’s not. \n\nI don’t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it’s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she’s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she’s said how it’s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I’ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I’m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don’t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She’s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I’m comfortable with. I can’t go further than that. And now she’s upset that I’m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit.

For backstory I'm a 18YO (M) depressed, anxious guy, I finished HS 1 year ago, and took a year off (basically spent 2018 doing absolutelly nothing) I never had a job, umfortunally depression got the best of me I guess. Anyway, yesterday my uncle came here to make dinner (paarents were on vacation, only me and my grandmother home) so, he is there doing whatever, and I'm here, playing on my 3DS, on an online match. Out of nowhere, he comes ate me and tells me to go buy some Ketchup, because he needs 'em. I tell him to wait, as I'm playing, he tells me to go at once and I ask for him to wait again. He then scream \"dude, I'm cooking hurry\" and I say \"okay, lemme just--\" he slaps me on the head. Oh boy, I lose it there, I punch in in the stomach and he starts yo get all angry, full of himself. He nearly broke my 3DS too. So, I decided to go at once (sorry to whoever was playing with me) and on the way I shout at him \"piece of shit\" he instantly comes at me with his fist closed, with a grin on his face and by there I'm ready to (try to) punch him too. If it werent for my gramma, we would have fought right there. Anyway ff, he's gone, he text me asking if I'm angry, tells me he was wrong for hitting me, but I was also wrong for not \"obbeying\".  He then tells me that I don't have a job, I don't help with anything and that I SHOULD do everything someone asks me, and that we live in a society and some shit like that. I send him a long text explaining that I can barelly leave my bed, and That I'm bordeline suicidal, and that I feel like a leech for my family, and that its hard to even do most things when I feel like that. he just says that he understands, says that he'll kill me if I kill myself, but that I still should do everything someone asks me. He also told me that Im lucky I have a home, and that I'm not abused by anyone etc..\nNow, I'm not gonna lie... I'm lazy as FUCK. Like really lazy. All I do is take out the trash and help my gramma as she cannot move very well. That is not to say that I'm ungratefull for what everyone offers me (home, food, internet), I never complain, and I rarelly spend money since I dont leave my house really. Also, I AM looking for a job, I'm just not lucky with that. Later on my grandma said that \"we were both wrong because he hit me  but I also didn't obey\".

I’ve never played with this person before so like with anyone I’ve not met, I avoid displaying my full personality because I don’t want to upset them or annoy them. This is something I assume a good amount of people do when meeting new people.\n\nAnyways, during our squad session, we’re dropping into heavily contested areas where the gear / guns are good.  What that means is that there will be a lot more squads also in that area trying to get a gun and to secure the area. Because of this, there’s a heavy emphasize on getting a gun quickly so you can fight.\n\nOn this one particular match, his friend and I drop into the same house and I (because I have no gun yet) run to a ‘golden’ weapon (this means it’s fully modded). At the same time, so was also his friend (who already had a gun). I ended up getting it first which he openly complained about through comms, which irritated me. \n\nAs a way of conveying my anger, I had the ability to heal him and chose not to (deployable healing drone - he had no meds). We lost the match, and he continued openly complaining about me. But not directly to me, in the third person, AS I’m listening (he knows this). I’ve had this happen to me before IRL and felt triggered, so I left discord which my friend noticed and said, “nice rage”.\n\nI don’t view this as raging, but rather not having to listen to someone that’s being rude IMO. I told this to my friend and he just repeated the same crap again. His friend made further comments to me in attempt to communicate with me in-game such as, “we can win if we work together you white prick”. I muted him there as well and told my friend I thought his friend was an asshole and that I didn’t need to listen to his crap.\n\nSo here we are now, days later my friend and I are playing and he leaves to go play with his friend. That ends our session, so I leave to go back to my room say I’m obviously not welcome here (this subject still triggers me) to which he replies, “ maybe if you dont rage”.\n\nSo, AITA, or is my friend and his friend? \n\nSorry for errors, on phone.",

We started discussing marriage and made a mutual decision that it was what we both wanted. He asked me about the ring, and I told him I would prefer not to have an engagement ring and would rather we both pick out inexpensive bands together that we both put on at the wedding. He agreed with this and also said he doesn't need an expensive band for himself. I also told him that I don't need a proposal, but he told me he really wanted to surprise me with one and that he had been looking forward to it for a long time. I told him that I'm excited to see what he comes up with and that I'm looking forward to saying yes\n\nMy reasons for not wanting an engagement ring are 1. I don't like the sexist nature of the tradition that the woman wears an engagement ring, but not the man and 2. I would feel really nervous wearing something that expensive on my hand all the time. I would much rather have a simple symbol of our bond that we both share equally and put on together at our wedding.\n\nFast forward to the end of January. Fiance and I both take some time off work for a nice vacation in the mountains. On a hike he gets down on one knee and proposes. It was really magical and he did a great job. The only problem is the proposal also included a really nice looking ring. Of course I put it on in the moment and said I love it but I was really miffed my fiance didn't respect my request.\n\nWe talked about it later and I found out that he spent over 1000 dollars on it. I feel terrible that he dropped so much money on this and I'm constantly worried about losing it. I have not been wearing it and kept it in a box in the drawer so that it doesn't get lost and he seemed really hurt by this. I told him that I never even wanted a ring in the first place and he thought I was just saying that because I didn't want him to be out so much money. I also told him my reason about thinking the tradition is sexist and he said he wasn't trying to be sexist and thought it would be meaningful to me.\n\nI want to tell him to take it back but I don't want to hurt him even more. On the other hand I really don't want to wear it on my finger for the rest of my life, knowing it's so expensive and that he is not doing the same thing and gets to wear just the band like I wanted to. It would make me feel like we are not equal partners.\n\nTLDR: I said I didn't want a ring and fiance got me one anyway. Now I want to ask him to sell it/take it back.

We were extremely close and most of the things I enjoyed were because of him, (Basketball, Volleyball, Card Games, Some Online Games), but thats besides the point. A little before he turned 16 he got his first car (‘99 Honda Civic $1000) that was perfect except for how it looked. We often went places and I never “mocked” him for having a bad / old looking car because in my eyes it was perfectly fine for a car. \n\nFast forward by about 2yrs he’s 17 and I’m around \n1 1/2 months from my birthday. He worked hard and got his parents to agree to price match a new car for him. He put $1800 in for a ‘07 Mustang ($3100) and his parent matched him with the extra going towards the small bit of needed fixes. I was extremely happy for him and even joined him when he drove to go to repair places to get the standard new car fixes like oil changes. The only real problem with the car was a slightly bent hood, something you couldn’t notice from more than 10ft away. \n\nFast forward a month and now its 2 weeks before my 15th birthday and since I know my family didn’t want to pay much for my car I was expecting something basic similar to my friends first car. Since I have to drive 40 miles to and from school everyday when I get my license we has to get something with low miles and high mpg. While I was sitting in my room doing nothing my mom knocked on my door and told me to come outside. What was waiting there for me? A red ‘02 Camaro! ($3200, small paint problems and a few things needed replacing but no major problems). I was so happy and excited for my permit so I could drive but the first thing I did was text my friend saying I got my new car and to come over.\n\nI heard/saw his car coming up to my house but instead of stopping, he just drove right pass. It confused me a small bit so I asked my dad if he could drive me to his house with my new car to ask his opinion but when we go in front of his house we saw him get out of his car (with his brother and friend, both I know semi-well) and walk right past us into his house. I was kinda bummed knowing that he was mad but normally he gets over things after a little while so I let it be and texted him 1 week later about going to a volleyball open gym that we normally go to. These are the texts.\n\nMe: You going to volley?\nHim: Maybe why?\nMe: Bc I’m going and wanted to know if you’re driving\nHim: Well why don’t you drive? You’ve got a nice new car.\n\nThis was before I got my permit. \nThe rest of the conversation went similarly with him kinda saying things that made it sound like I’m a huge asshole and was getting mad about how my car was a little more expensive and that I didn’t work for it. Eventually I told him that when he got his car I was happy for him so now he should just grow up and be happy for me.\n\nThere was another point when he said that my parent’s buy everything for me which other the my first good pc (Christmas 2015 ~$1000) I have bought anything over $50 by myself. Ex. Oculus Rift, Xbox One, PS4, PS4 1TB, my current computer specs (~$1300), my shoes (totaling ~$260), my 3ds xl ($120) and pretty much anything over $50. The only times I get something is during my birthday/christmas which even then never go above $200. He get things given to him worth the same to more than I do. Ex 2 pairs of nice shoes after getting honor role on a report card.\n\nIf you couldn’t tell by that rant this is what really got\nme annoyed and stop texting him. I haven’t talked to him at all since (4 months) but whenever I think about it I get really annoyed. I understand where he’s coming from, he had to work but I didn’t, but he doesn’t have to treat me like everything is my fault. \n\nThis is the story but the question is, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My parents payed for my first car that was around the same price as my friend’s 2nd car that he price matched with his parents to get. ($3200 against $3100 split 2-ways). Now he’s mad at me.\n\n",

I recognize that as an important, and legitimate reason for missing the game. \n\nThat being said, after the 3rd week, I told her that if she didn't start showing up to game in the coming weeks, I would not hold her spot in the game anymore. I only run 4-5 players at most and we had 5. Now, this was not a threat, nor was I kicking her out. It simply meant that if she didn't start coming regularly then I would give her spot to another player if one wanted to join and showed up regularly. I felt it was an imposition on me the GM to hold a spot for someone who wasn't showing up regularly. This situation was also made worse by some inter-player drama that occurred a month earlier, but that is irrelevant to this situation. \n\nNow, I admit in hindsight that I was a bit of a dick in the way I presented that to her, making it sound like an ultimatum. It wasn't, nor was it intended to be. While I could have handled the situation better, I feel my reasoning in the matter was sound. I wasn't trying to be rude or threatening, just informing her that after a certain point of missing the game that I felt I couldn't hold someone's spot. She eventually returned and all was great, but if you're going to be gone for a prolonged period, it's a bit of an imposition to refuse a new player for someone who isn't there.",

It took about a year's worth of love and therapy, at the end of which we got together, to get her out of the deep depression she was in after he dumped her.\n\nWhen started Dating, M suddenly took interest in D again, he continuously pestered her to be friends with him (which I was adamantly against. Might sound controlling of me, but after learning the kinds of things he did to D and other girls I just couldn't allow him to be near her). After 2 years of this D agreed to be friends with him - D's therapist WHO KNEW THE THINGS HE DID advised that D befriend him as a means of \"letting go\" of the past and forgiving him.\n\nI voiced my objections to this the moment I found out, but eventually accepted it because it was what D felt she wanted. \n\nOver the course of the next 2 years, D would get increasingly flirty vibes from M(late night Texts, long hugs, surprise kisses on the cheek, etc), and even though I wanted and should have told him off (or beat the shit out of him) - D would tell me not to, and that I should trust her transparency about it and just ignore him - so I went along with it. That was until I found out M was getting way too flirty with D and was driving her down and away from her life goals that she had been working so hard towards - after and incident where M confessed he still loved D and kissed her when she was in no position to resist (I was not there at the time, but her friends were and did nothing to help her), we talked about how D needed to stop interacting with M - She surprisingly agreed to that, and was realizing how toxic M was to her and her future. \n\nA month or so later I found out that they were still hanging out and doing things that might not have been cheating, but were definitely not good for our relationship and her mental health.\n\nI confronted D about lying to me, and told her that she needs to stop seeing him or its over between us - to which, and I quote, she said \"I can't decide which one of you I love more\"... I told her things were over between us the moment I heard that.\n\nSince then I've been getting texts from her friends calling me an asshole and saying how much they always hated me. I also learned that D has been hanging out with M to cope with apparently the worst thing to ever happen to her, which was me... I honestly feel like I made the right choice, but I'm starting to question myself.... so AITA?\n\nTL;DR - I dumped my now ex because she continued hanging out with her friend who was her extremely abusive Ex, even after she promised she wouldn't.",

We lived together in TN until I moved out to ATL at 17 because of her domestically abusive boyfriend. She had a child with him and my half-brother is now 5. She ultimately moved to Seattle to get away from him. She was in Seattle for less than a year before her twin sister, and later her mom, kicked her out for allegedly being too difficult to live with. I offered her to move in with me so she can start fresh, get a job, save for a car and ultimately get her own place for her and my brother. Since she’s been here for the last 5 months I’ve: built a resume for her, my sister has applied to numerous jobs for her, she has applied herself for 0 jobs herself. She despises my GF and was mad at me, at the time, so she destroyed my relationship by FB messaging her that I was cheating on her. My lifestyle has changed significantly as I don’t care to have people over now that I’m essentially living my mom again. She is as my family put it “difficult to live with.” My new stress has factored in to me drinking more which she profusely points out, as if this is the stem of the problem (I’m a mellow quiet drunk just so there aren’t any ideas).  I’ve been through so much stress since she has been here. She has once locked me out of my own apartment when she was angry with me. My utilities have literally tripled as she is nonchalant with energy usage. She offers nothing towards rent or bills and I’ve been fiscally struggling since she’s been here.  I told her that I would be ok through all of this if she would just get a job and advance her situation. She says she was depressed and that’s why she hasn’t looked for a job. I suffer from depression too but if had a kid I wouldn’t let anything stop me from providing for my child. I don’t want to end up hating my mom by prolonging this situation. I told her she needs to make plans to leave. AITA for kicking my mom, and therein my brother, out?",

I tried to make her drink water but it was too late I guess. I went with her to the bathroom where she puked. I took her outside to get fresh air and she was sitting on a bench complaining she’s cold and wanted to go home. I kept telling her to drink water and assured her that we were just waiting on my husband so we could leave.

I just want to know if I did the right thing. Here's the back story: \n\n\n\nSome months before I got pregnant I got a call from the hospital after a routine PAP smear test. They found cancer cells and I was to visit them ASAP. This is all after a year of remission from my breast cancer. They told me I had to quit the birth control pill because the hormones could be influencing my cervix. I quit that day and had planned to get a coil in after my second period. \n\n\nA week later I got my first period. But the second period never came. I went to my GP and said \"doctor, I'm now 1 month over time for my period and I'm worried\". He said \"don't worry, it can take up to 6 months for your period to regulate again\". So I had no worries. He didn't recommend a pregnancy test. \n\n\nTwo months after this my SO tells me I'm getting fat and to get a test. Test comes back positive. I immediately call my GP. He tells me to come in for an ultrasound. He puts the apparatus on my belly and starts laughing, like full on laugh. He turns the screen my way and there on the screen I see my daughter for the first time. Her head, back, rib cage, legs, all are formed. This is no just conceived embryo. He tells me I'm at least 3 to 4 months in. So abortion is still possible but I must make the decision very quickly. I decide to keep it after discussing with SO.\n\n\nI'm very pro-choice, and if I was maybe 1 month a long instead of 3 the possibility of me aborting it would be 90%. But it was a person in my mind. \n\n\nOur situation is also not great for raising a child. Here's a list: \n\n\n- My SO is 21 years old (20 when I got pregnant), and still in college. He won't be done with school for another 4 years. \n\n- My SO is in huge debt because of parking/insurance tickets and all his finances go towards that (which is good, I want him to be debt free, but it needs to be considered).\n\n- We do not own a house or rent a place, we live with my father (who now also has to deal with this new born, he's 65 and recently retired). My father agreed to give us the upper floor of the house (3 large bed rooms) to create a nursery, a bedroom and a study room. \n\n- My income solely goes towards renovation of these rooms, the baby things we need and whatever is left is for our food and other expenses. I also save 10% and another 5% for little one when she's 18. My net income a month is between €2200 and €3000. \n\n- I'm currently on maternity leave but before this I was working as a consultant. I lost the project I was on because of maternity leave. My boss is looking for a new project for me to start after maternity leave. But it could mean we have to live on 70% of my income if he can't find anything in time. \n\n\n\n\nSo with all these points in mind am I the asshole for keeping her and wanting to raise her?",

It started out as friend with benefits and then the lines kind of blurred but we never took the next step. We had an amazing run in the beginning, but in the end there was a lot friction, hurt feelings, I noticed my personality changing in a way I didn't like at all (e.g. I started snapping at minor things while compromising on things that I shouldn't have) and when I couldn't take it anymore I told him we shouldn't see eachother anymore. I later reached out again to tell him that once our emotions have cooled down, I was open to try and work things out, to see if we could get our friendship back at least (I'm aware of how naive that sounds, but we honestly used to be great together and I wasn't ready to completely give up on that at that point in time). \nThat was about ten months ago. A couple weeks back he messaged me and we caught up on eachother's lives a bit. I gave him about a week of just chit chat to get accustomed to eachother again and things actually went pretty good until I told him that I'd like to actually talk about what went wrong last time, because I don't see this going anywhere unless we learn from our mistakes back then. He pretty much immediately shot me down, telling me that he's happy that I'm doing well but messaging me was a mistake and we shouldn't continue.\nTo get to the point of this AITA: he works at a really cool place that I never went to during the past ten months, out  of respect for his 'territory'. However during the time after he contacted me again, when we were exchanging pleasant chit chat, I made plans to got to an event there with some friends and last night we went there and had a great time. I didn't expect to actually see much of him, he doesn't work in the service area but more behind the scenes, but we did come across eachother a couple of time during which he either ignored me or honestly didn't notice me (I doubt that though, not noticing four people that you know just a couple of feet away from you seems a bit implausible to me). So if I judge the situation correctly, my presence did make him uncomfortable. And even after all that happened between us, part of me really wouldn't like him to come into work every day dreading to be confronted with memories and feelings he'd rather not deal with (by seeing me, I'm not planning any kind of active confrontations). Another part of me thinks that he needs to get his head out of his ass and actually deal with his issues.

A coworker (not on my team but same department) kind of pushed me (and yes I'm a pushover) to let him rent from me.\n\nSo yes he's my roommate and my tenant.\n\nHe pays seriously low rent. He pays about 75% of the low end of what he might pay elsewhere (60% of what he'd have to pay if he split an actual apartment). He pays about $100 total for all utilities (cable, internet, water, sewage, electrical, gas) and I pay the actual bills (my portion is easily 3x his).\n\nTo be clear, he **is not a bad guy and he would probably pay if I asked for more.**\n\nIt's just that it's my house and I kinda want to enjoy it by myself. Plus a lot of things he does annoys me. He left the fucking front door open once! I have security cameras and he just makes fun of it and constantly forgets to arm it. He never turns the light off anywhere. The few rules I have for safety purposes he forgets (don't turn on the dryer and leave the house, please for the love of god unplug the god damn toaster oven). He rarely takes the recycling out. After two years of begging he finally takes out the trash but only if he made chicken that day (and he hasn't learned how to put the trash can out for collection). Not maliciously, he's just clueless.\n\nAnd I admit at first I was happy to have him because I figured I could meet more people through him and what not. But nope that isn't happening. \n\nIf he leaves, I would have so much freedom that I constantly day dream about this. Like I could use his room as a game room! I could actually vacuum the whole house (I'm a neat freak... he hasn't washed the bathroom rug in the nearly 3 years he has been here - he also didn't how to use a vacuum cleaner). I could dance around naked the house! I can put up speakers everywhere and play all of my shitty songs! I won't have to check if he closed the front door!\n\nAnyway I've had some of my friends and mutual co-workers call me an asshole because I said I wanted to cancel his lease in the next two months (yes I plan on giving him like 50 day notice). They say I'm a lucky fuck for being able to find a good roommate (because he is) and others struggle finding a good roommate (and I agree - all of my roommates in college were nightmares). They say I'm spoiled for throwing away a source of income. They say I'm an asshole for making him find a another place in a tough market. \n\nI really keep dreaming about enjoying the house alone, but I fear they are right. Am I the asshole?",

She said she would pay her half of the rent for the remainder of our lease or until I found a new roommate because her boyfriend got rent paid for through military. I let her off the lease with that in mind. We're both full time students and part time employeed in small college town so naturally it's been rough to find a roommate (especially because my she moved out middle of October) after paying two months of her half of the rent she sends me a message completely unprompted to say that I'm a shitty friend for not having found a roommate yet. [Side note: she told me she was leaving on a specific day which she lied about because  I came home from work one day and she was just gone. She never said anything to me about it] and that she wasn't gonna give me anymore money for the rent because I've been given ample time to find one. I've now been put into a financial crisis because no one can move in due to their own leases not being up and I cannot handle the entire rent myself. Had to borrow money from my boyfriend which makes me feel shitty. So I sent her a message recently - even though we haven't talked since her message to me - and told her she wasn't a decent enough person to even think twice of the burden she put on me as well.

I was asking why it was important to do yoga today, and why not just go any other time in the week. I reminded her that if she brought lice back to the house it could spread to everyone else, and that we can’t exactly fly across the country with lice on our heads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe argued that she wants to go today.

She called me dramatic and said that I’m being controlling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the last thing I ever want to be in our relationship is controlling - she should never worry about me telling her where she can go or what she can do.

            "input": "Context -So I had a uni friend (let's call her Ani) and we were friends from the very first year. We clicked and totally hit it off. She was very nice, very sweet (Italian) and she was always friendly. We would constantly go out to pubs (this is happening in London), restaurants and out as a group for coffee. We were happy and close.\n\nSo this story happens in our final year about a month ago from this posting. The final year is a big year because we have our dissertations to do. During the summer we were allocated a supervisor and chose topics. Ani got a notoriously lazy and slow replying supervisor from whom she couldn't get a reply from. So she messaged another lecturer (Jane, who taught both of us last year) and asked her of she knows if her supervisor was alive. Jane replied that Ani should just chill out and relax and stop disturbing the supervisor till after summer. Ani was annoyed a lot by this and told me this story. \n\nFast forwarding to December - I was in our uni library on the ground floor researching some stuff and I got a text from Ani. We messaged and turns out she was on the second floor. I told her I'd meet up in 10 minutes. This is where I thought of doing the prank. \n\nI yped in Google - disguise my email and came to a website that could send pretend emails to people as if from another person. So I sent an email as if from Jane (the teacher that pussed Ani off) to Ani with this text:\n\n'Dear Ani, I thought long and hard about out conversation last summer. I spoke with your supervisor and as a sorry here is a document with some research materials and links you might find useful.'\nAttached was a word doc\nIn the document was a meme saying - you've been pranked LOL.\n\nSo I sent that off and then as a test I sent the same email to myself instead of Ani using the same website. The email was sent to junk and was blocked with the labels saying it was dangerous and malicious and that you had to give specific permission to open it. So I thought to myself that there is no point of telling Ani about the prank (which I had the full intention of doing because I was meeting her in 10 minutes) since the email was so blocked she wouldn't open it. \n\nThis. Is. Where. I. Ducked. Up\n\nA week later I forgot about the incident. Ani didn't say anything either so I thought she never got it. Because if I got an email like that my first reaction would be to message the group chat and say - 'lmao which one of you shi* heads sent this?'. A week later I get an email from the head of department saying that she needs to interview me about 'impersonation of a teacher and harassment of a student'. My heart collapsed.\n\nI message Ani out of panic and tell her the truth and apologise. I take it all on the chin. She tells me she was deeply hurt and traumatised and how I have no respect for her. I told her that's not true. We've been friends for so long. She tells me that she told the ENTIRE department about this and she was having another meeting with other lecturers. I told her:\n\n-I'll take any punishment that comes to me even if it is suspension\n\nAni- suspension? You're going to get expelled.\n\nAt this point I was shaking. In England you pay for uni but you do get loans to help. I am not an British citizen. So I pay double without the loan that my parents pay and they struggle to. I work part time to help out too. To have all of that swept away in one go was terrifying. That night I seriously thought of ending i because of the shame I brought to myself and my parents. Then I decided to write a defence for myself and prepared for the interview. \n\nWhen I came to the interview the head of the department was very formal and just asked for my side. I was very apologetic, telling her that :\nI did not intend to be malicious\nI had the full intention of telling her if my test email sent through.\nI had no vendetta against her or Jane.\nAni and I were best friends.\nIf I thought that what I was doing was so wrong and I had the intention of doing it anonymously to I wouldn't have been stupid enough to do it on the uni system in the uni library.\n\n(I'll post the resolution email from the head to me at the end if you want to read)\n\nThe head looked at the email, briefly smiled when she saw the meme and told me to wait for the judgment. A week later I was told that the case was dismissed and everything was fine and just not to repeat this again. Also the head told me that Ani asked her to tell me never to contact her again or come near her. Prior to this she had blocked me on all social media.\n\nSo am I the asshole here? Or was the joke taken too far? \n\nTL;DR - made a prank email disguised from a lecturer to a friend with a meme inside. She took it personally and tried to get me expelled. \n\nThe resolution email from the head of department to me -\n\nDear Mark,\n\n\nThank you for coming to speak to me and H on Thursday and for giving us your account of the incident described in my last email. I’ve now had a chance to speak to the student who received the spoof email, and I’m writing to let you know that on behalf of the department, I have decided that no further action needs to be taken. This is because this is your first violation of King’s IT policy, and the incident does not appear to be part of a pattern of harassment of other King’s students or staff. I have let IT know the outcome of this investigation, and asked them to unblock your KCL account by the end of the day today.\n\n\nI include here a brief summary of our discussion, for the record and so that D is aware of the details. Please let me know if you would like to make any amendments to this account.\n\n\nWhen we met, you admitted immediately that you had sent the spoof email. You said that you and the student who received the email were friends, and that you sent the email as a joke from a library computer right before you were due to meet up with her, expecting that you would have a chance to explain the joke right away. You said that you had sent her other joke messages in the past, although not through King’s email. You said that you had not previously sent spoof emails, and that you found instructions for doing so online before sending this email. When you sent yourself a test email, you realized that the email you sent to her had been quarantined, so you assumed that she would not see it; it was only when you spoke to her later after she had released the email that you realized the seriousness of what you had done. You said that you knew about the student’s earlier correspondence with J about her dissertation because the student had told you about it herself at the time. \n\n\nIn our meeting, you expressed remorse for sending the email, and said that you understood the gravity of the offence and would not repeat it. You said that you are not currently experiencing difficulties that are interfering with your studies or your wellbeing, apart from the ongoing responsibility of caring for your younger siblings.\n\n\nAs we discussed at the meeting, any further violations of King’s policy (IT or otherwise) will be treated as a second offence, and may jeopardize your degree. This incident has been logged with the Student Conduct office in case this happens, although if there are no further violations, this incident will not appear on your King’s record. I would add from my conversation with the student who received the email that she has been distressed by this incident, and would like you to refrain from contacting her. I ask you to please respect her wishes.\n\n\nThank you again for your cooperation with this investigation. I wish you the best for the remainder of your degree, and I encourage you to speak to D as your personal tutor if you find that you are encountering any difficulties at any point.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nA)\n",

I also have autism, which makes it harder for me to know what to do in social situations; it also means that I don't have very good spacial awareness and sometimes get caught in my own world, not very aware of anything going on outside of whatever I'm doing (in this case, reading). Having chosen to live with my mother and not my stepmom when I turned 18 (about 10 days ago), I've been doing much better with my anxiety, because my stepmom isn't around anymore. But this situation just set it off again.\n\nSo this morning I was taking the subway to my percussion ensemble rehearsal. I was sitting next to one of the doors and had put my backpack in front of me. There was another man across from me with a big cart in the aisle. A woman with a walker was sitting a few seats down from him.\n\nAbout fifteen or twenty minutes into the ride, I'm engrossed in my Stephen King book, and the woman gets up to get off. Her walker hits my backpack (I believe that was what happened), and some of her things fall off of it. I move back, trying to give her room but also thinking she has the situation under control.\n\nThen as she's getting off I hear her say something about how I'm a rude boy--- \"or girl, I can't even tell what you are---\" (I'm a trans girl but I look like a boy), \"you see a handicapped woman and you can't even move out of the way or help her.\"\n\nI look up, startled, and immediately try to make room for her, be courteous, but she picks up her things and goes on muttering to herself about me even after she's off the train. She never makes eye contact with me this whole time, by the way.\n\n I move my seat and begin hyperventilating/possibly having a panic attack, idk perhaps I was overreacting but one of my biggest anxiety triggers is messing up in public, especially with people I don't know. \n\nI just ... I don't know. There wasn't much room with the other guy's cart right there, and it did happen right in front of me, but sometimes I just ... there are situations where I don't think quickly enough. It also didn't seem as if I could have helped her pick the stuff up, with the angle we were at --- I think the walker was blocking it, I don't fricking remember the details.

I tell her and she’s obviously like “Fuck him we’ll do what we want” and that was the end of that. We talked to him occasionally, but only when we had no choice.

            "input": "Hey all.\n\nA week ago, my girlfriend and I hung out with two of her girl friends. We are all sixteen. \n\nWe spent the whole day together, playing mario kart, getting food, having a good time. I had to go home at midnight. but my girlfriend was talking about how her friend, (let’s call him D, for douchebag) was going to sneak into her house at 1. When she first talked about it, my whole mood changed.\n\nI trust my girlfriend with everything, but I do not trust D. Sure, we are all mutual friends, in fact, D is quite fond of me. The thing is, a month prior, me, D, my girlfriend, and two other friends were hanging out, and I repeatedly saw D staring at my girlfriends caboose. I told her about this, and she started defending him. She did the whole, “I’m not saying you’re wrong, but are you sure you really saw what you think you did?” Yeah, didn’t feel too good. \n\nA week prior to this, I had told her how her sneaking him into her house made me feel super uncomfortable. My argument was if she can’t sneak me into her house, she shouldn’t sneak another dude. She didn’t really fully listen to my argument, because she said “It’s just what WE DO, it’s what our friend group has always done!”\n\nSo, Saturday night comes around and they sneak D in. He brought a dab pen and a Juul. They hang out, and he left at 5. On the drive home, I damn near had a mental breakdown. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and knowing that D having a dab pen with my girlfriend and being a horn-dog was a recipe for disaster. Was the thought of that kid fucking around with my girlfriend plausible? Possibly. Was it my anxieties getting the best of me? Most likely, but regardless, I shouldn’t be put in that situation anyways.\n\nSunday morning comes around, and she could tell something was wrong because I didn’t talk to her once I got home, I just gave her a “goodnight” which I never do. \n\nI tell her the way she made me feel was the worst I had ever felt. The sole fact that she would sneak a dude that isn’t me into her house made me uncomfortable as it is, let alone\n\n1. He had weed with him (he had her hit the dab pen, this makes me mad at him, not her, in this case).\n2. If they got caught, she wouldn’t be able to hang out with me at least until 2019\n3. He’s a horn dog who I have seen staring at her ass\n4. If I ever snuck a girl with weed into my house, she would have a goddamn epiphany\n\nShe started by trying to defend D, saying “Oh it’s just what we do, and D is a very good friend of mine.”\n\nI kept detailing how shitty it made me feel, and she realized she fucked up. She began crying and profusely apologizing. She said she was sick with herself. I told her I didn’t mean to make her feel that way, but I was not okay with what she did and I needed to tell her. She cried more, and got off of her phone. We FaceTime later and talk about it for 4 hours. It was less of an argument, and more of a debate, because while this pissed me off monumentally I am pretty good at not starting an “argument”. \n\nShe eventually admits that she knows what she did was wrong, but she didn’t at the time. She then goes on to tell me that she doesn’t usually care what happens to her, and she always tries to put her friends first, because she hopes it will make her happier. I believe she may have been trying to guilt trip me? I don’t know, but I said “I’m sorry you feel that way, I really am, but the risk she took that night risked our entire relationship and that is not an okay risk to take. She keeps apologizing, and I keep saying that I accept her apology, but we will have a real problem if that happens again.\n\nSo here we are now. After many days of being angry with each other, we are back to normal and ready for Christmas. \n\nI still feel a little shaken up over it, and I never really got an apology for what she did, just for how it made me feel.\n\nI’m not going to push her about it anymore unless it happens again. It was our first big argument, and I don’t want that to happen again.\n\nTell me what you think.\n\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend sneaks a guy friend into her house in the dead of night against my wishes, I tell her how that made me feel, she starts self deprecating and making me feel bad, whilst also apologizing for the wrong thing, and we argue.

            "input": " \n\nTL;DR at bottom.\n\nProbably one of many similar posts - I know it's never possible to give full details, but I'll try. My family suffers from a range of mental challenges/conditions/illnesses: ADHD, Aspergers, depression, substance abuse, gender identity, anxiety. Although miraculously none of the uglier symptoms present themselves around friends or guests, they all come out in the wash during family holidays. This year, the parents rented a cottage in the middle of nowhere, so we will all be stuck together with no place to go.\n\nThis Thanksgiving has been a foretaste of what I fear will happen come Christmas. In just the last two days, I've been through enough mental illness crap to make me not want to come for Christmas. One sister had a two-hour violent meltdown over playing MineCraft (she's 11) that resulted in my father having to restrain her about six times. The other has ignored the houseguest from Japan she brought home from college (who, unfortunately, has had to witness all this going on), and freaked out during a board game: there was some confusion over a move that did not involve her: my family tends to get loud and talk over each other and that triggered her anxiety which resulted in her throwing a fit and her game pieces and storming out of the house. Just today I was yelled at for 'always looking for an argument': my mother announced her intention to shut off the internet for several hours to install a new router and I observed that I (and the Japanese exchange student) were working on online classwork. I'm typing this expecting the internet to shut off at any moment - I retreated to a closed room to avoid further conflict over the issue.\n\nI have tried to adopt the perspective that my role is to be a peacemaker as much as possible (e.g, acquiescing to simple demands, being a kind host to this poor Japanese girl and just talking to her). However, this Thanksgiving has made me feel that I am horrible in that role. I will admit that their behavior does not always bring out the best in me - I do not take well to my sister hitting and kicking my parents or the dog, for example. I am fully aware that some of this behavior is beyond my family's control; however, it is frustrating to see it under control around friends/guests, but receive the full brunt of it over political discussions, or even stupid things like games. Part of the reason I'm considering cancelling my Christmas ticket is so I won't end up becoming one of several assholes over Christmas.\n\nI fully anticipate that between the various diagnoses and differences on politics and religion that there will be several shitshows come Christmas. However, this holiday is the one time of year my entire family gets together. We will also have a bit of extended family joining us, too. If I don't show, it will be noticed and talked about, and break my parents' and grandparents' hearts. I've also had to pay nearly $1000 for Christmas travel, which I will only get about $600 back in the form of travel vouchers if I cancel. I have no idea what the alternative would be, as I don't have another family to 'adopt' me for the holidays (e.g., SO).\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for skipping family Christmas to avoid conflict aggravated by mental illness, knowing that it will hurt my family deeply if I don't come?",

Upon asking about it she said she liked to think of me and her as the people in porn she watched. No big deal there, they're actors or anonymous couples. She then continued to explain she also likes to visit sites like Omegle or ChatRoulette and pretend to be other people and talk to other people. Word for word she said \"it gets me horny, idk\". She explained that it's basically like porn, she's just using it to get off and since she's just having sexual talks with strangers and pretending to be someone else it's not bad. She also explained it's only at times I'm unavailable and that she \"thinks of me when she's talking to them\". I told her no, she shouldn't continue to do that, and that the difference is that she is interacting with another person, and whether she's pretending to be a different person or not she's still sexting someone else to get off. \n\nMy issue is that if she needs someone to sext or whatever she can just wait for me to get home from work and message or call me, and I explained this and how it amounts to emotional cheating, but she seemed kind of dejected by the whole thing. I also explained that I'm not super hurt or mad over it because I can see how she came to the conclusion that it's okay, but it's too weird and seems to easily escalatable for me to be comfortable with.\n\nSo my question is, am I the asshole for not approving of my GF's weird fetish when it's online, distanced from her actual self, and is with people she is incredibly unlikely to meet, with no video or other real info exchange.

            "input": "Okay, so this was a while back. I was out with a pal for a night on the town in a city in Central Europe and we were having a beer in sort of a bar/lounge/restaurant type space. We saw and approached two attractive women in their late 20's, one it turns out was an actress on a TV show (not famous, but whatever) and the other an artist. \n\nWe all had a flirty, fun convo with them for maybe 10-15 minutes. After everyone finished their respective drinks I asked them if they wanted to continue on together and join us for a cocktail at a place a few minutes away. They happily agreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe new place was quite crowded and it was hard to find a table to sit at. Once we find one, I have to head back to the bar to get drinks as there is no table service. I take everyone's order and pay for a round of cocktails, since its a pay as you guy type of system, and walk the tray of libations back to the table.\n\nAfter a few minutes of chatting,  both ladies casually mention that they have boyfriends that they live with. As any person knows, this sort of info is disappointing to hear after you've invested time into someone you are interested in, but life goes on. We continue conversing about this and that and the mood is generally pretty good, although the convo is losing a bit of luster as time goes on.\n\nI was just finishing my drink and they were about 3/4 through theirs, and they announce that they are going to go for a cigarette in a minute. I suggest that they order the next round on their way out from the bar to the street so the bartender can make the drinks while they smoke, and save everyone a few minutes of waiting. They look at each other and think it's a joke for some reason, and give a sassy, tongue in cheek answer of \"if you want a drink, you know how to do it.\"\n\nI smile, and ask again, \"yeah, but seriously, I'd love to get another one of these. It's your round, after all, and you are going right by the bartender.\" They seem dumbfounded by this and again look at each other like I'm crazy for asking.\n\n\"No, that's not how it works,\" they say again sort of devilishly smiling. \"Nice try though!\" They head out for their cigarette. My buddy also announces he has to pee, and heads off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I feel a bit like I've been taken advantage of. Call me crazy, but when I'm with friends, we will all take turns buying rounds. I'm happy to buy a gal a drink as part of the little ritual, but these two always had boyfriends. So they weren't going into it as part of the ritual, it was always a platonic type of situation for them in their minds. So why would they be exempt from buying a round after having one bought for them?  \n  \n\nThis is the AITA moment of truth. When they are outside I grab both their drinks and finish them. It's a rash decision, and one that obviously flaunts all norms of social courtesy, but in my mind it's acceptable and fitting. They broke the social code of offering to reciprocate, and in a fairly rude and dismissive manner. They seemed to have a level of entitlement that I didn't appreciate. And I had no interest in seeing them again. So fuck it, I'm going to drink the drinks I paid for.\n\nWhen they come back in and see that their glasses are only comprised of ice and a straw, the reaction is one of anger and disgust. They ask why I would do that and I tell them that I bought the drinks and they had no interest in buying the next round, so take it for what it is. A few choice words are thrown my way and they grab their stuff and hastily leave. \n\nMy buddy, just back from the toilet, watches all this unfold and has no idea what has happened. When I explain to him he thinks it's all crazy, but laughs, and we continue on.   \n\n\nSo yeah, I think there is some asshole behavior on my part, but it only came out as a response to what I saw as assholish behavior. AI*T*A?   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

To bring up my past and talk disrespectfully about me to family friends, people whom I visit and talk to, is just borderline unforgivable.  \n\n\nHer body language and attitude was just...blah. \"You recorded me and that is just unbelievable! \". Forget all the things she said. Or that she told lies about me to our family friends. I cried a little when I told her how upset I was. I told her I didn't think she was inherently a bad person. I told her that I love her very much. But I don't want her around me or my family anymore (my wife and son). She just said \"Okay then\". No real emotion. Just like whatever. I feel like she is trying to play the victim. Like I was the one pushing her away by telling her to stay away from my family because of her toxic behaviour and not her behaviour. She has done this before (speak to family friends about me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're wondering what she says about me it is things like talking about bad things I did years ago, calling me names, lying about things I've said/done or even what my intentions are. Just some really awful things She did not seem remorseful although she did shed a few tears (literally). Probably because I cried a little (I don't cry often) and she was moved and it probably made her shed a tear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I would like to know is, AITA for recording them and finding out what they have been saying about me?\n\nWas it like, I shouldn't really be spying on them but holy crap they have been saying some really nasty things about me so the recording is justified?\n\nOr was it like, you're an ass for recording them. You deserve to find out horrible things family may say about you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

I went through her recently deleted and unfortunately saw a pic of her in her underwear. \n\nI confronted the family friend on WhatsApp before telling my mom first, and basically told him to fuck off and don’t text my mom.

They both kept on denying it. She kept on saying why would I cheat now in my 50s (mind you my dad is outside the country). \n\nNow I’m really stuck in crossroads. Is she actually cheating?

As my wife and I were walking to the restaurant an older Chinese man looked in shock, pointed at my daughter and then at me. He told me “That baby needs more clothes!” I responded that she’s fine. She was actually in 3 layers: a body suit, a cardigan and a fleece onesie. I live in the Bay Area, so it was maybe mid 50’s. I stood near the doorway trying to look to see where my parents were sitting, when the old guy came up to me and said, “She is not fine, she’s too cold.

My first ever relationship, which stretched for seven months (probably far too long), had recently ended, and I wasn't taking it as well as I'd have liked. I had a hard time facing and spending time with my ex, and pretty much went into radio silence with both her and our group of mutual friends. One such friend had known me since sixth grade, and to this day I still don't blame him for how things ended up happening and still call him one of my best friends.\n\nSo basically, this friend, I'll call him Jay, and I ended up sharing a class together... I think it was Chemistry? Well, somewhere along the line, my ex, who I'll call Dee, ended up dating him. He actually told me he'd had feelings for her since middle school, when I'd hardly known her at all (we met in Sophomore year). Due to her schedule of taking college classes and high school classes, she'd have several \"Filler\" periods at school where she was free to go anywhere she pleased within the school. \n\nShe chose to visit Jay, and would often sit with him, talk to him, simple things like that. They were obviously never physically intimate in class, no kissing or even really holding hands, but her presence there always just... bothered me. To put it to words, I guess it felt like hammering in the fact that I had failed to keep her interest, the fact that I hadn't made enough of an effort to spend more time with her. I think I was comparing how our relationship had been with her current relationship with Jay. We were... lukewarm, only saw each other for sparse dates, often without very good conversation, and exactly zero physical intimacy. Yet here they were, able to make time and talk to each other fluidly and easily. I'd even seen them in the common area once when they both had a free period, just talking and holding each other.\n\nSo after a while of this, I decided to take things into my own hands. After class I pulled the teacher aside and asked him to keep Dee from visiting the class again. I didn't want him to tell her that I was the one who requested it, but I feel like she knew anyways. Thinking about it now I feel so petty about having done that, like I should have just let it roll over my shoulders. I let my jealousy and low self-esteem get in the way of her happiness.\n\nI don't know how aware she was about how I felt about her and Jay's relationship, and I never outwardly told her. I sort of made up and broke radio silence near the end of senior year, but it was never the same, and I haven't spoken with her once since graduation. She and Jay ended up splitting up, and I have spoken to Jay since, even visited him when I was back home.",

Whether it be because she hangs out with her a lot or how my roommates hate her, her BFF always come up.   \nThis time I was on the phone with my girlfriend while a different friend was in the background. I don't remember how, but the conversation turned into why are you so obsessed with my BFF? do you like her? do you want to sleep with her? why do you think about her all the time? and not in the kind of way where you feel like they are asking genuinely but she was asking on the attack being pissed off thinking I actually do care about her BFF in some sort of sexual way.

You know normal stuff for when you get a job. \n\n\nWhen I ended up getting the job my first day of work was just me bagging up the food and handing it out to the people in the dining area. After my first week I started working morning on the weekends and that’s where I met creepo. When he first saw me he was like “so you’re ________.” And I said “yeah this is my first time ever having a job” and he went in for a high five and said “Wow that’s amazing!” When I gave him a high five he kinda held my hand for a minute.  Kinda weird but didn’t think much about it. \n\n\nFast forward to a few weeks working the morning shifts and he decided to move me to drive thru where I take the orders and give the food to the customers. It’s probably my most favorite position. But its always just him and I alone until 11 which gives him at least 4 hours alone with me. This is when he starts to act weirder. \n\n\nI would be taking an order and he’ll come up behind me and start playing with my hair and saying “Look at you working hard.” In the most uncomfortable sexual voice.

Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment.

We met in senior year but fell out of contact and reestablish contact around April 2018. And he and I start hanging out all the time. Now I don’t have a car at that point so he comes to pick me up and we do fun things. Now he was a larger guy, not super overweight but big enough he was unhappy and had self confidence issues/body image issues. So I encouraged him to start eating better and invited him to come work out with me and he started dropping pounds like nobody’s business. He was feeling good about himself. I even helped him get a job.  I literally changed his life for the better. He was even friends with my dad. We told each other everything, he was my best friend and I even saw him as an older brother.  So for that reason plus the fact that he just wasn’t the type of guy I’m looking for I wouldn’t date him (despite all of our other friends saying oh you guys would be cute together and all this is the man you married and all this other stuff they gave him false hope), so for those reasons I suppose he held out hope. I figured (hoped)  It would  pass. Nope. Wrong. Now we tell each other everything he brought me all his problems, which is fine I don’t mind listening and I’ve been told I give pretty good advice, but he kept bringing me the same problem, that all he wanted was a girlfriend. He brought this problem to me twice a week if not more. It was beginning to become a strain on our friendship. My best friend and I helped him set up a tinder, he hadn’t matched with very many girls yet, he also kept thinking he could get girls that where on my level of attractiveness, big boobs, with a nice ass. (Y’all will probably crucify me for that but it’s the truth, unless he finds some 10 with daddy issues) But I digress, I finally just couldn’t take it anymore I had told him for months he needed to go to therapy (I did it in subtle ways I brought it up talked about my time in therapy as a child and how it helped me. But he seemed very unreceptive to it so I didn’t push the issue), he’s a messed up dude his family did it to him, and being overweight most of his life definitely didn’t help. And so I was like look you need to go to therapy, I even offered to go with him and help him fill out the forms and take him to a good place. After two long hours of tears and things he finally agreed. So I went with him signed him up and finally things started to get better and go his way. He was getting the help he needed and he got a very promising match on tinder. (As a matter fact he’s with that girl right now) but he was still madly in love with me. So his therapist said “you need to cut her out of your life. So that you can move on.” He was very upset about it. But he did it. And I understood, but now I’m a little resentful of the fact that he kicked me out of his life. ",

I probably missed a few, too.\n\nFor some reason I just can't conjure up any positive feelings for her; I care about my stepmom and I know for a fact that she cares about me but almost everything she does seems to stress me out; nothing seems to be good enough for her when I clean the house with my sister, and she loses her temper incredibly easily with us. If we ever say anything that contradicts her, she raises her voice at us for arguing with her, and tells us that we never do anything she tells us to; that maybe she should just become harder on us if we're going to be like that. She just lashes out in anger and rarely tries to make up afterwards, even going as far as to say that it's our fault for pissing her off and being so uncooperative in the first place. And any perceived sign of disrespect (real or not) at all is immediately pointed out and I'm scolded for it. Recently, when I revealed that I feel safer talking with my biological mother (who has a history of drug abuse and is very financially unstable, on top of the fact that she use to stand us up during visitation. Still, I feel like I can talk to her and trust her more) , she launched into this huge, night-long lecture about how ungrateful I am for the work she puts into us, and how she loves us more than that woman ever could, and that if I wanted to be with our biological mom so badly then why don't we try and live with her. Any little thing can piss her off, and she launches into a lecture about how I need to have good grades so I don't end up in my parent's basement like my biological mom did, or worse. One time, she started to yell at my sister who was hyperventilating and obviously having an anxiety attack from already being chewed out for her grades. Occasionally, my stepmom changes up rules when they've always been a certain way, and pretends like it's always been like that. Because of her temper and different way of thinking, I never feel like I could share my inner thoughts around her; they always get targeted as some form of disrespect or they get shrugged off as childish. Both of my parents never seem to take me seriously, and treat me like I know nothing. My stepmom is also incredibly passive aggressive to everybody in the house; even my dad. I'm honestly just afraid of her; she never seems to be able to control her feelings and I can't relax while she's in the house because she'll probably find something to get stressed about.\n\nI'm not even a bad kid; I try my hardest in school and I really try to make my parents happy because I care about them. I used to love my stepmom but for some reason that feeling's just faded entirely into an urge to get the hell out of this house.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

During the second year of friendship Jane met “JOHN” whom she got pregnant to, got engaged too and now they are getting married next week. We ended up having babies about a month apart which brought us back to chatting and being friends.\n\nThe old Jane (1+ yrs ago) used to ask me to do things for her CONSTANTLY. Basically at the time the friendship was her using me to look after he animals all the time at her home she was “renovating”, while she was off in another town with John, going to parties etc. I stopped all contact with her and basically ended the friendship. She reached out to me 3 months ago after seeing I had given birth to my son just a month after she had given birth to her own. I was happy to give it another go, thinking things might be different since shes become a mother.\n\nOk so...\n\nJane about three days before her Hens party invited me when to tag along. She had organized go karting, drinks and dinner. I said I might be able to go depending on my 3 month old son. \n\nJane said she was just going to drink and still breastfeed her 4 month old and that “if you’re ok to drive then you’re ok to feed”. \n\nThe day before said Hens, she asked me if I was coming and I said no. I truthfully said my son was cluster feeding and that I was unable to pump enough milk to go out and drink/to be away from him for hours.\n\nJane bombarded me with messages saying the following;\n\n- come out but don’t drink\n- i’ll give you some of my breastmilk\n- just bring him along\n- just at least call in then (venue is an hour away from me)\n\nI was so overwhelmed that I said I would pump and see how I got on and MIGHT call in but that I also might not. \n\nNeedless to say I didn’t get on very well with pumping and decided to stay home. I didn’t feel safe taking my baby out to a pub/club and being around heavily intoxicated people, so I didn’t want to “just call in” either. Secondly I just feel that my partying days have passed and I’m not into getting wasted anymore. \n\nSo day of hens party I got sidetracked when family came to visit, house work, grocery shopping, baby stuff etc that when she messaged me the place they were going to for drinks and dinner, I didn’t end up messaging her back. \n\nToday was the day after the hens party and I woke up, saw the message again and thought oh i will ask her out to lunch at this nice place to make up for me not going and that it would be more suitable as i can bring baby and she can bring her baby too.\n\nJane asked me to call and then she rang and she proceeded to say she doesn’t think the friendships working out, why didn’t I respond or turn up, doesn’t think we should be friends anymore etc etc. I explained that my baby’s needs come first and I couldn’t go and that I had said that to her and she still insisted I turn up, etc but she ended up just hanging up mid phone call and blocking me on all social media (her partner also blocked me too).",

I worked there for a total of 5 months and during my time there we underwent significant changes in leadership and staff, so most of the people I worked with had quit or been fired by my third month there including several managers and the general manager that hired me. As a result I was switched to a completely different shift and had to work with a bunch of trainees and new employees. \nOne of the major changes made at the restaurant was the opening of a new position called the cleaning captain. His job was basically just to keep the restaurant clean. He had worked under the new GM for around 2 years at a different restaurant franchise (very important detail), so she recruited him to work at our store. \nInitially I had no problems working with the guy, his position alleviated a lot of my responsibilities, so I was given other tasks. Because I had already been trained on the proper ways to do some of these tasks by the District manager (who supervised the store during the management change for about a month, and changed up the protocols for a lot of things) I offered to help him learn the right ways to do things like cleaning windows and bathrooms (which the DM was very strict about). \n\n*I chose to help him because i saw that he wasn't receiving proper training, and was basically being thrown in the pool and told to swim by the new GM, who was a rookie herself.*\n\nSo, after i showed him how to do them properly a few weeks later i noticed that he would slack on doing them (they were supposed to be done every morning) and I would remind him to do them, so he doesn't get chewed out by the GM. I personally would want someone to do that for me, but he started to take it as me bullying him (this is important). So, i stopped reminding him unless I needed to. \n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and we're short staffed because the morning shift manager quit, the morning cashier was fired along with the morning fryer. So, i was put into the position as the opening shift cashier and prep. He was also forced to take on two postions as the cleaning captain and prep helper. \n\nSo, up until then we remained cordial and we would joke around along with the new morning manager and the fry cook. The three of them were way older than me. I'm 18, the morning manager was 37, the fry cook was 27, and the cleaning captain was 38. We would toss around insults and jokes, and they would complain about their struggles in life. \nI would avoid talking about the heavy stuff and  would join in on the jokes, but every time I would join in he'd act like it was a big problem and make it seem like I was picking on him. The only time that i actually picked on him was when I joked about how dumb it looked when he kept the cardboard in his hat.  Other than that I only ever added on to group banter and it was never one sided. \n\nWhen we worked he still insisted that i was picking on him if showed him the proper way to do things , or if I asked him to help me with something. A lot of the stuff being asked of him was outside of his position, but it wasnt me asking him to do it. I  only tried to show him how to get things done more effectively, but he would still whine and complain about me picking on him. I have a low tolerance for whiners and I refuse to be antagonized, so I would defend myself. It got to the point where every time i said anything to him he would make it an arguement.  \n\nI'll admit that I'm not the most sensitive or patient person, so I  tried to explain to him that I'm not trying to pick on him. I was only trying to do my job and help him with his because when he messed up or took too long doing something it would throw off my work and would add to my work load.\nHe didn't take that well and would call me a disrespectful little girl. I don't understand how I  was being disrespectful, or why he felt like he deserved to be treared better because of his age. \n\nAbout a week or so later the confrontation got worse. He would purposely be in my way to irritate me, he constantly accused me of purposely making messes that he had to clean, and he would snap on me if I tried to get him to do his job more effectively and stop making me work harder than neccessary. \nAt some point he started talking trash about me to other coworkers and trying to ruin my image, refusing to help me with things like lifting boxes that were too heavy for me and getting supplies during the lunch rush, and he once told me that he wished his daughter (who died about 6 years ago and was 5 or so years older than me) was still alive so she could beat me up. \n\nThe final straw came when he out right yelled at me because I tried to show him how to fry something faster after waiting on him to get done for almost 20 minutes, so I could do what i had to do before the lunch rush started (I was the only cashier and I also fried chips and stuff, but I couldn't do both during the rush). Later that same day he yelled at me for telling him that he needed to hurry and leave the kitchen instead of lollygagging trying to steal food out of uniform after his shift, because the DM was on her way and would fire him and yell at all of us if she saw him like that. \n\nAfter this incident, I talked to my parents about it and they told me that tbe best thing to do was to go to the GM about it or her boss. I would have gone to the manager that was over our shift first, but she saw everything as it happened and even after I showed clear signs of distress and I told her it bothered me, she never did anything to resolve the issue. She always laughed it of and I found out later that she assumed that we had known each other for a long time and were playing (even though I clearly told her that the way he treated me bothered me). \n\nSo, I told the GM and she got defensive and accused me of being bossy and took his side because she knew him longer and \"he wasn't know for acting like this\". She completely dismissed everything I said, and her solution to the problem was to just have us ignore each other. EVEN THOUGH HIS JOB DIRECTLY AFFECTED MINE. \n\nThe next week my hours were immediately cut in half and i was given fewer days to work, while his never changed. Her excuse when I quit, because it's a waste of time to work 3 hours and day for 2 days a week, as that we weren't bring in enough money and they had to decrease hours. That were BS, because there were part timers with more hours than me. \n\nTL;DR: I was accused of bullying because I wanted to help a newer employee be more efficient. \n\n\n",

            "input": "TL;DR: I have done a ridiculous amount of research into things my brother's boyfriend has told me and my brother and have not found a single thing to be true. My brother is clueless. I've breached some trust here and fallen down a bit of a rabbit hole, AITA? And can I confront my brother about this asshole without him hating me?\n\nSorry for how long this is but this is some Dirty John shit and it needs some explaining. My \\[24F\\] brother David \\[27M\\] has been dating Kyle \\[29M\\] for about six months and immediately I thought something was off about him. Despite only being 27 (later found out his actual age is \\~29) he claimed he was a VP at a MAJOR company and that this company flew him places in private chartered jets and gave him a beautiful, giant apartment in a downtown area. This was despite him constantly (during working hours!) being at my brother's apartment, and my brother never once sending me a Snapchat or any other picture from them hanging out at his place. Early on in their relationship David actually confronted him about how he felt it was weird he'd never been to his apartment, and Kyle fed him some shit about how he just didn't feel \"emotionally connected\" to the apartment because he was going to be quitting his job at MAJOR company soon to pursue a law degree. And David bought that for some reason! After I pointed out that it still didn't seem right, David would get hostile or outright change the subject when I would bring it up. \n\nFast forward to Christmas where David asked us if he could bring Kyle home to my parents house as a show of support from us about his new relationship. I still had my reservations about him, but I went in with an open mind. The week was an absolute nightmare. He was incredibly negative and outright rude to me and my parents but David didn't seem to notice at all. But that isn't the point of this post. What he also did the whole weekend is just make up some insane fucking lies that while I could not immediately debunk in the moment, I have since debunked. Here are the best:\n\n* **He claims to have played basketball at a very well known college for basketball.** I'm talking Elite Eight well known. I debunked this before we even met him with a look at their readily available online roster from the year he claimed to play.\n* **He claims to have received a full ride scholarship, despite only playing for one year and was allowed to keep the full ride scholarship after he quit playing.** No injury involved, he just \"wasn't feeling it.\" I asked my boyfriend's brother who plays college sports on scholarship if this is something he had ever heard of, and he laughed in my face and said no. \n* **He claims to have attended an elite school (not Ivy but one of the best in the country) and graduated with a BS and a Master's with NO DEBT.** (he later mocked me and my brother for having student loans, so charming.) I debunked this by finding the commencement list online from the years he could have graduated. This one has room for error, because people can be left off a program, but still. \n* **Once again, claimed to be a VP at a Major Company.** I asked my boyfriend's dad, who is a VP at a smaller company, if that were possible and if any of the perks he described were possible, and he said no. \n* **He claimed to have a pilot's license.** This was a big ol' fuckup because my dad works for the FAA and he checked the database and he ain't on it. \n* **He claimed to have been accepted to Yale Law school with the option to defer for five years.** I talked to my best friend who is currently in law school whether she'd ever heard of a five year deferment, and she said someone in his family had to be dying for him to even get a one year deferment. And it's still rare. \n\nThese are the greatest hits and the best stuff I have to go off of. Aside from this stuff, he's incredibly manipulative and possessive. I talked to one of his friends (Amanda) and she said she hadn't seen David in like a month because Kyle doesn't like her and insults her constantly. (She has been debunking his lies for a long time.) At the moment, David is away in Africa on his dream vacation for another week. He has left his apartment keys, his car keys and his dog to Kyle to watch. Kyle told David before he left that he would keep the dog at \"his place\" (which I don't think exists) and just keep his keys for safe keeping. But while he's been gone, Amanda and her husband have walked by her home every other night while walking their dog and saw Kyle inside on the couch. My dad and mom were going to be in the city for a conference and asked if they could stay at David's apartment instead of a hotel, and Kyle said he wasn't in town to give them the keys. Sure enough they show up at David's apartment and Kyle isn't there but David's car is gone too. After he told David he wouldn't be using it. \n\nSo finally we get to the asshole part: this is a LOT of digging. On top of the above stuff, I've looked up criminal records, talked to all David's friends (they hate Kyle too FWIW,) asked a friend to use his Lexus Nexus access to look him up, and have done a lot lot lot of stuff behind his back to prove this guy is not who he says he is. We're very close to hiring a private investigator. I've trespassed on a lot of trust here. I feel like I've crossed a line. But I just want to be absolutely sure that if I ever confront David about him, Kyle can't talk his way out of it. But can I even confront him at this point without displaying this huge breach of trust I've done? Have I crossed a line into asshole territory or am I still just being protective? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

When I told him about it at home he said that nothing is going on and that she just ‘wanted to clarify one thing’ and that they talk but it’s never inappropriate.

However, he is still a pretty good person.\n\nI am not strong and I don’t know what would happen if I was in a threatening physical situation. I was also raised near NYC. My father was a police officer and has always told me that, for my own safety, I should never engage with anyone on the street. You never know what might happen. Last year, I was in a situation with my male friend and my boyfriend that involved a homeless person approaching us and targeting me. He started cursing at me and the situation could have gotten physical had my boyfriend not driven away. After we were safe, I told them that this is why we should not engage with homeless people. I get that not all of them are dangerous, but I do not want to be involved as I am scared of what might happen. My boyfriend agreed with me and respects my wishes. My friend, however, laughed and said that he’s going to do whatever he wants if I’m there or not.\n\nFlash forward a few months. Said friend and I go on a class trip to a city in Europe. While we are there, he insists on engaging with every single homeless person he meets. He even goes to ATMs to withdraw money, exchanges information with them, and does whatever they ask. I told him that this made me uncomfortable, and he told me that I should just keep walking by myself if I didn’t want to do that with him.\n\nI told him that I’m concerned for his safety as well as my own; we’re in a foreign country and we have no means of defending ourselves. It’s one thing if we’re home, but this doesn’t seem safe. He claims that he can defend himself and that it’s his duty as a Christian to give to every homeless person. He claims that he has never had a bad experience, so nothing could happen with these people. He also implied that I am not a good Christian because of this. It got so bad that one of the people he gave money to saw him on a street again, called him out by his first name, and asked for even more.\n\nI am not against helping the homeless, but you can’t know what might happen.

He was really secretive and wouldn’t tell me who it was.\n\nThat same friend who told the guy to confess told me it was really obvious who his crush was and was surprised I didn’t get it. \n\nEventually though from all the teasing from me and the way everyone acted around me and him, I got the message. And I was nervous because I didn’t reciprocate those feelings.\n\nBut then time came and he wanted to talk to me by the school halls during lunch and he wanted to talk with me by the window. I become confused but do it anyways, only to find him confessing to me.\n\nPanicking because I, again, didn’t like him that way, I go ahead and say “I’m flattered, thanks” and smiled. It was really awkward and I broke the silence and asked “So what do you want me to say” and he just says it’s fine and offers me an Oreo but I say I’m on a diet because he confessed a day before prom.\n\nI got reprimanded by another friend for not giving him a chance and not liking him back. I argued that I can’t force feelings that aren’t there and that at least I didn’t lead him on or anything. We both agreed to disagree and ended it at that.\n\nDays later of everyone forcing me to dance with him during half my prom night even if I was unhappy, people teasing me with him and flirting with me for him, I thought it was repulsive but I did nothing. \n\nNow I can’t even talk normally to him as a friend because he either tries to flirt with me or guilt trips me for what I said and repeats it in our conversations and it’s annoying. \n\nI no longer feel like wanting to hang around with him because of that but I can’t help but forget we had a good friendship before this and I feel bad wanting to ignore it over this.\n\nHonestly, the guilt tripping is kind of working and I keep wondering lately if I should have just toughened up and pretended to like him back.

She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don’t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work.

I agree with the sentiment but simply can’t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I.

We were the first ones to put our names down for the apartment and up until mid summer we were the only ones listed in the apartment.  Well room assignments came around and two random roommates were also assigned to the apartment.  This was no big deal and was something we both saw coming as it was pretty unrealistic to get an apartment all to ourselves.\n\nAnyway, after moving into the apartment Saturday morning things were strange.  I didn't see my first random roommate (we'll call him Mat) until nine at night since he was staying in his room with the door closed.  My second random roommate (let's call him Tim) didn't move in until late Sunday night and made quite a commotion doing so.  The next morning, I saw Mat in the kitchen and we introduced ourselves.  The basics like what our major was, our year, where we're from, etc. in general he's a pretty decent guy and I don't have any problems with him.\n\nTim on the other hand...\n\nI didn't see Tim until Wednesday night when I was in the kitchen waiting for water to boil.  He came up the stairs and I said something along the lines of \"hey how's it going\" and he walked right past me.  No wave.  No eye contact.  Nothing.  He walked straight past me and into his room.  Off to a great start.\n\nI saw him again the next day and tried to start a conversation.  I managed to get a small wave out of him as he passed by but that was it.  \n\nThis continued on for weeks until Mat, my friend, and I had to almost drag him out of his room to fill out our roommate agreement.  During this ,we all agreed to keep the apartment clean, take out the trash as it fills, and just generally be respectful of one another.  Well the three of us did, Tim did little more than sit there quietly.\n\nTo no ones surprise Tim didn't keep up his end of things.  He has a popcorn maker and there are constantly kernels left all over the floor and the trash can will overflow with his microwave meal packages.  On top of all of this Tim gets really into his video games.  And I mean **REALLY** into them.  He stays up late swearing his head off and dropping every racial slur under the sun at these games.\n\nSome of my favorite quotes of his include (if you're easily offended don't click the spoilers)\n\n\"&gt;!Get raped you fucking nigger!&lt;\"\n\n\"&gt;!I can barely understand you go back to your own country spic!&lt;\"\n\n\"&gt;!Don't talk to me you fucking dipshit!&lt;\"\n\nand the list continues\n\nThis finally prompted the three of us to talk to our RA and have a mediation to try and get things worked out with him.  The mediation wasn't very productive but Tim told us he'd do better.\n\nShockingly nothing changed.  Food was still being left on the floor.  He was still stuffing his trash into an already filled trashcan rather than taking it out.  And his choices in language and volume level didn't change.\n\nAbout a month later we go to the housing office to attempt to get something done.  The housing office organizes a SECOND mediation with our RA and our housing coordinator.  This mediation went a bit better and a chore chart was organized to make sure everything gets done.\n\nThings have been relatively stagnant since then, he still yells at his video games but the apartment stays clean.  There's still almost no communication and trying to talk to him feels like cornering a wild animal.  \n\nWell last week I came out of the bathroom to see Tim standing there waiting for me.  He said something along the lines of \"hey... would you and \\[friend's name\\] want to get pizza sometime?\" I told him I'd have to talk to my friend but maybe.\n\nI have no intention of getting pizza with this guy.  He's ignored every attempt at communication and friendship for months now and has been outright disrespectful at times.  I appreciate him finally reaching out but for me it's too late.  So am I the asshole for not wanting to be friends with my roommate after months of him blatantly disrespecting and ignoring me?\n\nTL:DR One of my four college roommates has refused to talk to anyone in the apartment for months now.  He's disrespectful, messy, and yells racial slurs at his video games and is just not the kind of person I want to associate with.  He finally asked my friend and I if we'd want to grab food sometime but I feel like it's too little too late after living together for four months and having no communication.\n\nAlso thank you to anyone who read this novel of a post, this is me trying to summarize four months of hell.

The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don’t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend’s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I’d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour’s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can’t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that’s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I’d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn’t care about the kids, I’m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.

For the most part they were little things a few times a day, winking or sticking their tongue out at me when things said could be taken \"sexually\".

It was at a point where several of our mutual friends believed they were interested in me. Until after a month of it they somewhat abruptly declared that they is not interested in me or anyone else in the friend group and would never date any of us. Unknown to them I did have a crush on them before the flirting started, but I would rather keep a friend than risk losing it over that.\n\nFor the next few days I spent very little time with friends. I had a big homework assignment to do so they felt like I was avoiding them, which I kind of was. I needed time alone to get over the \"broken heart\". Afterward we talked a little and they voiced how their flirting meant absolutely nothing and they were not interested in me at all.\n\nNow things are awkward between us and we are no longer as good of friends as we used to be. they claims that since then I am sometimes hostile towards them.

Fred will shave and leave a ton of hairs all around the sink. He will use my bathroom stuff and I'm a woman. He refuses to clean. He's never once cleaned the bathroom, living room, or any other place. He smells like BO and leaves weed and ash and roaches everywhere. Instead of taking the garbage out, he will stack trash and leave us to take care of it. \n\nThe last straw was when he got sick from what I'm pretty sure was norovirus (aka stomach flu). I was in the living room yesterday morning and he was on the couch.  He gets up, stumbles through the hallway and throws up all over the floor. I immediately think \"uhoh\". \n\nI tell him to try and stay away from the living room so we don't get sick. He doesn't listen and hangs out in the living room. He cleans his mess but left his trash outside near the front door in a plastic bag. I told him to leave my dog alone and not pet him. He didn't listen, so now I can't cuddle my dog. He's also not washing his hands. \n\nSo I'm in the bathroom with bleach, gloves and a mask desanitizing everything (which I get, because he wasn't in a condition to clean). I've done EVERYTHING I can to stay away from him. I am not eating in the house, not anything. I threw away my toothbrush just in case particles got on there while he was puking his guts out. \n\nI came back from class today and put on my mask. He irritatingly says I don't need it as if I am overreacting. He says it was \"food poisoning\" and to not worry. If he knew anything, norovirus can be food poisoning and that's incredibly contagious. He's getting irritated with me and tells me I act like his mom because I tell him to clean. If I get sick I am not going to let him live this down.  \n\nAnd I'll probably move out. I know norovirus is really contagious and even the most clean of people get it, but if I get sick from HIM I think I'll be too disgusted with him to look at him. Just imagining him stumbling into the hallway with heavy feet and puking all over the floor like a child makes me sick. If I get sick I know I'm going to really go off on him. \n\nAnd I mean yell. I won't be able to control it and I'm going to blow up. I need to know if this makes me an asshole. I can't take it anymore.

I don't know *what* the hell they're doing, but there is consistent, non-stop, aggravating \"tap-tap-tap, taptaptaptap, tap-tap-tap, taptaptaptap\". It'll go on for hours.

She decided to move in with me after graduation with the goal of also preparing to apply for [rigorous graduate degree program] at some point. It is also important to know that the house we would both be living in was purchased as an investment property by our parents (we're very fortunate for all they're able/willing to do for us). We would also be living with a roommate who was one of my classmates, as well as my cat. Finally, it is important to note that while my sister is not a complete train wreck of a human, she is certainly not known for being the most responsible or tidy. \n\nSo right after my sister graduated, she was living at home with my parents for a few months while she prepared to move down to where I was living. During this time she decided that she wanted to get a pet mini pig after meeting a friend's and falling in love. I immediately gave my parents numerous reasons why that was a bad idea:\n1. pigs are notorious for being too smart for their own good, i.e. you might have to end up baby proofing your house if you have one\n2. no one had any reason to think that my sister was responsible enough to handle a pet pig, and since she planned on moving in with me, the pig would then become my responsibility, which I didn't find fair, especially considering what was going on in my life at the time\n3. even though I'm her sister and my parents were our landlords, we also had a paying tenant, who nobody thought to get permission from. In my experience during college, pets were only allowed if all of the roommates consented, and I thought that was still important in this instance. \n4. We didn't know how a pig would potentially get along with my cat, who I had had for over 3 years at that point \n5. My sister was in an inherently transitional point in her life at the time, and was not able to predict where she would likely be in 1, 3, or 5 years, and therefore it seemed irresponsible to get a pet that would likely be very difficult to bring along with her while she figured out her life. \n\nDespite all of these points, my parents insisted that my sister be allowed to \"make her own mistakes\". I pointed out that this was ridiculous, because my sister had no money and my parents were planning on bankrolling this \"mistake\", but that too fell on deaf ears. So, ultimately my sister gets what she wants, a little baby mini pig.\n\nI have to say, the pig was actually adorable and sweet. She got along with my parent's cats and dog well, and was really not too much trouble like I had predicted. HOWEVER it was still not sustainable for a few reasons:\n1. pigs can be litter box trained, but you cannot use kitty litter, because they are pigs, and therefore will eat it, and which point it will clump up in their stomach and they could die. Therefore they had to use sawdust, which does fuck all to mask the potent odor of pig waste, and needs to be completely changed out daily. \n2. the pig absolutely refused to walk on asphalt or anything that wasn't smooth. Because of this, her hooves began to grow out of control, and taking her to a vet was not really a viable option due to...\n3. her size. She didn't stay \"mini\" for long. I don't have a final weight, but just know in the short time my family had her, she got pretty freaking big\n\nSo as to the resolution for the story, which I suppose isn't as sad as I might have predicted, my sister ended up moving in with me sans pet pig. This was because, as I said from the beginning, the pig was too much work and responsibility for her. This meant my parents (AKA my mom) were now responsible for her. However, due to the overgrown hoof issue, which to my mom's credit, she did try to work on to no avail, they ultimately had to surrender the pig to a farm, which conveniently backs up to their backyard. However she did not stay there permanently, and was eventually moved to some other farm in the area. According to my mom, we would be welcome to visit her whenever we like, but no one has. I don't know what the future holds for this pig though. Will she die of old age on a farm? I find that unlikely, but who knows. \n\nAs for anyone who might be wondering why my parents ever even entertained this idea, I'm still pretty confused about it too, but I think part of it is that my parents have always considered my little sister very sensitive, which is not untrue, however because of this, they tend to treat her with kid gloves. I personally think this has only made the problem worse and kind of stunted her maturity. I would like to note however that I love my sister very much and despite our differences I have considered her my best friend throughout all of this. \n\nAnyways, thanks to anyone who read all of this!

Understandably, it's difficult trying to coordinate the schedules of a bunch of busy people, but I feel like I've reached my wit's end with the bi-weekly string of text messages and emails with new proposed dates because someone can't make it, or a restaurant is booked, or whatever.  It's gotten to the point that she's throwing around dates in March and April, and this coordination has been going on since October.\n\nI really just want to be able to say \"No, I'm not interested in having dinner with you at an expensive restaurant an hour from my home on a date certain two months from now.\"  But I can't because we send each other business somewhat regularly, and we've done work for each other's businesses too.\n\nI'm getting pretty annoyed by now because (1) I have no idea what I'm going to be doing in two months.  There are millions of things that could come up that would take priority over a friendly/professional/networking dinner.  (2)  She keeps suggesting high end restaurants that I really have no interest in going to.  Sure, we can all afford it, but I really have no interest in paying $150+ for me and my wife to put on a tie and drive an hour to sit uncomfortably at a white table cloth dinner with a waiter that comes around with a crumb scraper.  (3)  I have no idea if I'm going to be paying for myself, if the bill is going to be split between all of us, or if her business is paying for it.  I definitely don't want to sign up for splitting a massive bill with some of the other boozy invitees.  (4)  I would be much more inclined to attend if she said \"I'm having a BBQ at my house on this date, a bunch of people are invited, come if you can make it!\"  I just don't feel right making a commitment two months out, and I don't want to feel like I'm obligated to go to this thing if she keeps moving around the schedule to make sure I'm free on that date.  (5)  If she wants to be friends, let's be friends and do friend stuff.  If she wants to do professional networking, set up something professional.  But I can't stand this constant blurred line between the professional and personal relationship that she's trying to ride.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to commit to a dinner with someone who sends me business?

(She was constantly making up extravagant stories of her past and was really rude to her parents that she still lived with.) I was at a really vulnerable part in my life and decided to stay her friend because she was an escape from my shitty life. \n\nAnyways, I introduce her to my friends since she was new to the area. After Haley got close to them she turned them all on me. She constantly fed them lies until they didn’t like me anymore.\n\nI cut Haley out of my life immediately and figured it was good that she helped me figure out who my fake friends were. She showed up at my house unannounced a couple times begging me to be her friend again but I always had my sister answer the door because I thought I’d punch her if I answered. \n\nI was a lonely mess after all of this, convinced that everyone hated me. Haley really hurt me. I did some soul searching that year while I was alone. I realized I was so full of hate towards her that it was only bringing me down and I needed to forgive her for my own mental health. \n\nI messaged her saying that there was no hard feelings and I hoped she was doing okay. She insisted that we hang out and told me she did some soul searching too and she changed. Me being lonely, I said yes. \n\nWhen I met Haley’s boyfriend, Zack,  I realized I already knew him from middle school. Zack and I got along really well, better than Haley and I did and we became closer friends. He constantly confided in me that he wanted to break up with Haley every day. And Haley told me the same thing about Zack. They had a seriously fucked up relationship where they were constantly screaming at each other. \n\nAnyways they had an extra ticket to this music festival and begged me to go. Haley told me that she didn’t wanna go alone with Zack cause she’d be annoyed the whole time and Zack told me the same thing about Haley.  I figured a free ticket is a free ticket and I went. \n\nAfter the concert we were all really drunk. We went back to the hotel room and Haley insisted that we have a threesome. We were all down and went for it. Although Zack was really hot, I wasn’t that into Haley so I was really uncomfortable then Haley got uncomfortable too because her boyfriend was kinda just fucking me in front of her. She told him to stop, they starting having sex again, I felt weird and left the hotel room. \n\nZack came and found me after about 30 minutes and we walked to the parking garage. Anyways we had sex. \n\nI feel like Haley deserved what she got and I wouldn’t have had sex with Zack if they didn’t insist on having a threesome in the first place. I never planned on having sex with Zack before that moment. \n\nZack and I decided to keep that night a secret. After a week I felt guilty and told Haley. She didn’t believe me, stole my vape I left at her house and a bunch of my clothes. \n\nIt’s a year later and I still get texts from people telling me that Haley said I had sex with their boyfriend even though I didn’t. People from my home town think I have sex with anyone I meet and that I have STDs because of the rumors she’s made up about me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for having sex with Zack? ",

I have helped her plan parts of the trip and was completely on board until this past weekend when she sent me the detailed itinerary of the plans. I’ve been busy these past few weeks and I know she’s been working with ironing out the details with another one of her bridesmaids. \n\nSo the new details I learned this weekend that are making me want to back out were:\n\n1. We’re going away for two nights, not one. I have a full time job and a three year old. My husband is extremely hands on with our son and is totally capable of and will be happy to take care of him for two nights by himself. But I’ve never spent a night away from our son and I am not sure I want to do it now. I think it’s a lot to ask of my husband. Especially because my friend, as much as I love her, is not the most sacrificing by nature and would never do things that don’t fit into her normal life/routine for me. So I don’t want to go out of my way for her. \n\n2. There are going to be 15 people there, none of who I am super fond of or have anything in common with. I’ve met them a few times over the last 3-4 years and while they were okay to have a brief chat with over dinner, spending 2 days with them seems like A LOT to handle. I initially thought it’ll be just the bridesmaids so like 4-5 of us. \n\n3. They have plans to go clubbing one of the nights and I just don’t do that. Probably the only person in the group who doesn’t. I don’t drink and going clubbing with 15 people with who I have nothing in common just sounds quite unpleasant. \n\n4. I’m pregnant and will be 4-months along in April. This adds to the whole not wanting to go clubbing and on long hikes (I haven’t gone hiking in 3+ years) with a large group of women that I’m not friends with. Hiking features a lot in the planned itinerary. \n\n5. It’s going to be pricey and I’m not comfortable spending a huge amount of money on a weekend that I know I wouldn’t enjoy. I would actually be happier giving that money to my friend as an add-on to her wedding gift. \n\nSo how selfish am I being? My plan is to offer that instead of driving there on Friday night, I can drive up there on Saturday and be there for a photoshoot, lunch, hangout and dinner that she has planned and then drive back home. They have a few things planned for Sunday that I’ll miss but I’m okay with that. ",

It was a very cringy situation because the boy who won King is a straight male and he was made to be coupled with a gay male.

Before you get crazy and scold at me, I know what people say. I should respect the LGBT community. I do. I am very open to the idea of gay couple and gay marriage. I'd much agree if there were two gay Kings, or two gay Queens. Completely okay with it. But I feel like it is not true to call a gay boy \"Queen\" and assign him to a straight King. If the organizers are to select a king and a queen, they should be straight male and female. I think, the organizers are trying so hard to prove that they have an open mind and also to draw attention from the public.\n\nLike, in real life, one does not question a gay couple \"which one of you is the wife/husband?\" Right?

            "input": "This will probably be a long one, so strap in folks.\n\nThis August I started my freshman year of college. I came to a university about an hour and a half from my home and my boyfriend from back home would come to visit every weekend. \n\nFor some background, my parents have always been kind of ...weird? I hesitate to call them outright abusive, but going out to see my friends would always result in them making me feel guilty about not staying home with my family. I’d be expected to watch my sister (8) and brother (6) all summer long and during the week.\n\nThey were always specifically weird about me dating. My best friend when I was in 9th grade asked me out and I said yes. Yes we were both girls; yes I’m bi. Anyway, my parents flipped actual shit. I had come out to them, but I don’t think it was about that. They wanted me to explain why EXACTLY I liked my friend and wouldn’t accept the answers I would give. They cut me off from my only 2 friends and put me on “suicide watch” (my mom is a psych nurse). When I told my psychiatrist I felt depressed and had considered suicide, my parents yelled at me and told me it wasn’t that big of a deal. \n\nFlash forward to the fall of junior year, I start talking more and more to this guy that had always been part of my friend group but I never got to know that well. I tell my parents I want to date him. I immediately am told that I’ll never be left alone with him and that he’s not good enough for me and this and that. I broke it off with him quickly due to the intense pressure they had been putting on the relationship. Not too long afterwards, we started dating again because that’s what horny 16 year olds do. It had been kind of rough, but once he got his own car, we were able to sneak around pretty well. \n\nMy parents always suspected we were together. I told them we were casually dating but not official and I honestly think they have forgotten I told them that. My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years as of October though, and I’m honestly really happy in my relationship. \n\nFlash forward to early October this year: my parents find a corner of one of those sex ed condoms in my room back home and call me while I’m studying in the library. I’m essentially told I’m a whore (which I’ve actually been called due to my being on birth control because of suspected endometriosis), to send my phone (which my step father pays for... I wasn’t ever able to get a job back home because I was expected to babysit and no one would teach me how to drive) back to my parents, and that my parents wouldn’t be sending me the prescription for my Vyvanse (which I’ve been on for about 6 years for ADHD). I was accused of having sex in the house — something that would have been nearly impossible due to my parent’s schedules and also I just wouldn’t do that. \n\nNeedless to say, university was pretty difficult while I was unmedicated. I also got a statement from my school telling me that I owed them some $5,000. Seeing as my parents had effectively disowned me and my school wasn’t going to let me register for classes next semester because I had literally $200 in my bank account, I stopped going to classes and found a job. \n\nI was applying for a job at a coffee shop and an insurance agent from across the street told me to come in to her office and she’d interview me right then and there for a job as a telemarketer. Long story short, I ended up being pretty decent so she paid for me to take the licensing exam and I’m currently just waiting for the state to process my application. \n\nMy boyfriend from back home went to the local community college because he’s going to be able to go for 2 years debt free and then transfer to a university for comp sci. He’s moving down here on Friday (and I’m moving in with him) and he’s gonna go to the community here. Before you tell me how silly that is because we’re only 18, trust me I know, but really there wasn’t any other way I could get an apartment that I can afford before I get kicked out of my dorm because it’s the end of the semester. His parents are helping us out so much and I will be eternally grateful for them. \n\nMy parents wanted me to come home for thanksgiving. Apparently my mom (39) has been having seizures? My family has a history of weird made-up sounding medical conditions and I’m honestly not even sure what’s real or not in regards to that. I didn’t go home if that isn’t obvious. I also don’t think I want to come home for Christmas either. \n\nMy parents tell me it’s not fair to my brother and sister that I don’t come home, but I honestly fear for my safety if I were to go back home. My mom has filed a PFA against my step dad essentially for false imprisonment before and I honestly would have been able to do the same at least 3 times. \n\nTo be clear, my mom and I talk sporadically, but it’s not like she’s offering to talk about what’s going on. They came down here after the incident to have dinner with my boyfriend and I go talk about what happened. It was actually terrible. They put my sister in the chair between him and I and they were essentially interrogating me the whole time. My step dad kept offering me money (which he wouldn’t have actually given me) to break up with my boyfriend. My boyfriend isn’t like a terrible person or anything. He was a decent student I high school and my friend group is really just d&amp;d and mtg nerds. I was very involved in high school (president of like 3 clubs) and he supported me every step of the way. My parents know all of this. \n\n\nI know there are probably gaps that I didn’t fill in all the way, so feel free to ask questions. I’m also on mobile so idk if the formatting is gonna be weird or not. \n\nTl;dr: am I the asshole for not wanting to go home for the holidays after my parents disowned me?",

We opened the door and a super friendly stray cat came up to us and wanted to be pet. We were cautious but gave it attention. It was declawed and extremely skinny so we figured it had been a house cat in the past. The next day it was still outside our house, so I went and bought some cat food and we posted the cat on our neighborhood facebook page. No luck finding the owner. Then I decided to ask my neighbors if it was their cat, and they said that he had been missing for 2 weeks but they didn't want to bring him in the house yet because they didn't want to give fleas to their other pets. This sounded okay at first but now it sounds weird, especially since the cat was declawed and malnourished. It has no way to fend for itself outside, and it is cold here at night, around 30 degrees F. They also have a responsibilty to care for that cat since they are the owners, right? Anyways, I didn't see the cat for a day so I thought they took him back in. But he turned back up today, meowing at my back door. I went and tried to tell my neighbor but they wouldn't answer the door. I tried again an hour later and the cat followed me to their door, so I picked the cat up to give it to them. They finally answer the door after I wait for a few minutes, and the cat starts freaking out when he  sees the owner and clawing me up. The owner grabs the cats back skin, not even the scruff, and kinda tosses him in the house saying he doesnt know what hes going to do. It was a really weird experience, and it made me think that the owners were abusive. AITA for bringing a possibly abused cat back to the owners? AITA for rushing the owners to take in their obviously indoor cat?",

He pretty much sucks the air out of any room he's in so that he can talk about himself.  He's an \"actor-writer\" (a.k.a. a waiter) so he's obsessed with self-promotion, and he seems to see people strictly as tools to talk about himself.  If we're grabbing coffee, he'll talk the barista's ear off about his writing as if the barista were Scott Rudin in disguise. If I go away on vacation, he tells me to bring something back for him without even saying please. When I get back, he doesn't ask how the trip was, he just says \"Don't forget to bring me my chocolate!\" When someone else gets a compliment, he does this whole self-pity thing where he fishes for an equal, if not greater, compliment.\n\nI tried to let it slide and force myself to enjoy his company, when all of a sudden, I couldn't take it anymore. I realized how much I dreaded being around him. I couldn't ignore how embarrassed I was to have him around my other friends. There is a profound, fundamental self-centeredness about this person that is truly shocking. I admit that I am an idiot for letting it go on this long and not having a spine, but I try to be nice, and I always convince myself that I can be obliging and self-sacrificial and patient. But I'm...not. \n\nSo the next time we ran into each other, I was cold. So cold that even *he* noticed. Once I get to a certain point, I'm incapable of hiding my emotions. I told him how I don't even feel like a person around him, just a tool. He mostly talked about himself and his own feelings, asked for examples of when he was self-centered (Examples? Every time! Every word!) When I gave examples, he had an excuse for each of them. \n\nBut he also said he wants to do better as a friend. I don't think he's capable of it--his narcissism seems marrow-deep. He asked me what he could do to make things better which I guess is an appropriate thing to say but, coming from him, just seemed to be more of his \"Figure out this labor for me so that I don't have.\"\n\nI get the feeling that, best case scenario, he'll hide his selfishness long enough to repair our \"friendship\" and then revert back to who he is at his core as soon as he can. Worst case scenario, I have to walk him through the whole process of pretending to care about other people and it'll be just as exhausting, but in a different way. \n\nAm I a bad person for suddenly bringing up all these issues, dropping him out of the blue, and for not giving him a second chance? Looking back, I don't know how the friendship lasted this long (actually, I do--I repressed a lot of feelings!) but I don't think I can go back. I don't like being mean or cutting friends, though. ",

Grandparents dead, no contact with any other family members. Me, my two brothers, and her are the extent of the family.\n\nSo let me start this off by saying that my mother is dying. She has probably a month to live, and that's being hopeful. I'm not going to bother going into the details, and if I'm being quite honest, I'm not 100% sure of all of them. Apparently it's common for patients with it to have heart attacks or strokes, and after she had one stroke she asked that if she had another one to not help her and let her go. I'm not certain if the hospital is allowed to do that, but that was her request (the reason I'm not sure of all the details is because I'm not at the hospital with her. My older brother stays with her, and me and my other brother try to make it to any important news sharing from the doctor. \n\nWhen we were younger, my mother always said she wanted to see all of us settle down and start a family with someone we loved, so we could have what she never got to. Both of my older brothers succeeded and made her happy with that, but I have not. However, I have been in an extremely casual relationship for the past year. I'm talking basically a FWB type thing but slightly more serious. We've gone out on dates with other people in that time with no jealousy, but if either of us ever wanted to maybe make things more serious, we'd be open to the possibility of it. I've brought her home to holidays and such at home, but my mom is aware of how casual we are. \n\nSo with my mother's wish she always expressed when we were younger, and the current... situation, I've been considering telling my mom that my \"girlfriend\" and I are engaged, so that she can die at least thinking I'm on my way to creating the life she always wanted for me. When I told my brothers my idea, they had different responses. The oldest said I was an asshole for even considering manipulating our mother, but the other understands where I'm coming from and would be okay with me doing it, even if he wouldn't do it if he was in my situation. I also talked to my \"girlfriend\" and she said she would do it if I thought it was for the best. I'm just worried that if I do my oldest brother will think I'm an asshole and resent me for it, and honestly I'm not too sure if it's the best idea myself.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA?",

I decided to take a job offer with better pay and worse hours (80+ hours a week) so my husband could stay home and study for his CDL. He claimed to want a more stable career. \n\nThis continues for several months until I completely burn myself out trying to manage the kids (4) and the household while working so much. My husband decided to start looking for a job again, putting a pin in the CDL goal. He found a job that took him away from home for 3-4 months at a time working in agricultural construction this past spring. While he was gone I decided to go back to college online. \n\nHe worked there for four months before he **intentionally** got fired (he told me this). During this time he was striking up conversations with an ex, who has been a continuous dark cloud over our relationship because of my own insecurities. He then comes back to Indiana and tells his father I said he wasn’t allowed back home because he didn’t have a job (I never said these words and I didn’t know he was coming back home until after he’d already returned to the state.) \n\nHis father gives him an under-the-table job two hours away from our home, so my husband has been staying with his dad and his uncle for the last six months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been trying to get a handle on our money because I am hoping to go to law school and my credit report doesn’t look so great. I started working on a budget this afternoon and four hours later I had all the finances in one place. While my husband and I were texting about our days, I sent him a photo of what I’d done for the day. He makes an inaccurate comment about how we would have “$500 left over a month.” \n\nI explain to him we wouldn’t have any left-overs anymore because I was doing a zero-based budget. I joke that I didn’t think he would read everything so closely and he shuts down for a moment. He then goes into it, telling me how he needs to pay his dad back for all the charity and is upset I didn’t consult with him. \n\nI try explaining to him these numbers were based on whether or not my ex-husband would pay his child support payments on time every week (which he hasn’t done for 11 years, but they started up again recently). He then takes offense that I used his name and ends the conversation before “it leads to a stupid ass argumentative tone that ends up with us getting nasty with each other”. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t finished explaining the budget but he wanted to end the conversation without letting me explain. So I messaged him anyway. He goes off, implying I think he should screw over his father and telling me “it’s nice you can write the whole budget without even asking if I have any debts I need to settle”. (Him not being considerate of me has been an ongoing issue in our relationship – including him disappearing for hours into the early morning with his friend to get high and not calling me – and it has never been a problem for the past three years that I’ve managed the finances without “consulting” him.)\n\nI threw my hands up. I’m functioning as a single mother of four, in college full-time, one of my children has ODD/ADD and I’m driving back and forth to the school twice a week for a problem, my kids have 2-3 out of school activities a piece, I’m the only one cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, paying the bills, dealing with household problems.\n\nI acknowledge on a weekly basis how much it means to me that my husband works so hard and keeps a steady income so we can pay for necessities. I give him massages every time I see him because he’s in manual labor. I do not feel like I downplay what he does at all. I do not receive the same acknowledgment.\n\nI told him he could hand the finances, then, and he agreed. I gave him every password to every account.  He states we’re going to have a surplus of cash because he didn’t know what half the accounts were (I only sent him our utilities, two credit cards we don’t use, the internet log in, our car insurance, and our debt consolidation payment). He then tells me the bills will just “have to wait” until he has better internet service. \n\nI tell him I would take that as a sign of being apathetic to the needs of his family. I told him “since I’ve been doing such a shitty job handling the finances, there’s no reason for money to continue to touch my hands”. He claims I put words in his mouth and then said “fuck you” to me. I told him he didn’t say it, but he implied it. I wrote down a nicer way he could have asked. \n\nHe tells me I blew shit out of proportion “in a feminine manner” and that I “make \\[him\\] look like a dumbass”. (There were just the two of us texting???) I asked him if he thought my opinions, thoughts, words, and ideas don’t matter because I have a vagina.\n\nHe exact words were “Well, if the stereotypical shoe fits, makeover them Pradas”. (I don’t even know what this means, the most expensive pair of shoes I own I got on clearance for less than $30.) At this point, I stop responding to him because it’s not getting anywhere and he’s being ridiculous.\n\nAfterward, he called me on the phone and demanded my email account information. I told him I didn’t want to give it to him and told him it was not because I have anything to hide, but because of the nasty way, he demanded it. He told me to shut the fuck up. I hung up on him. \n\nHe called back and asked if I was done being a bitch. I hung up again. \n\nHe called back and started screaming at me. At one point he accused me of thinking I’m always right about everything (which is completely untrue and I’ve, on more than just one occasion, admitted to being wrong/defeated, and I’m not a spoiled sport about it). I told him he was being disrespectful by calling me names and telling me to “shut up”. I said I wanted a divorce and that I didn’t want a partner who couldn’t be mad without disrespecting me. He mocked me and told me he wouldn’t sign papers.\n\nI told him I didn’t need his signature and that the courts grant contested divorces. He finally stopped screaming at me and said “Fine, I’ll sign your damn papers and find somewhere else to live”. And he hung up.",

I don’t know how to approach this with C—especially because E would be here while I said “hey, we have talked about this.”\n\nI get that C pays rent here. However, he refused to sign the lease, which our landlords said needed to be done if he was to move in. I asked him for literally 3 months to do it and gave up.  I get he pays rent but he’s not even on our lease if something goes wrong, and before moving in knew about my discomfort.\n\nBasically, WIBTA if I told C that E needs to go? Debating if C needs to too. Thanks everyone.\n",

We hadn’t spent much time with them before, which aunt told my dad was because they never liked my mother.\n\nWe never had much in common and it always felt a bit forced spending time with them now. Uncle is very controlling and always made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I refused to hug him once and he followed my around trying to force me to, and told me I was being disrespectful. He’s also intimidated me before when my dad wasn’t around, telling me I won’t get on in life if I’m not more likeable.\n\nCousins have got worse over the years, and last time they visited us they wanted to spend the whole time with my sister, and tried to leave me and my boyfriend on a shopping trip when we driven them into town, so they could just hang out with my sister. They even tricked her into going on a walk with them without me. After they left my sister told me that they had been badmouthing me and my dad, saying that I would be a bad mother and that I was too affectionate with my boyfriend.\n\nAunt doesn’t say much and likes to pretend her family is perfect, but is really judgemental of us.\n\nA few weeks ago my aunt called my dad (they talk every week) and during the conversation mentioned that he should come and visit sometime, and that my sister (who’s just finished university) would be welcome to move in with them and look for a job there.

            "input": "Background info: My family has a long tradition of drinking socially together; it's a very acceptable practice in our culture as well. Whenever my adult siblings, parents, and I get together we almost always have a few cocktails together and talk and laugh and have a merry time. None of us will drive if we're impaired and we won't allow anyone else to drive if they've been drinking. \n\nIt's also common knowledge in my family that me and all of my siblings drank when we were underage. In my country the legal drinking age is 21. My parents would often give us a glass of wine with dinner when we were younger or if they were hosting a party they would often let us drink some wine or beer. They most likely knew that when we were teenagers we were drinking at parties with friends, but they turned a blind eye to that. \n\nNow my brother has two sons. He is very strict with them and tries very hard to control every aspect of their lives, not to be a dick, but because he really wants them to be safe. One of his sons, Ian, who is 17, has often expressed to me his frustration at how strict his dad is and how he feels like he can't do a lot of fun things that his friends get to do. A typical teen-aged complaint, I think. \n\nI've always been the \"cool aunt\" to all of my nieces and nephews and because of that they have an adult to turn to when they want to talk about things their parents may not approve of like sex or drinking. Ian has confided in me about how he has to lie to his dad (my brother) about where he goes out with his friends because my brother won't let him go to parties. Ian also likes to tell me about the fun he's had drinking with his friends. I always tell him to be careful and to never drive drunk and to never let a friend drive drunk. But I also laugh with him and share in the fun he has in telling me his \"going out drinking with the boys\" stories. \n\nSo my brother and his fam live in a completely different part of the country than I do and we only see each other on holidays a couple of times per year. So during the last holiday that they visited, we were all gathered at my parents' home. Everyone was there - my three siblings and all of their kids (in their 20s) and me and my husband and my parents. Everyone was getting pretty lit and drinking and laughing except for Ian who's only 17. So on the sly I asked him if he wanted me to make him a drink and he said yes. So I made him a vodka...and then another....and then another. Keep in mind that we were at the home of my parents, no one was driving that night as we were all planning on crashing there. No guests outside of family members were present, and we had no plans to go anywhere else that night. \n\nAs the evening progressed Ian started acting tipsy. Everyone, including his mum, noticed and thought is was funny. They figured out that I must've given him some drinks. My brother was the very last person to catch on. When he did figure it out, Ian told him that I had given him the alcohol. My brother was fuming mad at me, but we didn't talk about it because it was late and everyone just wanted to crash. In the morning my brother and his fam all left early to drive back to their home a few hours away.\n\nThe next week a get a call from my brother and he was absolutely livid that I gave Ian some drinks. He went on and on about how Ian had never tasted alcohol before I gave him some that night and that now his son is corrupted because of me and also how I've undone all the great parenting he and his wife have done with Ian and that because of me he's now destined to be some sort of hoodlum (he's at the top of class and a stellar student btw). He went on to say that I have no boundaries and that I've been undermining his family for years (not sure how since we've never lived in the same part of the country since he's had kids?). And now because of what I did, my brother has chosen to remain very distant towards me. He continues to hold it against me that I gave Ian alcohol. He doesn't invite me to his home anymore for holidays, though he'll invite the rest of my family members. My other siblings still maintain a relationship with him, but they almost keep it secret from me because they know that my brother doesn't talk to me socially anymore or invite me to his home, and I'm guessing they don't want me to feel bad.\n\nI realize that I exhibited poor boundaries by giving Ian some drinks and I apologized profusely many times to my brother and to his wife. I completely owned up to my poor judgement and made no excuses for it. I'm not Ian's parent and I don't make the rules for him. But I feel like the degree of outrage expressed by my brother is disproportionate to my transgression. Especially considering that my brother drank when he was a teenager. And now I don't have a relationship with my brother anymore and I really miss him. Is he over-reacting or AITA?",

She said DD smelled like smoke and that she has never smelled like smoke after picking her up from his house or with me. He and I both smoke. I only smoke outside, with the door shut -even before daughter- and he smokes in his apartment. I suspect he typically doesnt smoke in his apartment for the few hours that she is with him because she has never smelled like smoke before, even to my nonsmoker mom. So that leads me to believe he smoked inside this last visit.\n\nI 100% do not believe I have any right to ask him not to stop smoking completely in his own apartment. The only exception being when DD is there. We all know cigarettes are toxic AF (and I really shouldnt be smoking at all), especially for developing children. My stance is that its lazy and selfish as hell not to go outside. I did not say that to him, nor insinuate it.\n\nI explained that shed never smelled like smoke before and for DD's health, please dont smoke inside while shes with him. I dont want her developing breathing issues because of his (and my) choices. She does not have a choice so we shouldn't be making choices for her that harm her. \n\nHis response : he smoked a lot the night before but didnt while she was there and didnt really say either way if hed be sure to go outside to smoke while DD is there.\n\nI didnt say this to him, but I dont really believe him. Hes smoked a lot the night before (evidence on the table) I've dropped her off with a different outcome.\n\nSo here's the actual WIBTA question. He has not made any effort to get his car fixed (hed much rather be chauffeured around) and I usually take DD for visits, with my mom doing pickup if I have to work and ex's parents occassionally helping. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped driving her over there if DD continues to come home smelling like smoke? If he makes other arrangements for p/u and d/o, I likely wouldn't keep her from him, but its doubtful hed do that.\n\n\nWe do not have an official custody in place, so he gets her when he can, but usually *only* when its convenient (which sometimes leads to weeks between visits, it's gotten a little better though). He pays a small amount in child support, usually late. Other than that and the short visits, doesnt do anything to contribute to DD's care. He makes very few sacrifices for DD (I'd say none, with the exception of small CS), the least he can do is take it outside when shes with him for a couple of hours.  I drive her to support the father daughter relationship, but don't want to if hes going to smoke inside. \n\n\nTL;DR : cigarettes are bad and dad wants to smoke inside for the few hours he has our &lt;1 year old.

We have all come off the same flight which was delayed by 2 hours, so are 2 hours behind our individual schedules on top of the impending 6 hour roadie.   \n\nWe're having toilet breaks along the way but are all keeping it as brief as possible. We're driving away from a lunch break when a girl yells out to the driver to stop- she's lost her phone. A bit of communal panic ensues and we of course turn around and head back.\n\nThe girl is travelling with her bf who is obnoxious in a few ways: yawning ridiculously loudly in a small space without covering his mouth, falling asleep numerous times and essentially resting himself on my shoulder (I would politely inch forward until his gf would pull him back over), ball space to suit 3 men, etc etc. \n\nSo, she loses her phone and is STRESSED. We pull up, she jumps out, the driver jumps out as well and helps her look (we're on a small touristy island - in my home country - I can confidently say that if someone finds the phone, they're not handing it in). The bf doesn't get out to help her (???) but kind of looks around the seat half heartedly and ends up finding it under the seat. \n\nHe announces with zero sense of urgency: \"Yeah it's here ha ha, she's unbelievable.\"  We're all relieved. Maybe 15 seconds goes past and everyone's like uhh are you going to tell her? And he says, \"no she deserves to panic, she's always losing her shit, this happens all the time. Let her panic\". He says that she has to learn her lesson one day or another. I say half-jokingly, (enough for him to hear but not making a statement to the whole van) \"maybe right now isn't when she needs to learn the lesson though?\" He ignores me.\n\nWe're a van full of strangers watching her and the driver frantically run around this dodgy restaurant and he's laughing, and someone comments \"it's funny but the driver is out there stressing too sooo...\" Bf responds with: \"classic. She's so ridiculous. She would be so pissed.\"   By now we've awkwardly watched this shitshow for about 5 minutes. \n\nMe: \"surely tell her now?\"\nHim: \"no, it's funny?\" (Smug at this point). \n\nSo I lean over him, open the door and yell \"WE FOUND IT!\" She gets back in totally relieved and apologetic, we're all kinda laughing (with her) to make light of the situation. I say, \"he found it the moment you got out of the van\" and again others laugh, she laughs too but also looks at him like seriously?! \n\nHe then gives me absolute you-asshole daggers, mutters something under his breath and, to let her into her seat makes a point of completely shoving me out of the way (he's a 6 foot 3 male, I'm a 5 foot 3 female).

She said she understood and was fully supportive, but still asks me to go out drinking, dancing, etc... when I really only have the energy to lay around her apartment. \n\nYesterday, I told her I needed a 4 week break to simply focus on my health and recharge. She was heartbroken. She told me she doesn’t expect me to come back, but that she cares and wants me to get healthy. I’m so torn. I care about her, but I’m not sure what I want with her right now because I’m to exhausted to think clearly. She’s the perfect girlfriend, but I can’t physically handle anything outside work and immediate family right now. AITA for asking for a break from her? ",

I recently (a month and a half ago) started dating this guy and he's been a great bf. He's friends with the guys in our group so two weeks after I started dating him I invited him to come along to an event. My friends all seemed to enjoy having him there so whenever we go do something together, I invite him. Over the past week and a half I've noticed my friends are flirting a LOT with him and he's is apparently enjoying it and doing nothing to stop them. Yesterday we went to a restaurant and the flirting would just not stop and he barely talked to me. After we ate I asked him if we could speak privately. We went outside and I told him I didn't like the way he was encouraging the flirting and told him I didn't want him to come to any more events for the time being. He told me that it wasn't him doing the majority of the flirting and that he was very sorry for barely talking to me but that it was unfair for him to be held to a double standard because the guys in my friend group flirt with me a lot too. I told him that we've been friends for years and that it's not the same as him flirting with people he recently met. After this I told my friends that I didn't like how much he'd been flirting with them so he wouldn't be coming to anymore events and all of them (including the guys) started telling me that I'm an asshole. \n\nSo, AITA for no longer inviting my BF to events?",

I had one exam on his birthday and two exams the next day. Because of this, I wasn’t able to go. And I told him that 2 days before his birthday. He’s now aware that I am not going and how busy I am in school.\n\nIt is now his birthday. Before I sent him a happy birthday text and an apology for not going, I find out that he stopped sharing his location with me, which seemed odd to me. I didn’t bring this up though. An hour after I texted him, I see him posting on instagram and I now know he’s ignoring me since he didn’t reply. Another 20 minutes or so goes by and I get a text from him. “K” was his response. \n\nAt this point I was mad because I apologized and I greeted him, while he forgot my birthday last year.

He works a full time job, as do I, and he just went back to school to finish his last semester of college (he failed a couple of courses last time he went 2 years ago, I'll get to that). His job is shift work, and he rotates between afternoons (3-11pm) and nights (11pm-7am). During the day, he goes to school, and he squeezes studying and sleeping in between those hours.\n\nI work a full time job in a city just over an hours job away if traffic is good. It's a very demanding job, and I often have to take work home with me. I do the majority of the care of our son, obviously because my fiance is so busy. I'm also 6 months pregnant.\n\nNow, the AITA part. My fiance often spends very long hours in the garage, staying up all night studying or doing other projects (he's just getting into wood working and likes doing renos on our house). The big issue though is that my fiance is an alcoholic. 90% of the time he pulls these all-nighters, he drinks. He's often running himself dead because his life is so demanding right now, and to top it off he refusing to see my view: that staying up all night like he does is a terrible, negative habit that is destroying him and our relationship. I've argued that he doesn't study as effectively if he's running on no sleep and drinking. I've tried explaining that it's terrible for his health. I've tried explaining that when he does this, it falls on me to make sure that he gets out of bed to go to work and go to school, and he's damn near impossible to wake up. He often gets mad at me for waking him. It's also the exact kind of environment and habit he should be avoiding because he trying to quit drinking. This kind of behaviour is why he ended up failing the two courses he's retaking in the first place. \n\nThe biggest kicker is, though, that I just really want to spend more time with him. I feel so alone, and I feel like he could spend more time with his family if he just chose to sleep at night and do the things he needs to do during the day/evening. He misses out on spending time and doing things with us and he doesn't see it because he's not there to notice it. I even offered to help him study. He's a wonderful person that works harder than anyone I know. I love him very much.\n\nHe says that I'm being controlling and selfish because this is one thing he enjoys doing and I want to take it from him. He says he feels like a puppet on a string that is expected to do things when I want regardless of how he feels. He explained that he works shift work and his sleep schedule is messed up to begin with, so he can't always sleep. \n\nI could go on for a while longer, especially about his drinking, but I want to keep it to just this one thing\n\nTL;DR: My fiance works full time and goes to school part time, and often stays up all night drinking and studying. AITA for wanting him to spend more time with his family and go to bed at night instead?",

Using a throwaway account as I am not interested in Karma and the details are very private so I wish to remain anonymous. Warning this is long, as I am a very detailed person. This is just one issue in a very hard year, as there is much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo start off I guess, my son is dead. My little boy was 13 months old. A pillar of health. We cherished and looked after that boy with all we had. His perfect on Tuesday and Dying on Wednesday, and passed 7 days later. This is a whole other story unto itself.  I got along well enough with my in-laws. my mother-in-law acts very immature and erratic. My wife told her mom used to an alcoholic. As I got more confident in my relationship with my wife I told her \"I think your mom might have alcoholic brain damage\"\n\nWhere I need help is this...\n\nMy son needed emergency surgery as his brain, for unexplained reasons, was swelling. They had to remove part of his skull to allow for the expansion. My parents arrived within an hour of my call. My in-laws (whom this post is about) arrived much later even though they live 30 mins closer.\n\nMy in-laws left as quickly as they arrived. My parents however stayed.  They slept on waiting room coffee tables waiting to hear if our little boy would live. He made it through that first surgery, only to pass away the day after mother's day.\n\nMy parents never left our side. Even though they had brought no clothes or supplies. My in laws on the other hand did not reappear until it was time to say goodbye. My mother-in-law arrived in Pajama shorts and a t shirt that was too small to hid her girth. She began to ask the nurse if they ever treated any murders.\n\nAs we took our time saying our goodbyes, she noisily played games on her iPad.\n\nThe nurses arranged it so we could take him outside one last time even though he was on life support. You see our son rarely cried but whenever he did we simply took him outside. It cheered him up instantly. Being outdoors was his favorite place in the world.\n\nMy wife went first, and held him one last time beneath the stars to say goodbye before I even had my turn my mother in law asked us to hurry up. I was furious. I told her in he calmest voice I could muster \"leave\". I meant for her to go home. She took it as permission to go inside. She stopped to clarify and I just said \"Go!\"\n\nWe brought my son back inside and they disconnected him from the machines that kept him alive. It was the hardest thing ever. (I have been diagnosed with depression, severe anxiety and PTSD and I am on anti-depressants as a result.)\n\nWhile we were waiting for him to pass on he slowly was turning grey my mother in law decided to clean up his hospital room. Problem with that is as you know she wasn't there, so the stuff she was throwing out was our paperwork from the social worker for grief support etc.  My mom stopped her from throwing it out. While I yelled at her to stop. All the while my father-in-law and sister-in-law sat there doing nothing with annoyed looks.\n\nWhen he was finally gone, my wife had to wait for the nurses to remove him from her arms, which is quite difficult as he was limp. My mother-in-law left immediately. When my wife got up she asked crying \"where is my mom? I need a hug\".\n\nWe did not see or speak to my in laws for 2 days. We couldn't bear the hurt on top of the grief. I decided to clear the air and invited just my father-in law for lunch. He arrived and made idle chit chat and then got up to leave. I said what about lunch? He said he needed to get home. We told him to wait; we needed to discussed somethings.\n\nWe described how hurt we were by my mother in laws behavior and he said she just didn't cope well. We said we would do our best to understand, but while we are sorting out our feelings please ask her not to disturb us, and also if she is struggling that she has the option not to come to our son's visitation, we would understand. His response was \"well I guess I'll go home and kill myself\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no clue what he said to my mother-in-law. Next thing we know she phones and says \"I hear you are upset with me. TOO. FUCKING.BAD. I won't be at the visitation.\" 'Click'\n\nI was furious. I feel like I had just failed as a father, I was not going to fail as a husband. I immediately called her back and tore her a new one. Her response was \"I am not going to talk to you if you are going to use that language\".\n\nI said \"Fuck you! you don't get to swear at my grieving wife and then claim some kind of moral high ground!\" She hung up on me. She immediately phone my wife who has said and done nothing at this point. She calls my wife a fucking bitch and hangs up. She begins to phone us every 2 seconds. The she starts sending threatening texts that she will harm us.\n\nI call my father-in-law and told him to get things under control or I am calling the police. He begged me not to call the cops and took away her phone.\n\nThe calls stopped.\n\nWe did not receive any support from my wife's family. They did not attend any events prior to his Visitation. My father in-law showed up late to my sons visitation in cargo shirt and an old golf shirt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days pass. I call my wife's aunt who I have gotten to know a little as they are not a close family.\n\nI asked her for some perspective on the my mother-in law. She said they had a falling out over 20 years ago. The aunt had apparently cancelled a sleep over between my wife and her cousin. The cousin didn't want to go anymore.\n\nMy mother-in-law told the aunt \"I hope you die\". She then drove over to their home knocked on the aunt's door and told her again face to face \"I hope you die\". Apparently My wife's family disappeared for 3 years. the extended family had no idea where they were.\n\nThen we spoke to my Wife's grandmother. She told us that my mother in law was diagnosed as bi-polar years ago and has a history of violent behavior, including smashing the grandmother in a car door, repeatedly.\n\nThe grandmother says re-iterates that they lost track of my wife and in-laws whereabouts for 3 years. She feared that she would be violent towards my wife. My wife broke into tears saying that her mother had beaten her repeatedly in her drunken stupors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we have a clearer picture. my Mother in-law is mentally ill.\n\nMy father-in-law knew this and hid it from his children. He knew how unstable his wife was and still brought her to the hospital. He completely mismanaged the situation by keeping everyone in the dark. My wife asked him very respectfully for a break in communication(advice from her therapist) as she needed to heal and her family was hurting more than helping.\n\nIts been a few months and we finally heard from him again. I have copy and pasted his email below\n\n \"I hope you are doing well, you are always in my thoughts. I'm   \nwriting this email because we really need your help with mom.  \nShe has been in the psych. ward in the Brantford hospitable twice, once   \nfor 6 days and then for over 2 weeks.  \nThe root of this problem was her reaction to Luca's passing and how her   \nreaction to this was treated. As her therapist says, everybody reacts to   \ndeath differently and no two people grieve the same. I think it would be   \nhealthier if you two could  get past this and start a healing process.  \nAt the present your mother is sliding back into her very depressed   \nstate, brought on by two things: the absence of Lucas and the absence of   \nher eldest daughter. She said this to her therapist at her latest session.  \nI'm sure mum miss's you and thinks of you often but is nervous to reach   \nout to you as you may not be ready for this.  \nMoms therapist is very concerned with your moms mental state so........I   \nthink a phone call or set up a visit ( just you ) to see if you two can   \nreconnect at some level, even if it's meeting at a coffee shop or at   \nmom's therapist's office. Whatever you are both comfortable with.  \nIt may or may not work but I see this as a good viable option to whats   \ngoing on now.  \nSo, mull this over and please let me know if us getting together is a   \npossibility. We would really like it to be.  \nLove Dad. \"\n\nIn her response my wife told him everything we had learned and pointed out how he had failed as a father, including this email which was void of fatherly concern for her well being. She did offer to meet with mother in laws therapist, if it would help.\n\nHis response was \"Sorry to have disappointed you. Have a nice life!\"\n\nI was furious with this email. Not only did he not care about my wife's mental state, he did not try to reestablish communications first before making an ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has made the decision she is done with her parents. I have supported her decision as they have been toxic to both our recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

They're quite prominent, but it doesn't bother me. I live in quite a sectarian city that I won't name. Catholics and Protestants have had a long hatred of eachother which has only started to recently cool a bit. I'm not a catholic in the religious sense, probably more agnostic, but I come from a catholic family. I should note, where I live, being a catholic generally equates to a nationalist while being a protestant generally equates to being a unionist. I am a non practicing catholic bordering on agnostic and am 100% nationalist. My girlfriend is not religious and is 100% unionist. \n\nSo after I got my ashes done we went out for the day. I didn't tell her I'd got them done so I thought it would be a bit of a shock, but not a big deal and we could laugh about it. When we met up, she immediatly told  me off for getting them, that I shouldn't have cause I'm not religious. She refused to walk next to me, and after saying I look like a retard she half-jokingly said that she didn't want to be seen with me and if she'd have known she'd have just went out with me tomorrow. she insisted I wash it off but I refused. While I might not be the most religious person, I am proud of where I come from, and I find that participating in religious events from my culture is a good way for me to express that. \n\nI told her if she was going to be like this then I'd simply get a bus home, she walked on past me. While I was waiting she texted me and essentially told me to come back, she was getting cold. When I got down to her, she was on the phone to her friend. Her friend was in the same place we were headed so she planned to meet up with her. This kinda hurt, it seemed like she wanted someone else to be around so she wasn't alone with me. Her friend is also protestant, and I didn't want to be made fun of by my SO and her friend. I made up a story about having a test to study for tomorrow so I had to go home. She gave me an annoyed \"bye\" and walked in the opposite direction. \n\nI don't see the problem, I like getting my ashes done, even it's not for explicitly religious reasons, it's just something I've always done. I don't agree with her political beliefs but I don't belittle her for it, I occasionally make light digs if it comes up in conversation and apologise if she thinks I went too far. \n\nThis happened about an hour ago and we haven't spoke since, normally, we'll both apologise in an argument, but I don't feel i should this time, I feel I've been treated wrongly for simply getting a black cross on my forehead\n\nSo Reddit, I know nobody wants to get involved in religious debates, but AITA?",

Until recently I was his power of attorney, I'm treated just like I was his firstborn child. He can be very manipulative and it's gotten worse in recent years, this has put a strain on our relationship but nothing like the strain created when he started dating his now fiancee.  \n\nLet me say that if she were pleasant, I would welcome this new person in my life. But she is not. She is constantly hostile and rude. She seems to not understand why I'm still in my stepdad's life (despite the fact that he started dating my mom when I was 2) and has looked for every possible opportunity to make me out to be the bad guy. She's a jerk to my younger siblings (his kids), but doesn't seem to try to drive them out like she does me. I'm 30 and only visit occasionally, it's not like I'm dependent on them by any means.  \n\nThis all came to a head recently because of yet another situation where I was totally alienated. I basically decided I was done trying.  \n\nHe reached out and said he felt I'd been distant. I kind of just told him everything I'd been thinking. I didn't name call or say anything unforgivable, but basically just said that the way she treats my brothers is terrible but that the way she treats me is substantially worse. He asked if we could discuss it in person and I said that was fine. We haven't spoken since then but I figured we would when he was ready.  \n\nToday I find out from my sibling that our dog is not doing well and might need to be put down. I'm absolutely crushed. They got him when I was in college but outside of my dogs he is my favorite dog on earth. If they have to put him down, they'll do it at their home (her house) and I'd really love to be there to say goodbye and to support my siblings. However I don't know if I'd be a huge asshole for showing up or asking if I can. I feel like I might be an equally big asshole for not showing up (\"you couldn't put that aside even for the dog?!\") so if I have to risk one I'd rather pick the one that lets me say goodbye to my best little buddy.  \n\nDo I wait and see if I’m invited?

To clarify, that means things like asking for hugs, sitting very close to me at every opportunity (thighs touching).

He constantly talks to me about what a horrible person Tim is and how awful he treats people. I get pretty tired of hearing it all, and Tim knows James' saying things like this to me, but he doesnt really care at this point. Tim has always been more of the level headed one, and he has no intention of talking to me about James or trying to change my opinion of him. James, on the other hand, just can't accept the fact that I remain friends with Tim. He stepped it up and now gets furious at me, asking \"How can you be be friends with Tim after he treated me so badly? Do you not see the way he treats me?\" I get that Tim was mean to James, but James acts like he is completely innocent. It takes two to argue, and when he brings up Tim's horrible treatment, I tell him that he also treated Tim horribly, and that he's not the victim. He views this as me attempting to \"Justify James' horrible actions\" and gets even angrier. Fast forward to three weeks ago. James messaged Tim, and he was attempting to get an apology out of him. This lead to a huge blowout, with many more insults flung from both parties. Right after the argument, James texts me and tells me that he can't be friends with anyone who is friends with Tim, including me. \"It's either me or him\". Of course, I didn't stand for this. I told him off, angrily telling him he has no right to choose who I'm friends with. I also told him I don't want to stop being friends with either of them, and that if he wants to stop being friends with me, it's his own choice. He's acted very different since then, and I feel a bit bad. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

She bought a cake, a bottle of tequila, made a fun quiz about me for the party and came up with what my flatmates should get me. I had a great time! I have social insecurities and felt very loved. I was and still am grateful for all this effort she went to. A few weeks later, I signed a lease with her and 2 other girls to live with her next year.\n\nSince then, things have gone south. By November, it was clear that Katie and I weren't getting on. I felt like she often spoke down to me and made me out to be stupid, was snappy and generally rude to me. She also acts this way to my other flatmate Gemma. This behaviour was picked up by my other flatmates too. There have been a handful of fall-outs, I've reached out to her to make amends, asked if I've done anything wrong but all in all its been a fairly direct conflict-free relationship. \n\nI now actively dislike Katie.

I (14F) was very close with her up through that but then when I started 8th grade I realized that I actually didn’t like being around her. The bad things hadn’t started yet though. \n\n       A couple months ago Ashley came over to my house and told me that she had started doing drugs. Not cocaine or anything, but weed and experimental things like cough syrup. Also, weed is legal where I live, but certainly not for minors. It’s not for medicinal purposes or anything, either, she just does it for fun.

At least I thought it was subtle. Ashley  said before that she didn’t expect me to pick up the phone when she called. I think she knows I’m pushing her away. She was already very clingy and used to call me every day to ask to hang out, so she still called a lot, just without an answer. \n\nI’m worried that if I directly tell her that I don’t want to be her friend that she would go back into a state of depression, because she got close to hurting herself last time. She missed about a month of school because of it. I’ve begun going to therapy too because all she is is a negative energy in my life. \n\n\nTo sum it up: I feel awful about trying to leave my friend who went through intense depression  recently but she started experimenting with drugs and I don’t want to put me or my future at risk.

I decided to send a message basically calling him out and asking if he took advantage of any girls/ got girls drunk recently.\n\n\nThe reason this rumor is believed to be true is because my girlfriend knows a couple girls that had a thing with this guy and have told her about how horrible he is. He asked his previous girlfriend to “take a break” only to have her walk in on him having sex with another girl. Even though this was just a rumor, he replied with a video of him screaming at the phone over and over saying:\n\n“WTF DID YOU JUST SAY!”\n\nMy first thought was if someone accused me of something like this and they weren’t true accusations, why would he respond in such an angry and defensive manner.

(I broke a rule so I fixed it and am reposting) \n\nMy aunt breeds Australian Shepherds. She's a responsible breeder that only does one litter a year, is very careful about lineage and breeding for health along with the typical pure bred traits. She does it as a side business and it helps pay for stuff around the farm and house that they wouldn't be able to afford to get fixed otherwise. She's also just an amazing hardworking woman. When I was nine/ten, she gave me (not sure if my parents paid or not- never asked) my first dog, who was my rock through various issues that come with a rough childhood. I was a kid and made mistakes, but I truly loved this dog and cared for her as best I could. She had to be put down about a year ago now due to age related health issues, and lived to the ripe old age of fifteen.\n\nMy BF and I are getting ready to move into a townhouse, and we'll be looking for an ESA for me for anxiety and depression issues, and as such I'm trying to get a dog that's under a year to make it easier with training. Here's where the issue comes in. I desperately want an Aussie again. The place we're going to has the backyard opening up into a park, and I'm working to keep to a strict schedule that would work with the high energy of an Aussie. Part of me fully believes in the \"adopt don't shop\" mindset, but the other part of me wants an Aussie again. I had thought of adopting from an Australian Shepherd rescue, but now I can't imagine telling this woman that gave me my first dog that I chose to get my next one from somewhere else. And honestly, with her skill in picking personalities of even puppies, I feel like she would be best for getting me a good match.\n\nThe compromise I came to was that once we're settled in and I've been able to faithfully stick to a schedule that would suit a high energy dog, I would go with whatever came up first- either she had a spare puppy that didn't get bought or a rescue Aussie that matched my needs came up. But in the end, if the rescue comes up first, AITA for getting a rescue instead of asking to buy a puppy from my aunt? I know she would save me a puppy from the next litter if I asked.",

I dont want any animals to be given away, but theyve been making me feel incredibly guilty about all of this.

She emotionally blackmails me constantly, saying how if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be where I am today.\n\nThis is mostly because her first husband(my biological father) was complete human garbage and it has affected her way of thinking about men and life in general.Luckily, she remarried a man when I was about 10 years old who is now my stepfather, who I am completely grateful for. But because of this, she feels that I owe her forever because she raised me when she quotes, \"I could have just left you to die with your father\"\n\nFast forward now at 25, I've been studying overseas in Australia for 3 years, and planning to stay because I really like it here. I was the one who tried to convince my parents for them not to send me to Australia because it was way too expensive and I didn't want my dad to be so financially burdened. But they told me they think I would have better career opportunities there. So here I am. I found a part time job and tried to helped my dad to reduce some bills like partially supporting two of my siblings who are also studying here with me. One of the major reasons for sending me over is so they can \"find a good husband\". I'm Asian, so I come from a relatively conservative culture. My parents prefer it I stick to my \"own kind\". I have many relatives here and my mother puts them on the pedestal as my cousins have managed to find good and rich husbands of \"their own kind\" and live such a happy life, so I should be like them. \n\nI'm dating an Australian man, who treats me well, respects me, supports me more than anyone I have ever dated regardless of race. My parents disapprove of him being alot older than me and they disapprove that he is not of \"my own kind\", claiming that Australians have high tendency to be abusive, rapists etc which I find complete and utter bullshit. After finding out I have been dating him for months, my mom confronted me and said I should break up with him and move to another state.

            "input": "This is a long story and it's a bit hard for me to describe the situation since there are lots if details  and I'm not going to omit info since details matter \nTL:DR at the bottom\n\nSo a little background. My work consists of me helping my dad on our own construction site. It's a pretty large construction site for the fact that there are few workers. Usually it's my Dad and an unskilled labourer. When I have a holiday I go to help him because I understand that he is working for me and my brother's future. Usually I go from 7 am-11 am (4 hours since I'm underage). In these Christmas holidays I've been going everyday except Sunday and Christmas. I didn't go for the last 2 days since I had to go do voluntary work for a school project. \n\nAnyway, yesterday I told my Dad that I didn't need to voluntary work tomorrow (which is today) so I can come to work he said he'll find me something to do. My dad pays me since he thinks that motivates me to come to work and I'm grateful. This morning I woke at 6:30 had breakfast and changed  my clothes to the concrete caked ones and rode my bike to the construction site it takes me about 5 minutes to get there at normal speed on my bike. On arrival I left my bike near the door and closed it and went inside the kitchen put on safety shoes and drank a glass of water.\n\n I went up stairs to the part if the building still being built and I found my dad and the unskilled labourer (Who was pretty new about 3 weeks) building the roof of a room. I asked my dad what I should do and he told me to take the scattered stones around the room near the buzzsaw. After, I helped the labourer take up a stone on his shoulder (about 30 by 8 inches of limestone) and he climbed onto the ladder to pass it to my dad. My dad told him not to lift it like that (from his back) and when I helped him lift it onto his shoulder again, my dad told me (in our language, the labourer was foreign) \"Has this guy never seen anyone lift a stone?\" I wasn't sure how to respond since I forgot the proper way to lift it too. Then he showed him how. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later he got a call from the guy we borrowed the material lift from that they were outside and came to get it. My dad said to me \"Already? We just have to lift these last few things and we will give it to them, go open the door for them.\" So I went downstairs and opened the door for them I couldn't see them clearly due to my -7 eyesight and me not wanting to break my glasses at work so I waved to them but when they didn't respond I taught they were the neighbours and got slightly embarrassed/awkward.  \"Come in\" I said but they must have heard \"Coming\" instead and said don't worry. I was confused so I went back upstairs and saw my dad and the labourer carrying the lift and then tying it up so we would lift it with the crane (Which was in the courtyard) onto the ramp were the truck with stones usually comes for deliveries. \"Go open the gate\" my dad said. The gate was locked from the outside so I had to go open. I opened the gate for the truck to go onto the ramp. \n\nMy dad then asked me from the 1st floor where the lift and room with roof they were working on where \"Did the truck come in?\" Why did he ask me this? Sound travels badly here so If I could hear him asking me this question he should be able to see the truck. I respond with a loud \"yes\" so that he can hear me. I went back upstairs and drove the tower crane with the lift onto their truck and proceeded to go back downstairs and close the gate. When I went back upstairs my dad asked me why I was shouting I told him so that he could hear me. He told me the I embarrassed him in front of the truck drivers by yelling and getting angry. What? He didn't even talk to them! I've been told I always sound angry which is probably true but what was I supposed to do! He asked me a question! \n\nWell whatever I brushed it off and went back to work. I started sweeping the floor off debris and stone dust into a wheelbarrow. While doing that I talked to my dad about something that popped into my head, \"I thought Noel (my brother) was coming with you guys tonight to the dinner of your friends? Is he coming with me to sleep at our grandparents? Did he change his mind?\" He then said \"Let him do whatever he wants.\" My dad then went to cut some stones in the other room with the buzzsaw. \n\nI continued sweeping the floor. Labourer comes in the room with a stone carrier and a stone on it and lays the stone on the floor.  He then stares at the ladder breathing heavily. Then after staring for about a minute at the ladder proceeds to move it to the side and also move the concrete bricks underneath to make the ladder higher. He then goes back out of the room. He then comes in with a new stone on the carrier and dies the same thing again. What? Why does he keep doing that? He didn't even use the ladder before. And instead of going round the pile of stone dust he proceeds to trample over it with the carrier and his himself. He did this last week too. This fucker. He can spend a minute staring at a fucking ladder but he can't waste a second to go round the pile I was sweeping. Ok I wasn't that angry since it happened before but I was annoyed. Whatever. He then comes back into the room with a new stone and proceeds to do the same thing minus the trample thing.\n\nWhat even is going on? I go to the other room. \"Dad, what was is it you told him to do? He keeps moving the ladder around.\"\n\"I told him to move the ladder so he can put stones instead of the ladder\"\n\"Why is he moving it each time he comes into the room?\"\n\"Every time you do this! Mind your own business, I'm in charge of him! This isn't school! Going to report people to the teacher.\"\nWhat the hell! Last time I did this was 5 months ago when a different labourer kept staring about and doing nothing when he could be doing something! \n\nI got the wheelbarrow I was filling with stone dust and debris took it to its room. I put my broom and shovel in the storage room and went downstairs. I checked my phone it should be 9 at least by now right? 8:20 and a missed call. It was mom, I called her back\n\"Honey, ask dad if he opened the garage so that the maid can come in and call me back with his answer\"\n\nSo I went and asked him.\n\"He said yes mom, also in coming home early\"\n\"Isn't there anything to do?\"\n\"Not really, bye\"\n\nMy dad always told me if you don't want to be here you can leave I'm not forcing you. I never did leave early since when I started in June since I felt guilty, even in days where it was 35°C and I was stuck driving the crane. \n\"Dad,I'm leaving\"\n\"Bored already?\"\n\"Yes\"\nIn my mind I rationalized there was no crucial work to be done and I would end up wasting time.\nI already felt terrible for leaving work early because i felt entitled and thought it would be awkward later today when he comes home.\n\nWhen I arrived home I heard Mom in her new office talking in the phone. Then I realised it was dad.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"DAHunter go get your laptop down here you're not allow to use it\"\n\"What? Why!\"\n\"Dad has been telling me how you yelled at him in front if the construction workers, reporting your brother and reporting the labourer!\"\nI couldn't help it, I yelled at her\n\"WHAT THE HELL HE IS MAKING STUFF UP I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT\"\nShe then got off the phone, my mom has a problem with stress and I felt bad for shouting.\nI then proceeded to explain my side if the story.\n\"DAHunter, you're racist! You always go report anything the labourers do wrong just because they are black!\" \nWhat has that got to do with anything?\n\"I don't hate black people mom! I hate idiots!\"\n\"That doesn't excuse you embarrassing your father!\"\nShe then shouted from across the house \n\"Noel! Get off your computer and come do your homework!\" (Noel is 12 and that's not his real name). \n\nI then went to take a shower for about 20 minutes. I still can't see what I did wrong. Maybe from their point if view I did something wrong because I'm easily angered. My shout sounds angry, My dad thinks I always pick on my brother even when he is not there and apparently I'm a racist and can't stand people. Sorry this was so long but I wanted as much if the story here since I'm not sure during which moment I was an asshole in.\n\nTL:DR My dad got mad at me at work for yelling and apparently embarrassing him and asking him what the hell the labourer was doing. I went home and he called my mom with a version that was to me, twisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It’s a fairly busy road and I wouldn’t feel too comfortable jumping into the road without looking due to a lot of bikes and buses on this road.

I was running on the “road” side of the pavement and made it very clear I was running towards the man, hoping he’d move. I was running fast and didn’t want to check the road behind and run round them. The man doesn’t move and I slow down till I’m right in front of him and shout at them “can you get out the way, im running ffs”. Their reply, “what?? Excuse me?!” was a reaction of bemused and anger and of a “I can’t believe someone actually shouted at us for not moving” tone. I ran past them having slowed right down to a walk, checked the road was clear and ran round them.\n\nI made it clear, to me atleast, that I was not expecting the woman to move her pram and that the man should move as I was running on his side of the pavement.

We are required to give 2 weeks notice, so that's exactly what I did. I explained to my boss that I'd found a better paying job elsewhere and would be leaving. He asked me why and I explained that it was simply due to my workplaces refusal to give me holiday time I was due.\n\nAs employees we're entitled to 4 weeks off a year, spanning from April to April. If you don't use them within that time period then you just lose them, but if you leave employment in that time you're entitled to be payed all the days you didn't take. I have three weeks. My job has a policy of only four people off at any one time, 3 employees and one manager. The problem is we're a building of 50+ employees so unless you get them all booked right away you'll always have people off on the days you want. \n\nNow you might be thinking 'well you should just book them earlier'. While you're correct in thinking that, I have to work around my parents schedules too, so when they go on vacations I come home and look after my younger brother and sister. I don't mind this, they're great kids so I'm happy to do it. \n\nAnyway, as I still have three weeks left and I ended up losing two weeks last year for the same reasons, I figured I could take two weeks off, be happy with that and just lose a week. Nope ,can't be done. My boss has told two others to take two weeks off so he has to say no to me, so he's doing me to lose paid time off the second year in a row.\n\nOkay so onto the meat of this tale. I got a new job, have handed in my two weeks notice and I start on the 18th of \nFebruary. My boss pulls my aside yesterday and asks if I'd be willing to go down to working one day a week until April, as it means he gets a £3,000 bonus for staff retention year to year. If I leave it means we've lost too many people and he doesn't get the bonus. I told my boss that I'd be happy to work one Saturday a week(my new job is Mon-Fri) until mid March on the condition that he gives me my three weeks paid vacation from March-April and that he not change my contract as it means id get paid less for the time taken off, as id be classed as part time from then on and wouldn't be paid as I would've before.\n\nI thought this was a fair request, given that I get paid for the time if I leave anyway, and this way we'd both still get what we want. Nope, my boss loses his sh*t, telling me I'm blackmailing him and what I was requesting was fraud and is illegal. Now I'm not a lawyer, I have no idea if thats true, it just seemed like an idea that I could leave and he'd still receive his bonus. I told him that if he didn't agree to that then I'd be leaving at the end of my notice period at that would be it. He stormed off and the only thing he's said to me since was a snide comment when my colleagues were talking about work he told me 'its not your problem anymore is it?' when I chimed in with a comment.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I The Asshole for how I 'blackmailed' my boss. I don't think I am to make it clear, but all his comments has really made me wonder.\n",

We talked about all kinds of things- our life experiences, plans for future, hobbies, and eventually sexual things. Soon though she had to go back to her own city,  so nothing really happened between us.(we didn't start to openly talk about sexual things until after this fact.)\n\nWe talked about things like our kinks, what we like, sometimes talk about whether or not we managed to get lucky, etc.\n\nLost contact with her over for a couple of years when I got into a serious relationship. After it ended early this year, I got back in touch with her to see if there was still some thing there. We tried a couple times to meet, and finally narrowed down a time for me to fly to her city. I checked in with her multiple times before I jumped on booking a trip and place to stay. Leading up to the month, she started sexting me heavier than usual. (Vids, dirty talk, etc)\n\nThe day before I was set to fly though, we talked about the phone and I could tell something was off. We talked about it, and she ended up wanting to cancel at the 11th hour. I respected that decision, but I had some airline credits I wanted to spend that would expire soon from my breakup. And there were places I wanted to check out in this city, so fuck it. C'est la vie.\n\nI knew she was into me though, and I was into her. But there was never anu discussion about what we are or exclusivity.  So I ended up hooking up with people I met at some classy lounges I really liked, and I told her about them when we talked about how my trip was going. She started making replies shorter. I could tell, tried to talk about it, but she kept blowing me off. (Again, we had history about talking times we got lucky. Nothing specific, but still.) So I just enjoyed the rest of my vacation.\n\nWell couple weeks later I reached ou to try to talk to her again,  to talk things out. Didn't work out, she wanted to stop talking, and she threw a couple of insults towards me. One of which was aimed about the fact that I hooked up with random people, which I never kept from her in the past.\n\nI personally think I dodged a bullet, especially since she aimed to insult something she never had a problem before in the past. But yeah, AITA for hooking up with other women knowing how she'd feel? Throwaway account.",

Her friend, Emma, moved in at the start of July with Anna, but Emma hadn’t yet signed on officially or paid the deposit (Anna had).

            "input": "First time here, sorry for any issues and this happened years ago so it is kind of blurry with what was said. This account is mainly for a game but I do sometimes branch off and can be considered a throwaway.\n\n\nContext: This happened in high school, I believe my second year with Friday's being a shorter day and during break time, there was a lot more on offer including hotdogs with the usual bacon rolls, sausage rolls and there was plenty of choices normally. I should also mention I have autism which is kind of vital.\n\n\nStory: One day, after one of my classes, I went to the canteen and waited in one of the three lines with it being for hot food. I was behind the deputy head and trying to look to see what was left since I was quite a bit behind and even said to myself \"I hope there is still some hotdogs left\" since I liked having a hotdog on Friday.\n\nThat was when the deputy head looked back and said \"There's nothing there for you\" and, due to my autism, I took it literally and just left the queue and went off to the extension of the school as that was where my next class was. I was never great with jokes and always took them literally like if someone said I was in trouble, I would believe it and be worried at what I did.\n\nAnyway, I'm now in my maths class after the bell went off and a few minutes into it, the deputy head knocks on the door and asks to see me. He wondered why I wasn't in the queue anymore and I explained to him that he said there wasn't anything there. He said he was just joking around and offered to let me go back to the canteen to go get something. I refused since, in my mind, there wouldn't be much I'd want and I would be wasting 5-10 minutes in a class I really struggled with plus I wouldn't be able to explain it.\n\nI should mention that, after the confrontation and him saying it was a joke, I did start crying, high school was hell for me so I guess it all piled up at the time and the deputy head did say for me to wait after class as they would get something for me. I didn't believe it considering his past action before I went back into class. I imagine people were looking at me but the teacher did give me some tissues and didn't ask me any questions.\n\nAt the end of class, I waited for a minute but he never showed up and so I had to rush to next classroom which was on the opposite side of the main school which was History. I believe 20 minutes into the class, the deputy head found it and walked over to give me a bag containing two different sandwiches, a bottle of water and some grapes.\n\nI got a lot of questioning looks and my friend asked what I got and I just said quietly as I put it next to my bag \"I don't know why I got this...\" but I never threw it away and after my last class, I just went home as it was the end of the day and aside from one sandwich, I did eat it all.\n\n\nHowever, thinking back on it recently, I really feel like I was in the wrong for taking a simple joke so seriously and I feel like I might have unintentionally guilt tripped the deputy head without realizing it. As for the deputy head, I think he knew I should have something to eat since it was a lot of time to go without anything to eat or drink so that was probably their reason (about 6-7 hours) but still...\n\nTLDR: I took a joke seriously and left the canteen without food. The deputy head told me it was a joke after taking me out of class and did offer solutions with me leaving class for time but I refused. They then said to wait after class but I didn't, thinking it was another joke and not trusting but he did give me a bag of food in my next class.\n\nAITA for that situation in the past?",

            "input": "Hey guys,\n\nI'll explain this as succinctly as possible. 5 months ago, my mom invited the son of an old friend of hers to move in to our house. We (my sister and I) don't know the family well, so we thought it was odd. \n\nAs the days went on, we started to learn more about him. He's a sweet kid, but he definitely has his flaws. For one, he's a 17 year old high school dropout. Not great, but it happens (this is how I rationalized it to myself). He also smokes a ton of pot. While it isn't that big of a deal, we haven't been happy with the stench. His room is putrid. It smells like a mix between rotten food and pot. My mother seems to have no issue with any of this for whatever reason. \n\nAll of that doesn't seem \\*that\\* bad, right? I didn't think so either until my younger sister recently filled me in on some of the underpinnings of his life. She has the room adjacent to his. The wall that separates the room is extremely thin, so she hears everything. Here's what she told me: \"I can hear EVERYTHING, Dreadcarrier. The drop of a pin, a whisper. So guess what I get to hear when he has his boyfriend over 3-4 nights a week? A lot of fighting, crying, and sex.\" She's a college student (as am I) so this really disrupts her sleep/work schedule. Once again, my mother brushes this off. She thinks she's doing something nice for the kid and that takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, there's more! My little sister follows him on Instagram. He has been posting pictures of himself \"tripping\" on my back porch! Not to mention the fact that he took a picture of himself using my sister's expensive Yeti cup as a gravity bong. All of this has her truly irked, and my mom thought she was overreacting (to the cup thing, not sure if she knows about the psychedelics). \n\nAnyway, I've been skeptical of this arrangement from the get-go. I never thought it was a good idea to remove a problem child from his (accepting of his sexuality but strict about his lack of achievement) family. Once I saw it was giving him the freedom to do drugs and continue to let himself fall into a hole, my suspicions were confirmed. I haven't voiced my concerns because it isn't my house or my business, but now it is affecting my sister's life. \n\nI plan on confronting my mother. I want to explain that what she is doing may seem like a good deed, but it isn't helping the kid in the long-term. He has no life structure, no authority making sure he is doing right. He also has no intention of going back to school and smokes pot all the time. Giving him carte blanche isn't what's best for him. I also plan on explaining that his presence is disrupting her successful child's life. It isn't fair to give her the short end of the stick because she works hard. She deserves to live in a quiet house where she feels comfortable. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I feel terrible and want some advice on how to handle the situation because I love my grandmother dearly. \n\nA little background information, I grew up living close to my grandma and seeing her several times a month. Shes the grandparent I would consider myself closest to. Around a year ago I moved out of state for school and am now around 2000 miles away, so I only see her a few times a year. Even still, I feel like our relationship is strong. My grandma lives in a tiny town that no one in my family lives near anymore because everyones jobs took them elsewhere. Because of this, she says shes lonely. She is single and has two cats. She got her cats about a year ago after her old one passed away and these cats are her life. She says they have separation anxiety and she cant leave them alone or with anyone else for more than three hours. She said they will stop eating and may try hurting themselves if she is gone for too long. She stopped visiting my father/mother (3 hours drive away) around six months ago and says they have to come to her because she can't leave her cats. That being said, shes mentioned leaving for day trips with her brother and sister before and says her neighbor is a trusted cat sitter who the cats are comfortable with. She has no physical disabilities and is only 70. She retired two years ago and still drives herself/goes shopping weekly/goes out with friends and siblings every time I talk with her. \n\nMy fiance and I just booked our wedding venue and are opting to have it in a location that is in between all of our guests. Everyone is spread out so everyone will have to travel a bit. When I told my grandma about this, she said she was sorry to hear I wasnt getting married within an hour or two of her and she would be unable to come. She said at first it was because she had no money. My father and I both told her we would happily pay for her transport , lodging, food, everything. It's that important to me she is there. Then, she said it was because of the cats. I asked if her brother or sister could take care of them for 1-3 days (they live ten minutes away) or if her cat sitting neighbor could help out. She said it wouldn't be possible because their lives would be put at risk. In my opinion, shes putting her cats over her granddaughter. It hurts badly and I cant understand why she is being like this.\n\nI told my father I think she may have a mental illness and if he had any ideas for help, but he and the rest of my family laugh it off and just say shes \"a crazy cat lady\". \n\nIt seems to me like she will not be attending, even though she is physically capable,financial capable with family assistance, has no other obligations, just is irrationally worried for her cats. I love my own cat dearly and can understand wanting it to be safe and comfortable while I'm away, especially if it has anxiety, but it seems like my grandmother may be projecting her own feelings of anxiety onto her pets.\n\nHolidays are coming and I cant help feeling upset about my grandmother. I feel almost angry towards her for deciding not to attend. I feel like I cannot mention the wedding at holidays if she is near because she is upset with me for having it more than an hour and a half away.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

He’s since left that job, but part of his agreement at his new position is that he is allowed to leave work early one day of the week (Wednesday) to pick his 12 year old daughter (from a previous relationship) up at school. \n\nOn Wednesday’s, he usually gets home around 3:45 instead of 5:30.

I'm very emotional right now and it's definitely affecting how I'm thinking right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: \n\nI got in a relationship with a girl I met online a little under a year ago. It's been pretty complicated. We never actually met, but that didn't stop me from becoming very attached to her. I had some trust issues and early on and ended up doing some snooping on her, I talked to her about it and we got in a fight and broke up but ended up getting back together later, it was rocky for a while but eventually we learned to get along and ended up making it work for a while. She's sick and has been for a long time. She ended up having to move in with her parents several months ago and our contact was strained during that time. We only talked a couple of times a week, she progressively got sicker and sicker over time but I stuck by her. Anything she needed I was there. I helped support her emotionally and financially. I really felt like I loved this girl. Eventually she even told me that once she got better she wanted us to live together, that she loves me more than I can possibly know for sticking by her side through the time she's been sick and waiting for her. My point here is that I felt very close to her and she felt very close to me. I've never felt so strongly about someone before. (I still believe everything she told me about her condition and I also have even spoken to her mother and her sister about it, I also believe that she did have feelings for me and even loved me). Onto the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeither of us use social media very much, so I never cared before, but recently I had suggested that we be friends on Facebook so I could send her messages from my work computer, she agreed initially but then backed down saying that her family was uncomfortable with it since her last boyfriend had harassed her and her family after they broke up. So she told me that she was going to hold off on it and I said that I understood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly though, this dealt a huge blow to my trust, I felt like she was trying to hide something from me. I'm not going to go into huge amounts of details, but ended up finding her LoL account info and looked up her match history. I found games dating months back, she was queuing with her friends nearly every day. Days that she said she was too sick to talk, days she said she was even in the hospital. This led me to believe that she was on alternate profiles, or marking herself offline on discord and the like, so she could sneak around behind my back and do stuff with her friends, and not have to do stuff with me. (She did this before when we were fighting, but I didn't think she'd do it when we were getting along fine).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called her today and confronted her on this. I did my best to maintain a level head, and gave her the opportunity to be honest with me first, and I told her that if she was honest with me that I was completely willing to forget about it. She flipped out at me and said that it wasn't her that she was letting a friend use her account. She told me I was a psycho for doing this again and that she was done and never to contact her again or she would \"fuck my life up\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's why I feel even worse about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into a conversation just a few days ago about us and we both reaffirmed to each other that we wanted to be together and that we loved eachother. She promised to be more proactive in contacting me and such. She followed through on this and for the past few days she was indeed talking to me more. Just this morning she called me just to wish me a good morning, and to tell me she loved me. That's when I brought up what I found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for snooping on her? Was it wrong of me to go seeking out her history? I feel like I shouldn't have ever brought it up, I feel awful like I've thrown away a year of hard work for nothing...",

Supposedly, this incident was extreme enough to make Rachel contemplate suicide that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring a robotics meeting it came up about myself and the other captain's college choices. I had said that I was accepted to school in Florida and, without missing a beat, Rachel fires out \"Make sure you don't remake Parkland!\" days after the massacre. I stormed out and found out that Alice ended up comforting Rachel. She constantly referred to me as her best friend to everyone under the sun, but she never acted like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was in the middle of packing to move. My family had decided that they were also going to move, with me, 2 weeks before the date I was planning to leave for school, on top of me working full-time, and insulted me for 'not packing enough', when I packed half the house. One day I snapped from all the pressure and went into my room with a blade. Nobody was answering my frantic messages or pleas for help, except Alice. I called her about twenty minutes later, in tears, and begged for help. She laughed and hung up the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day, I'm talking to one of my robotics buddies. Talk turns to the roster. Alice quit. Turns out she's drinking, smoking, and bulimic again as a type-1 diabetic - essentially a death sentence. After thinking about it, all I could say was, \"good riddance\", in the hopes that she could never hurt someone again like she hurt me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My 'best friend' from high school whose life I saved multiple times laughed at me when I called her - suicidal - and hung up to leave me to die. I found out that she is a smoking, bulimic, alcoholic diabetic, and said \"good riddance.\"\n\nReddit, Am I The Asshole?",

For the most part M is cool but she can get really dramatic and aggressive over the smallest things, and my friend has lost all romantic feelings for her. T has told me that he's only with her at this point for the sex.\n\nNow he's been getting serious with A (going to her house, kissing, I don't think they've fucked tho) but he still hasn't broken up with M. I've been clear with him that at this point its hardcore cheating and he should just end things with M to avoid any serious repercussions. He says that he'll do it but he has pussied out many times.\n\nJust now M texted me and asked me to keep something between us. I think it would have been better if I stayed out of it completely but stupidly I said yes. She then told me about how she thinks he's cheating on her because she saw some messages on his phone coming from A. I played dumb and said she was overthinking things, and that A was just a friend.\n\nShe explicitly told me not to share any of it with T, but honestly he's my one of my best friends. I may not agree with his decisions but I'll back him up no matter what. The way I see it, my loyalty ultimately lies with him and not M. So of course I sent him screenshots of the convo to basically say \"hey, she knows. Time to end it man.\"\n\nWell he ended up calling her, and he mentioned some things that were in the screenshots that I sent, so she figured out that I ended up telling him. She confronted me about it but I denied everything and left it at that.\n\nSo in conclusion, was I wrong to lie to her and break her trust?

Ex was devastated when I cut her off. The story happened 3 days b4 ex’s birthday and when on birthday her friend called me on whatsapp saying ex was having a breakdown and needed me to comfort her, I hung up and blocked that friend’s number. Gf made things worse by updating her IG and I let that slip too. AITA?\n\nWhen I went to college I started dating a girl from my study group and... well, it’d been a rocky relationship to say the least. I’ll elaborate in last in comments, if needed but for now I believe this info isn’t crucial for the story.\n\nEnd of year 6 and I meet the other girl. We went to the bar once, next day I went to business trip in which I decided to dump my gf for good which was long overdue and then take a shot with that girl. The day I come back I break up with ex and she handles this surprisingly well, not crying or screaming as I expected but wishing me good riddance. Three years later I date the new girl who seems perfect in every way.\n\nAnyway, since our breakup was amicable, I didn’t cut off my ex like I used to do. We kept texting and she would often call me to have a chat. I never planned to get back together because I was more than happy with my gf, but out of respect for the six years I kept helping her during her breakdowns, consoling ger when she was complaining about how she will never find another boyfriend and she wants to love like it’s her favourite song and I talked her through it. My gf knew I dated someone for 6 years and she knew I’m on good terms with my ex and I thought it was ok because she herself remained friends with her ex and it never made me jealous. She never knew the nature of our conversations with ex though. \n\nLast week I went out for snacks leaving gf alone at my apartment and when I came back she was unhappy to say the least. Turns out, I left my laptop open and she saw an incoming message from an ex with sonething like ‘I’m feeling blue again, let’s talk’. She dug through our message history and said that she thinks I’m still up to smthng w/ my ex because we speak very intimately. I said that theres nothing sexual/romantic going on between us but she didn’t believe and said she needed time think it over.\n\nNext day we met and she said she was really into me to the point that she surprises herself, so she is willing to give me benefit of the doubt on condition that I stop communicating with ex whatsoever. Not even asking anything work-related (we’re employed in similar fields). I agreed. She was surprised, saying I knew her for a few weeks and I’m already forgetting about a girl that I loved for 6 years. I said that my ex is my past and my gf is my present and hopefully future. She seemed still confised but we decided to give it another chance. Then she also asked me to tell my ex I have a new gf before cutting her off. I said I was hesitant to do it because it would wreck her. She saud she “couldn’t give two flying turds about what [my] ex would feel as well as [I] didn’t give two turds about [her] feelings while calling [my] ex pet names”. I reluctantly agreed. \n\nNext time my ex called me I told her I had a new GF and boy did it go bad. She started crying and calling me a jerk and saying my gf is ugly (I didn’t tell her the name but her friend probably told her who that was after seeing us together in a parking lot). I said I no longer want to contact her and hung up. That was January 23rd. Her birthday is on Jan 26th. And it was also the Homecoming day in our college. I couldn’t attend but I dropped my girlfriend off and when she went out to get tea, I wandered around the hall to say hi to people I knew. Now, to make it clear. They had some kind of a concert so everyone sat down at the conference hall. I noticed a guy I went to hockey team with, sitting in the seat on the edge and started small talk with him. What I didn’t notice was that my ex was sitting just behind him. When my girlfriend entered, she saw me going down the stairs from my ex’s general direction. She didn’t say anything but the seat behind my ex was empty and gf used that opportunity to sneak on her texting.\n\nIt went like this. \nEx, texting me: why did you ignore me? It’s my birthday and you didn’t even congratulate\nMe: I didn’t see you\nEx: I was waiting for you so much, I even wrote a poem to you\nMe: Stop, Holding. That. Against me.\nEx: Ok, I’ll get to the caffeteria  now.\nMe, still in the building, thinking of a cup of coffee to go: which one?\nEx: the one on the 2nd floor.\n\nSo I avoid 2 floor and get coffee on ground floor. That was all our messaging. When I pick up my gf from the Homecoming, she’s infuriated. She is screaming because she saw my texts to ex and we made an agreement before that. I’m trying to say that I was trying to get off the convo and there’s a good reason I used iMessages - cause she is blocked everywhere else. GF don’t wanna hear, she says it didn’t look like rejection and was all like  “You. Talked. To. Her.” It took me three hours to convince her not to cut our relationship right here and by that moment we were in my apartment and 1 hour later had consensual make-up sex. \n\nBefore we ended arguing, she said that she doesn’t want me to talk to my ex in any circumstances at all, not even telling her to get away from me. So, she is in the shower and I get a phone call from my ex’s roommate and she’s like “OP, it’s [ex name] birthday and she can’t stop crying because of you, could you please talk to her for a while?” I said no and hung up and blocked her number. Then I received an e-mail fron ex’s address saying she just wants to talk it out one last time so she’s comin to my place. \n\nThis is where my girlfriend comes out of the shower asking who called me and I tell her everything as is. Then I unblock the roommate and ask her to convince my ex not to do that because I’m not there and it’s a remote suburb area and she doesn’t know the address cause I only recently moved in. Roommate says ok. Girlfriend, knowing ex is stalking her IG takes a snap of the view from my window, posting it with a location (and nobody else me or ex of gf know lives here) and writes “this is gonna be one hot night”. When I asked her why would she do that, she said that my ex’s behavior made her cry so she’s gonna make her cry twice as hard. I should have been bothered by that and her reading my messages (she herself admitted that was messed up), but I just couldn’t bring myself to, despite her behavior deeply hurting the person I loved for 6 years. \n\nAITA for the way I treated my ex?\n\n\n",

Only, I made the mistake of asking her to \"hang out\" instead of explicitly asking her on a date. She said yes, but the next day I found out that she did have a BF. I thought \"that's fine, she's a cool person and I like having friends.\" We didn't hang out, though, and I never persued hanging out with her outside of work again. I did feel like I had caught a bit of the feely feels, but I figured I'd get over it and things would be kosher. I know a lot of women who I value as friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut we did talk a lot. Our positions at work caused us to spend a lot of time together talking alone. The more I got to know her, the more and more it became obvious that we had some pretty bonkers stuff in common. Tons of stuff in common. I started to feel like I had never met anyone like her before. I fell for her pretty hard, and I was in way over my head emotionally before I realized it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, she left that job, but we kept in touch over FB messenger pretty often. My feelings grew to the point where I just couldn't get her out of my head. I became very, very depressed and started seeing a therapist for the first time in a long time. It highlighted the fact that I depend too much on others for happiness. I felt like I had to disconnect from her, and that there was no way for us to be friends without it being a toxic, one-sided thing. I didn't want to feel like I was leading her on in a friendship way for too long, and I felt like it would be best for both of us if we weren't friends while I tried to work on my co-dependency issues and my obsession with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she was already involved with someone and she seemed happy with what she was doing on that end, I didn't want to tell her about my feelings. So I unfollowed her on Facebook and became less responsive on messenger, and I eventually quit responding, hoping she would get the hint. I felt like she was owed an explination, but I didn't think I should tell her about my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut one day, she texted me, agressively asking for an explination.

Then she blocked me on all social media platforms that we followed each other on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a month ago, and I am crushed.

I really had no idea what to do that wouldn't end with one of us getting hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that my fixation on her indicates that I have some serious soul searching to do to improve myself as a person, but I feel like I tried the best I could to what was best for me while also doing what was best for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I lost my bank card and I’m waiting on a replacement so I text her this morning saying “can you put gas in and I’ll transfer you money”.

I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can’t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn’t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it’s been getting much worse and it’s clear she’s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different).

Also that she doesn’t want to be like this but she’s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I’m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn’t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there’s something wrong with her but it’s not like she can’t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people’s tables. I told her that and I don’t understand why this is any different; it’s not socially acceptable to take other people’s property regardless of what’s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven’t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I’m trying to be nice.

I don't drink, so I don't understand the near-constant need to drink. \n\nWhenever we go out around someone's birthday, it ends up as \"We're paying for X's dinner, because it's their birthday.\" Well, this burns me for a few reasons. First is that my friends make a LOT more money than me, but secondly, they always pick something expensive, where I can barely afford food for me, much less an appetizer, drinks, and an entree for the birthday person. Third, it's always something I won't eat. 95% of the time, it's Asian. I'm limited on what I will eat because it will give me bathroom problems if it has too many spices. I'm limited to white rice and a bland meat, with salt and pepper. I do eat other things, and regret it later. An example of this was a friend chose Asian seafood for her birthday. I checked out the (expensive) menu and found one thing I could eat safely, teriyaki chicken and white rice. Birthday girl chose a family-style meal which started at $100, and contained literally NOTHING I could have. So I would've been paying upward of $40 after food, drinks, and tip for food I can't have. \n\nAnother thing is that we have different schedules. I work nights and they all have regular 9-to-5 jobs. When asked when were available to hang out, I'll give them a time, it's agreed on... then changed so I can't make it. This time, I suggested breakfast, because they I can go home to sleep, which THEY AGREED TO, then just today, they've changed it to a liquid lunch and karaoke and then a hard lunch, probably on an Asian place, based on the neighborhood. \n\nI feel like an asshole, mainly because they tell me I am. They tell me I don't try (which is bullshit, I think, as I try many cuisines because I like to eat, and I want to know what I CAN'T eat), but it seems like they're outvoting me as a group to do what the majority wants. Which isn't a problem, I just don't understand why they ask when everyone can make it, then change it so I'm the ONLY person who can't make it. \n\nI made it a New Year's resolution to try to see my friends more, but this situation made me realize exactly WHY I don't like to see them. They always make me feel excluded, mainly because I can't afford to do the things they do (they all just had a spa day together that I found out about via whatsapp), and say \"That's okay, you don't have to come.\" \n\nI feel like, with the spa day, and everything else, just stop inviting me. Hell, I've been trying to extricate myself from these people for years, and it always comes down to \"/U/notastepfordwife, you're not trying, you're kinda selfish, but we love you.\" I feel like, if I'm the asshole, they wouldn't want to be around me, either, right? But they want to hang out, and I keep doubting myself. I know I'm an asshole in some respects, but is this one on me? Am I just not doing all I can to be a good friend?\n\nHelp me out, here.

I started asking her when she's pay me back, and she was kind of snotty about it and said that it was my problem. I was upset and started asking her everyday, and she one day waved a 20 in front of my face at work and then said that if I stopped mentioning it, I'd get paid. I did, and still nothing. I've started making snappy remarks back and leaving notes for her about it, and my friends have asked her about it too. She complains that we're too annoying and she should take more money because I'm stressing her out whenever I mention it, but she's still annoying herself about it. AITA?",

Whenever somebody close in the family falls I'll or something bad happens, Im always the last person to find out, and it's always from somebody else. When I was at university, she failed to tell me for months that my nan had been diagnosed with cancer. This was the first time (to my knowledge) she'd done this, and where my issue with it all started. She said it was so that I wouldn't get stressed during my exams, which I can understand, but I explained to her that it was my nan and I had a right to know, and for future reference could she please tell me as I didn't want her to bare the burden alone. We're all family. She agreed. Fast forward a year and my nans cancer has taken a turn for the worst I get that this is her mother and she had her own coping system, but the only reason I found out was because my step brother told me. I chose to not say anything about her breaking her promise and consoled her as much as I could.\n\nThere have been other little things here and there after this, like my stepdad having a stroke and my brother's telling me, but I'm going to fast forward past this to last year. I was walking in the street of my old hometown and bumped into an old friend of the family and got chatting. After all the formalities, I was asked how my mom was doing now and if she was feeling better. Absolutely dumbfounded I asked what he meant, it turned out  that she'd had troubles with her womb and needed to have a hysterectomy, but they couldn't operate on her because she'd also had some issues with circulation in her legs and had a bad blood clot and some other issues (my memory of the whole ordeal is hazy and everytime I asked mom about this she'd always tell me it was nothing and not to worry). So after I confronted mom about not telling me this, I got the usual didn't want to worry me, and it wasn't that big a deal etc etc. I did lose my shit a little bit with this one, because as her only child I should be made aware of these things and how would she like it if I withheld information like that from her. \n\nShe then apologised and again told me that she would let me know for future reference. In her defence, she did keep me up to date with what was going on with her for a while, and gave me dates when she had her hysterectomy surgery so I was there for her and gave all the support I could. However, after the surgery she failed to tell me the one thing I worried would happen, that during the surgery her bladder got perverated and caused her to be incontinent. She tried to keep this from me for weeks until my stepdad told me. I again tried to have a stern but fair conversation with her. She's not been able to work nearly a year now while she's been on the waiting list to have repairation surgery, but did keep me up to date with appointments again.\n\nFast forward to today and I've just received a call from my step brother telling me that she's had her surgery today but hasn't came out yet. He's at the hospital waiting for her. To give you insight. My step brother (her husband's son) lives in Amsterdam, we live in the UK. He knew and came all the way over here a few days earlier from Christmas so he could see her, and I find out because he tells me. \n\nI'm getting fed up with it now, I'm always the last to hear about anything and I want to be there for my family, and it hurts that I'm always kept in the dark about this stuff. I'm going to the hospital after work to see her but it's going to take all my willpower to not lose it. Reddit, AITA for being selfish about this?",

            "input": "I am a freshman in college and it's important to find ways to cope with this stress. While I didn't plan it, one of my ways ended up being fish. Specifically my pet comet goldfish. How I got her is important to the story, as I didn't go out and buy a goldfish that, for those of you who don't know, grow to be quite a large size. Instead, I got her through my zoology class. One of our first labs involved fish and when the lab was over, there were about 30 goldfish in need of re-homing. I wasn't going to get one, I really wasn't...but then I did, which I fully admit was an impulse decision as I hadn't done my research first. Long story short, a single comet goldfish requires a tank size of at least 55 gallons for when they're full size. Campus rules say you can't have an aquarium larger than 10 gallons, so I currently have her in that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did my research after getting her and I'm taking as good of care of her as I can. I have everything except a big enough tank that I would happily purchase if I was allowed to have it. She's healthy and I've owned her for a few months now. The fish and fish care are incredibly stress relieving for me, even the tank cleaning is relaxing. There are days when I come home from a long day of classes and stare at her swimming around for hours to unwind myself. This is where I find myself asking the question, \"am I an asshole?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know she will need a bigger aquarium soon. She has plenty of room right now because she's a baby, but she'll grow. Many people on the fish subreddits say to re-home your goldfish if you can't provide the perfect home for them, either to someone else or to a local fish store. However, I do not know anyone who lives off campus who would take a goldfish, and I refuse to leave her at home for my family to take care of, both because I know they won't do as good a job as I do with the cleaning, and because it's not fair to dump that responsibility on them. There is no local fish store where I live, and I have no car to travel to somewhere that does. Even if I did have a store to give her to, she's a 40 cent goldfish, not an exotic fish. They most likely wouldn't take her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, she's a rescue fish who's getting a better life than she normally would have seeing as she was a disposable \"lab rat\" fish who would have died otherwise. I really enjoy having her and I plan on buying a 55 gallon as soon as I have my own place, and if she were to die before that, I would not replace her since I now know I can't house one correctly here. That being said, I still want an unbiased opinion from people who aren't me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this isn't the typical AITA post, and I hope I don't come across as fishing for attention (pun intended).

But there's one thing that bothers me, and that's the fact that she really doesn't like it (gets upset) when I play video games. \n\nWe have alternating and crazy schedules so she usually opens and I work in the afternoon or close if I'm not at class. I generally try to schedule my game time around her schedule while she is either at work or asleep so that it doesn't bother her, and so I also get to hang out with her while she is awake. And when I say game time, it's not like 40 hours a week of gaming. I average 3-4 hours on nights that I get to play, which is generally every other night and excluding weekends. I explicitly reserve weekends for us to be together. So like, 10-12 hours a week. Some crazy nights I will pull a 7 hour night from 8pm-3am, but that is very rare. \n\nPersonally, I need my space to wind down. I work pretty much full time and I'm also a full time college student. I also try to go to the gym 4-5 times a week. I don't feel like in a serious relationship living together that you need to spend every second of down time with your SO, but that is just my opinion. \n\nI think what upsets her is that she really doesnt have any friends to hang out with or hobbies, so when I'm not home she's generally just watching Netflix, tidying up, or napping. I've invited her to learn how to play video games with me and even slapped together my old build so that she could try it out, but she hasn't even given it a shot.\n\nBut even though I try to not do my gaming when she is at home/awake, she still gets upset. She feels like I am just waiting for her to go to bed now so that I can play video games, which isn't the case. If I were to be gaming when she came home from work and something trivial wasn't done (a few dishes in the sink, laundry not put away, etc.) she would get upset that I chose to play video games instead of completing those tasks. That's fair, but on the flipside of that, I regularly come home to tasks not being completed while she is watching Netflix. I sort of feel like there are double standards that only really come out when it has to do with me gaming.\n\nSo the golden question, am I the asshole for wanting some alone time to play video games with friends? I don't feel like my gaming is getting in the way of our relationship. Personally I think that right now she is upset that we don't get to see each other as much as she wants to because of our wacky schedules, and is using video games as the reason for it. But if I am in the wrong here, I would definitely like to know about it so I can change.",

One of them is quiet, the other speaks loudly but turns it down when asked to, and the last one is a guy who thinks he can do whatever he pleases.

SO thinks I'm NTA because I didn't effectively kick him out, and that I shouldn't put up with him; friends or not, he's being disrespectful and obnoxious.\n\nI'm really annoyed by this situation and no one satisfies my moral discomfort.

Like lets say you started a company with someone, but you didnt know them that well, youd give them equity gradually after theyve been with the company awhile. That way they dont just claim ownership and then leave the first week without contributing.\n\nIn this case the CTO of my company had a vesting schedule of 4 years, with his cliff at 1 year. So this means if he is with the company a year, he immediately receives 25% of his equity. So if his equity is 20%, he receives 5% ownership right there.

            "input": "This happened in the last couple years but I am still bothered by the results.   \n\n\nI have a great relationship with my husband and his immediate family.   My mother in law (Theresa) in particular is a classy and really fantastic person.  She loves me very much and frequently says she is glad her son found me.   \n\n\nMy mother in law has a sister, my husband aunt (we will call her Betty).  Betty and Theresa had a falling out years ago. Betty rather painfully cut out Theresa and my husband from her life.  Betty loved my husband dearly but didn't want a relationship with her sister so she cut them off entirely.  This falling out was related to hard feelings of competition between the sisters and then resentments about their mother's estate. Theresa doesn't have other family so this hurt everyone.  My husband was a child and it hurt that his loved aunt wouldn't see him.   \n\n\nMany years later Betty is getting married to Clara. Clara is a lovely woman and wants to help Betty get back together with her family.   Everyone reconciles and we start going to Betty and Clara's home once a month for a \"family game night\". While things are reconciled, they are still tense. Betty has a pretty volatile personality with some temper issues. Theresa still feels cautious and hurt. My husband wants things to work, but mostly for his mothers sake.  People usually like me because I am a pleasant people-pleasing sort of woman. Clara loves me but Betty treats me from the start as an outsider.  Betty is a staunch conservative who is ex-military.  (Ironic because she is a lesbian right?)  My husband and I are liberal. My husband is much more liberal than I am and has made me more liberal than ever.   While we rarely discuss politics, it comes up in the course of the kind of games we are all playing together.  Each time Betty gets mad about our viewpoints it becomes obvious that she blames those viewpoints on me ... not her darling nephew, my husband.   \n\n\nFast forward to 2 years of family game nights. Things are tense. Betty doesn't like me and it is obvious. I am an approval seeker so I handle this by becoming very quiet and not participating as much. I have social anxiety and this tension made it terrible. I will be honest.  I didn't want to go any longer.  My husband and I had arguments over it. I would say that she didn't like me.  He would say that is just how she is.  I would talk about tone of voice, body language and facial expressions.  He would not see those things. I wanted his mother to have the relationship she craved with her sister and I wanted him to be able to see his aunt.  I felt guilty and yet hated being forced into these monthly interactions.  I went anyway and isolated myself at these events more and more. I didn't ignore anyone but I stopped being my gregarious friendly self and would stay off in a corner alone on my phone.   \n\n\nWe are expected to RSVP for game nights.  Two times over the 2 years ... I RSVP late. This infuriates Betty. My husband doesn't face book.   The first time the late RSVP happens he tells her that it shouldn't be my job to do this anyway.  He would prefer to do this over the phone with her.  She refuses and insists on using face book and states that it should be my job to manage our social engagements because I am the woman.   \n\n\nThe second time I didn't RSVP fast enough she could see that I had seen the invite ( I was too busy to respond when I opened it and then forgot for a week).   When she lost her temper again at me.  She never talked to me if she could help it so she vented this rage to my husband and I heard of the problem second hand. I told my husband that since the schedule had changed I was having a harder time keeping track of the dates.  I apologized and RSVPed and messaged her to tell her I had forgotten. My husband, making an assumption, thought this meant I hadn't seen the RSVP at all and told his aunt that is why I missed it. She lost her mind.  She said to my MIL that I am a terrible person. She felt that I lied to my husband and I was a bad partner.  She could tell that I had seen it because face book told her it was viewed. She knew that I was deliberately ignoring her and then lying to my husband to say I had not seen it! She thought that I was disrespectful to not RSVP and she never liked me.  My mother in law started to defend me.  She told her that I was a trustworthy and really good partner for her son.  She explained that Betty really had not gotten to know me like she had.  She said that a couple missed RSVPs in 2 years was no big deal.   \n\n\nThe fight between them escalated with Theresa defending me.  My husband and I were told and I said that I wouldn't stop them from seeing her but I no longer would go under any circumstances. My MIL said that she wouldn't go either and my husband said the same. I told them both that I didn't intend to stop them from seeing Betty.   Even though they each had issues with her ... Betty was much nicer to them than she ever was to me and I felt that each had a bit of a relationship with her they liked.   They said that if I wasn't going, they weren't and agreed that Betty was unreasonable.   \n\n\nI still feel guilty.   I got what I really wanted ... which was to not go there any more and deal with this unpleasant aunt-in law.   However, I watched a budding reconnection between sisters get destroyed. My MIL still misses her sister though she directs all of her anger at Betty, not me.   I feel terrible for being the point of contention that made this attempt to reconnect fail.  I feel like if I had been able to get along better with Betty, perhaps not reacted by withdrawing ... perhaps I could have made this relationship better.   \n\n\nTLDR: AITA for failing to make this relationship strong enough to work and being the point of break up of the relationship between my MIL and her sister? My aunt-in-law is a difficult person to get along with, but if it had not been for this conflict she would still be interacting with her sister and my husband. ",

            "input": "I apologize that this is *extremely* long.\n\nSo he's not my roommate any more. He moved out last week.\n\nHe was and is a great friend, and we'd known each other for years. We were pretty tight and he knows probably more scarring secrets about me than any other person on the planet. He came from an abusive home life where was homeschooled, had information like his SS card and birth certificate hidden and withheld, his dad held him emotionally captive, and his step mom was verbally and physically abusive. Prior to moving in with me, he stayed in the adjacent house belonging to his dead grandmother, with no plumbing or electric. He's from way up north.\n\nA few years into our friendship we resolved that when I got my own apartment in my current town, the stars aligned; it wasn't instant, but I moved him down here, much further south. I helped him get his paperwork in order to get the documents necessary for job hunting.\n\nDisclaimer: I've never lived with a roommate outside of family and one year of college. It does not suit me, I do not like it, and I appreciate my privacy. I've not been in a relationship for more than a decade. I'm 27 now. He knows all of this.\n\nI moved him in anyway, out of a brotherhood and deep friendship. We'd never actually met face to face, so I cautiously added him as an additional occupant rather than another party to the lease. This protected me, but it also gave him the benefit of ignoring rent aside from just paying it to me.\n\nWhen he moved he didn't have a job; it took four months. I paid for those first four months, rent and food and utilities for the both of us. I also helped him get his job, just a mere ten minute walk away (he can't drive). I'm not trying to get points. I'd never ask for repayment, but I feel it's important for the ensuing events.\n\nWe agreed he would simply pay half rent, no utilities, and could help with the groceries later. In exchange he did the lion's share of the chores and cooked (something no one wants me to do). Rent went up $25 and I just didn't bother making adjustments. Utilities only amounted to about $150 all told, so I ate the costs.\n\nChores: He washed the dishes because without him there wouldn't be a mess to wash, and he was paying less for exactly this purpose. When he moved in there was a flea problem as well as a roach problem, so he was also vacuuming every day. As the fleas got under control, he vacuumed once or twice a week, and then stopped entirely. The roaches also got under control, and then he got lax about doing the dishes and leaving trash in his room (both things I explicitly discussed with him long before he moved in). We did the laundry as needed, and I take care of all cat related chores and costs (I have two).\n\nAll was fine until he started seeing this girl. He'd started getting lax already, but when they started talking it really went downhill. He grew increasingly distant and would chat with me briefly and then lock himself in his room for hours talking to her every night. Before I said something about the volume he never even shut his door.\n\nFirst she constantly wanted me to text her as well, and chat, and we'd all be friends. That's just not my personality, nothing against her. Then I'd be going out the door to work and she'd be meeting me at the door to come in. Then she'd be there when I got home. This happened a couple of times before I set some boundaries. I said some stuff about not wanting her to be here all the time. I have a tone problem I've been told. One day they weren't here so I texted to see if they were coming home with a lighthearted joke about being able to strip down and do whatever if they weren't, which apparently made her uncomfortable (even though I didn't text her) because I'd been so cold leading up to all of this. Then they got here and my roommate made her stand outside in 30 degree weather under the assumption I didn't want her inside at all, which I clarified was not the case. He came to get her things, but when I told him they could come the fuck inside because of course, it's freezing, they went into his room, shut the door, and stayed there for 4 or 5 hours until about 1AM. I worked the next day, and it's a small apartment.\n\nSo I clarified my rules.\n\nThey were simple rules, maybe a bit strict. Basically it was just \"be mindful of my schedule, don't have her here for ages if I'm going to be home, and don't have sex on the cats (a real rule I added to express what I thought was the levity of the situation...and also I didn't want to clean splooge off of my cats)\". These were never respected to any real degree. She just ended up being here one specific day a week (a work day for me, so I got to come home to it) until about 1AM each time. I never said anything about it directly, but my frustration probably showed.\n\n*Then* things got a little more tense, about a month later. I was sick one day, and he made dinner shortly after I woke up in the evening. The evening before was her usual evening, and they were together the whole time locked in his room until the usual time. While I was preparing to eat, unshowered and looking a mess, he lightly and happily added that she was also on her way over because she wanted some of his tortellini. Well I lost my cool, snapped, and told him that it was inconsiderate and I was going to go take a shower. He didn't understand *why* I thought it was inconsiderate, and neither did I. He told me I didn't have to get ready or anything just because she was coming over. I disagreed. I later realized the reason I was upset was because he never even thought to ask; he just invited her. He doesn't need my permission, but that had just been our relationship up to that point. The jury was still out on whether I thought any of that was fair.\n\nAnyway I sulked in my room, and didn't speak to anyone (pretty much no different than any other time they were here except I wasn't sulking). Finally he opens the door and tells me she wants to talk. I don't want to talk, and tell him as much. He repeats his statement, I say \"[Roommate], I don't want to talk to [GF] right now\". I need time to think through my emotions, or I say things I don't mean or haven't processed fully. A few seconds later she barges into my hallway adjacent to his room and starts going off about how I have a problem and we're going to discuss it. I just continued sitting at the computer, looking away from her and doing my thing while she rambled on, getting frustrated. Occasionally I'd reiterate that I didn't want to talk right now. Didn't matter.\n\nEventually she gets me to crack and I spout off a laundry list of problems I have, largest of them being the slacking off of chores (in private I also explained to my roommate that when I'm here I'd rather they be playing Smash Bros. together in the living room than locked in his room fucking, or taking showers together). As I listed off my problems she'd give me a sassy \"mhm?\" and repeated this about 7 or 8 times. Finally I stopped complaining and simply said that \"her sassy 'mhm's?' weren't doing her any favors and the longer she went on the less I wanted her here at all\". That ended the conversation, and later she apparently cried. I was fully prepared to not speak to my roommate until after my pre-planned vacation, but he was amenable the next night, and we talked it out. He also talked it out with her, and it didn't go as smoothly behind closed doors. Full disclosure, I 100% eavesdropped on the conversation against my better judgement.\n\nAll I asked him to do was watch my cats while I was gone for the week. They were free to stay here and do whatever. I also found this an appropriate time to raise his rent from $400 to $500. I didn't do this solely as a punishment, though; I did it in exchange for doing *all* the chores. I would clean, wash dishes, and deal with the miscellany on top of what I already did. He told me he thought he should *only* pay half. So I calculated it for him.\n\nThings went on pretty much the same after I got back, except I never saw his GF again. Period. It went back to talking on the phone, except this time much earlier, and for much longer. He pretty much stopped cooking or doing anything outside of his room. Then he told me he was moving out, last week. He had applied for a job and had an interview; if he got it he was going to move out. I didn't realize the urgency in all this when he said it. I literally did not see him again after he told me he had the job. He stayed over at her place for several days, did a few more interviews...and then I got an email from my property manager saying he'd removed himself from the lease. An hour later he texted me and told me he wanted to give a proper goodbye but \"needed to get early rates on the apartment\" as if he couldn't move his stuff after signing the lease, and had moved all of his stuff out; he can't drive, so he just wasn't going to go to his last few shifts for his old job. The only job he's ever had. He had to pay the security deposit so he had to split his payments. He'd already paid me half earlier in the month before he mentioned anything, and then paid $150 with the breakup text he sent me. Conveniently he only paid $400 the one month he'd been asked to pay more. And like that he was gone. He asked me to hold his mail.\n\nWe exchanged some words after this all settled in, and, well, frankly ESH for the texts. Basically I just wanted more time; he'd needed a month if he was on the lease! That's after the fact, though. It hurts having to suddenly make up for $400 a month I didn't have to worry about, and it hurts that he basically did all of this behind my back. Mostly I just feel betrayed, but I'm not sure how at fault I am for the way this has all played out. My parents, friends, and coworkers are of course biased and they don't want to read 10,000 character",

Our mom got diagnosed with cancer after 6 months and 2 years later she died. I still live alone in the other country.\n\nHer illness had different effects on the both of us. I had a lot of time with my mother and it allowed me to make peace with our limited time, but my life became really hard since I had to do a lot on my own and don't have a family near me that can support me, I am over stressed and am in the process of dropping out of (high?) school.\n\nI imagine that our moms death came fast for Rachel, but her life seems stable enough. I do know that she has a lot of emotional trouble, not a lot of friends and has problems with my father (he has the tendency to always complain about our mother, hurray) but she is economically supported and is encouraged to discover the world. She has one more year to go before she finishes college.\n\nPeople always had the tendency to compare us (as any other siblings) but it was terrible last summer. Rachel seemed reasonable happy, was having fun and just generally in a good mood, while I didn’t know who I was anymore, felt like a complete and utter failure and I thought daily about commiting suicide. People saw that I wasn’t happy and wanted to cheer me up by pointing out how Rachel and I are the same. It only made me feel worse since the things they said weren’t correct.\n\nFast forward 2-3 months, I made it a point to concentrate on myself and find my own passions / hobbies (Rachel and I shared a lot of hobbies when we were younger) and do something that made me feel like my own person and not just a worse version of Rachel. I became interested in cooking and started to experiment more. November comes and I finally find something that I really like, cocktails.\n\nI got excited since it was almost my birthday and I would finally be allowed to buy alcohol at the liquor store (drinking age here is 18 but you can’t buy anything above 3,5% until 20). I am looking up ingredients, shakers, types of alcohol etc. and deciding how to collect my own bar. I spoke about this new interest / hobby / passion with my dad and he seemed happy that I found something that really sparked joy for me.\n\nSo I finally found a shaker that I liked this week but I have to wait until end of this month or next month to make sure that I can afford to order it, I inform my dad that I found ‘the one’ and show him the picture.

From the start of our relationship, we agreed that either of us can have sex with someone else as long as we’re informed about it beforehand. We both agree that there is a distinct difference between a romantic relationship and a sexual one, and so long as we together are the only ones in a romantic relationship, we don’t care what the opposite person does with their body.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago where my boyfriend tells me “I think I cheated on you”, and when I asked why he thought that, he said “You know Jake? Yeah, so he and I had sex last week” (not his real name, obviously).\n\nI honestly thought how he worded that was really funny, and I told him I wasn’t mad as long as he told me beforehand next time. He agreed, and we’re completely fine.\n\nToday, I went to my coworker ‘Nikki’ to tell her about the funny encounter (we tell each other a lot of things like this, so it’s not exactly weird). She was confused until I reminded her that we’re in an open relationship, and then agreed that it was pretty amusing.\n\nMy assistant manager, who we’ll call ‘Anna’, was not so amused after overhearing this conversation. She told me to break up with my boyfriend, and when I said that it was okay and explained the open relationship, she told me that he was an asshole for cheating and that I was an asshole for thinking that it was funny.\n\nObviously, I know I’m not an asshole for finding the encounter humorous, but I’m starting to feel like an asshole for bringing it up in the first place. I feel so bad for making anyone think that my boyfriend was a bad person.\n\n\nTl;dr Am I the asshole for painting my boyfriend out as a cheater to my coworker, and should I have kept it to myself?",

            "input": "So this is not my usual account, as I don't want people to know that my marriage is on the rocks.  I'd like to start by giving you a rundown of our history so far, so you can get a general idea of what each of us are dealing with. This will be long. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nMy husband and I have been married just over 5 years. What I didn't know when we got married was that my husband had a gambling issue. He hid it very well when we were dating and for a good few months after we got married, but then as we started living together there were aspects that didn't add up. Less than a year into the marriage he admitted that he had a gambling issue.\n\nMy husband is paid weekly, and his pay is fairly high compared to my own. He earns about 75k per year, whereas I earn about 60k now. To compound on the pay gap, I was a student when we first met (husband is a lot older), and worked restaurant jobs during the first two years of marriage. Then I moved onto an admin job, and now I am working in my field of choice. It is entirely fair to say that my husband has consistently earned more than me. I estimate that if I had brought in about 110k over the last 5 years, my husband had earned around 200k or a little more.\n\nMy issue is that my husband had never, not once, missed a week of gambling. Each payday he is in a pub or at the casino, gambling. The smallest amount from memory is about $200.00 per week. When he is feeling especially addicted, he will literally blow his entire week's wage on pokie machines, and then ask me for part of my wages too. This has happened more times than I can count. \n\nDuring our marriage, I have managed to compile approximately $30k in personal loan debts and $42k for a car loan. He has asked money from every member of his family, to the point they will no longer lend him money. He gambles every tax return away. He has gambled about $8k of personal loan debts. We have since sold the car, so I have about 30k in debts owing in my name.\n\nI interpret this to mean that my husband is not bringing in enough money into the relationship, regardless of how much he is earning, as he is spending a significant chunk on gambling. \n\nMeanwhile, I generally try to scrimp. I cut my hair once a year, I never do my nails, I don't buy clothes unless I absolutely need it. I feel that even if I have earned less, I have brought into the relationship as much, or arguably even more, than my husband. \n\nMy husband does not agree. He is adamant that he could not have spent as much as I say he has. We fight over money every payday. I was patient and kind the first year or so, until my personality started getting ugly, and frankly abusive, towards my husband. In my defense, I genuinely have never shouted at another person in my life. My husband is the only person I lose my temper with. We are now at the point where I will be screaming all sorts of abuses at him at the top of my lungs. I feel like if I don't, I will die or implode from stress.\n\nI am now at a point where I inform him on almost a weekly basis that I will be leaving him. He is now immune to my threats, understandably, but it's like an addiction I cannot stop. My husband now informs me that I am not 'loyal' for saying such things. That we should be sticking it out through thick and thin, and he is hurt that I would say such things.\n\nLast week we agreed that each of us would bring in an equal amount into the relationship, and the rest of our money we would spend as we please, whether we are gambling or doing our hair. He was good last week. However, this week, he claims not to have received his wage, that their system had been down, and he would give me the money when he received it. He was supposed to have been paid on Wednesday. It is now Thursday night, and he says he will receive it tomorrow. He asked to lend me $50, he just wanted a drink at the pub, he will pay me back tomorrow along with our fixed amount. I agreed. An hour later he called me and asked me to lend him another 100. He will pay me back tomorrow, he says. Through 5 years of his working at this company, his pay has been delayed once. I therefore informed him that I find this hard to believe, and if he showed me his bank account and confirmed that he had not received his wage, I will give him the 100. He flat out refuses and asks me why I cannot wait until tomorrow, if I just wait, I will know. I once again blew my top and screamed at him. \n\nI now know that because I screamed at him, he will be upset, and feel justified in spending everything he has and blame me because I could not wait one day.\n\nAITA for 1. asking my husband to show me his bank account in the first place and 2. losing my temper when he didn't?\n\n(I think people will want to know this - why do I keep giving him money? He will not stop asking until I give it to him. If I lock myself in a room at midnight so I can sleep for work the next day, he will bang on the door until I open it and give him money. He has hacked into my bank account a few times to take my money without my consent.)\n\nTL;DR: husband has been gambling significant amounts of money since early on in our 5 year marriage. I became suspicious that he was lying to me today and asked him to show me his bank account as proof, and screamed at him when he wouldn't.",

I know I need help, and I'm looking for it incessantly.\n\nNow, my boyfriend. He is one gem of a person. Has stood with me through ALL OF IT. Every single panic attack, suicide attempt, everything. He keeps reassuring me that I make him happy, and he is not affected by all of this. But I can't believe him. I feel like a burden, a liability, a very unstable person who is making this relationship toxic. I feel like I'm burdening a beautiful, positive, near-perfect guy with undue stress. Yes, a good relationship should see through good and bad times, but I feel like I've become incapable of doing normal, human things, and I don't want to be around him and infect his surroundings with my mental issues.\n\nSo, I ask him to leave me. Every now and then. I'm okay, well-balanced and peaceful for a few days, but again I find some reason to shout at him, and ask him to leave. I still feel like that's what we should do. Every time this happens, he sees through it, and sticks with me, solid. He says we can face anything together, and that I am not a burden. \n\nI used to think I'm doing this for his own good, but now I just feel shitty for playing with his feelings and going back and forth, though he says I'm not. So, am I the asshole here?\n\nP.S.: I am definitely not looking for validation. Please don't say that.

As long as this doesn't end up creeping into hours, or goes on later than 7PM. That should also help with keeping quiet while the younger one has a nap or to pleasantly take off some burden while we're doing house chores. There's a lot to be learned for some series in there, like 'The Magic School Bus'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, since my wife is so anti-TV / cartoons, this is affecting my relationship with my 5yo, as we both want to play Mario or other kids video games together.

The problem was that, even tho I \"love\" her, I haven't been \"in love\" with her for a while now, so I wouldn never initiate sex or cuddles, and being affectionate towards her looked very forced and fake on my part.\nBecause of this dilemma, I feel like I might have done more bad than good as she is not stupid, and even though she hasn't mentioned anything, she probably knows something is up, which means I might have just made her sadder for the past year instead of helping her at all. \n\nNow, a little over a month a go, this relative passed away so I've spent nearly every day with her, and it seems like there will never be a good time to tell her I've lost feelings for her, and that I want to end the relationship. \n\n\nAITA for staying with her?

Spent my christmas money and money I got for doing good in school somewhere near the end of the year and I recieved very little pocket money. I had about 40 euros before that. On January 30th, 2016 I bought a lego dimensions expansion box, 30 euros. This is a videogame with actual lego and I wanted it for some time. I had only 11 euros by valentine’s day. About a week before then she asked whether we should do something on valentine’s day. It would have been on a sunday. I said that we could just hang out, but she insisted we’d do something. It was the last week for star wars: the force awakens. We both had seen it and I said I’d rather spend the day at her home or at mine, but she really wanted to go. The price for movie tickets were 11.50 a piece and thats excluding popcorn etc. I said I didn’t have too much money so asked whether we could split the price 50/50, as I would recieve my pocket money before that. No no no, I should pay for it, she said, because that’s romantic. Well, I don’t have my money, but I’m sure my parents could buy it! That’s not romantic either. Fine, I’ll pay she said. In addition, we also could buy a rose at school, but we said to each other that we wouldn’t do it and I was planning to get one before we went to the movie theatre. That friday she texted me that she was very mad at me for not getting more money and spending it two weeks earlier, when we didn’t have any plans for it yet. I responded saying this, she ignored that. Later that day, I got a rose. The last class of the day I sat in front of two girls who I regularly have a chit-chat with and explained the situation, which might’ve made my girlfriend mad because she probably overheard me. The next day I was playing a sportsgame at 8 in the morning so I left and didn’t check my phone. We got home and we left to go to an amusement park and were away the entire day. I had left my phone at home. We ate on our way home and got home at 9. Me being younger meant that I fell asleep immediately, again not checking my phone. The next day I had a lot of texts from the school group chat for homework so my girlfriend’s text was at the bottom. I didn’t read it and found out about it in the evening. We chatted for a while and she ended it with a ‘see you tomorrow’. We met up and she broke up with me. I know this is long, but thanks for reading anyway. ",

But I'm really proud of how much I've accomplished so far, so I've admittedly posted a few things on social media.\n\nOne of the few things I posted was a before/after picture to celebrate me not being obese anymore. In the caption I said something about how glad I am that I started this journey, and a few things about how miserable I was in the before picture because I was always in pain and felt so unattractive, and how much better this has been for my health and my confidence. I only talked about my feelings towards my body, and I was very careful not to bring other people into it or make generalizations about other obese people because I know from firsthand experience how hurtful that is.\n\nSo I got some compliments and the usual \"you go, girl!\" from some of my friends, but then when I met up with my friend Jen she started talking about the post. Jen's had body image issues for a long time and always puts herself down. She's talked a lot before about wishing she was thin. Her problems got worse for a while a few months ago because her now ex-bf of two years cheated on her with a skinny girl and she took as a sign that she's not good enough. I'm including this because it's the part that makes me wonder the most if I'm an insensitive asshole for not thinking of how the post would make her feel.\n\nJen said the post made her feel worse about herself and asked if I could tone it down. She said it seems kind of arrogant of me to brag about how easy it has been for me to lose weight, and that my behavior on social media looks like I just want attention. She said me talking about how I didn't like my body before would make other people feel bad, and that I should try to be more compassionate. She told me to be careful that I don't turn into the same kind of person I used to hate. I didn't really know what to say so I thanked her and told her she'd given me a lot to think about and I would try to have more empathy moving forward. Kind of regretting it now?\n\nJen's the sweetest person ever, and it's killing me to know that my post hurt her. It's true that I like the feeling of people cheering me on and complimenting me on my weight loss, after a lifetime of being the fat girl who was always insulted and never taken seriously. But I've made four posts about my weight loss in seven months. That doesn't seem like a lot. I still want to keep posting my accomplishments. Part of me is saying that it's my accomplishment and if I want to brag about it on social media, a place where everyone brags about everything, it's not my fault if someone takes it too personally. But at the same time I feel guilty, especially given Jen's history. AITA?",

I really love spending time with him and his girlfriend. He said the party would probably start at around 10, so I figured I could go to another party beforehand. On the way to the first party my car breaks down and my friends and I end up there at around 9:30 so we decide to stay a little later. \n\nAt 11:15 we realize that if we left right then we would get to my friend’s 21st birthday party at around 12:15 because it’s about 45 minutes away from the second party and people asked me to drop them home on the way. I told a few friends we were leaving and they were all trying to convince me to stay. ImWe weren’t sure we should leave because we didn’t really want to spend New Years in a car. I text my friend and ask if it’s ok if we come to his house after midnight. I was worried about this because NYE is his actual birthday and if we went later than 12 we would be missing his birthday. But he said it was ok and not to worry.  \n\nAt 12:03 he texted and said that him and his girlfriend were getting tired and that they were going to go to bed, so we shouldn’t come over. I apologized and he said it was ok and that it was not a big deal. Leading up to the party he stressed multiple times that it was a low key event and that we could come when we want etc.\n\nHowever now he isn’t replying to my texts and all of my friends that did go to his party aren’t replying to my texts either. I realize that in hindsight I could have corralled my drunk friends earlier and we could have gotten there in time. I feel terrible. On one hand his party did only start at 10 and was two hours and I figured it would go later. On the other, it was his twenty first and he is one of my best friends and I only get to see him every few months. Am I the Asshole? I would be pissed at me if I was him. He is going back to college this weekend and so I feel like I wasted my chances to see him. \n\nTL;DR one of my closest friends had a NYE 21st birthday party that started at 10 and my friends couldn’t get there until past midnight. When midnight came he told me the party was over. Now he’s not replying to any messages. AITA? ",

            "input": "I wrote this out once, but it ended up being super long so I tried to cut it down a bit. It didn't work too well. I (23m) am pissed at my girlfriend (24f) for going out and adopting a cat today, without even talking to me about it. We've been together for a little over a year, and have known each other for about a year and a half. She has a two year old daughter from a previous relationship, and they split custody almost 50/50. I had no intentions of having kids at this point in my life, but here I am trying to do my best. \n\nAnyway, my girlfriend recently moved out of her sister's house after her sister's dog bit her daughter. She moved into a small apartment on her own. I haven't moved in because my commute to work would be about an hour, and she's not even sure she's going to stay there when her lease is up near the end of this year. Also I'm just not sure I'm ready for that. She took two pay cuts last year, one because her job was making her miserable so she found something else. The other because the new place fired her and a bunch of other people after they got a remote staff. I gave her support and encouragement both times. Now she makes less than ever, and is trying to make it on her own. Her new job was super understanding of the move and everybody donated stuff to help her get on her feet, and they pooled together about $2000 to help her so she wouldn't have to get a second job. My problem is that she has no concept of financial responsibility. She's constantly spending money on useless things, without concern for how it will affect her bank account in the morning. For example, a $30 oil diffuser that she used for a week and then gave away because it wasn't helping her sleep like the internet said it would. She got one $30 lamp (that didn't even come with a shade), instead of the 3 $10 lamps that I suggested, but now complains that it's too dark. She has two gym memberships that she never uses, she just bought the new iPhone, even though her old one worked just fine, etc. We always go back and forth over what she should, and shouldn't buy, and she's already gone in the negatives, and needed someone to bail her out. I constantly try to help her with advice, and she always nods and then does the exact opposite, and it comes around to bite her in the butt. Or she'll call up her dad right in front of me, and ask him, and he'll say the same thing I did. I come from a family that is terrible with their money, and I've been helping to pay bills, (groceries, rent, medical bills, new appliances, renovations, taxes one year, brother's attorney most recently) since I was 10, while my stepdad was out buying a motorcycle, new guns, etc. So I know what it's like to be in a family with spending problems, eventually someone has to pay. But this means I also know how to handle my finances, and am usually never strapped for cash. Whereas, she's always had her dad (who generally agrees with me about her spending habits) to bail her out when things get hairy.\n\nSo this brings us to this cat. She said she gets bored and lonely on the rare weekend where she doesn't have her daughter, and I have things to get done at my house so I don't come to her. So she adopted an 8 year old cat. She got the cat for the two days every other month that she's alone, but it's going to be another responsibility every day for her. She complains that when she has her daughter she never has time to get things done, so instead of getting back into the gym those day, or getting a hobby, she got a living creature that she will now be responsible for. It has all of its shots, and its check ups are all up to date, I get it, she doesn't have to put much money into the cat right now, but eventually she will. Between cat food, litter, vet bills, damage to the furniture or apartment, eventually it will be a burden. She has a 2 year old who is already so much responsibility, I don't know why she thought a pet would make things better. The other problem is she knows that I'm allergic to cats. She knows they make my eyes, neck, and back of my throat itchy, they make my eyes water, and nose run. It's unpleasant for me to be around cats like that. They're cute to look at on the internet, but that's just where I prefer them to stay. She knows this. Yes, I can take allergy medicine but it's not 100% effective, plus that's more money that I have to spend, just to be mostly comfortable when I'm with her. I can honestly get past the allergy part, I'm bothered that I didn't factor in at all into her decision, sure, but the money thing is really what's concerning to me. Sure the cat could end up being perfect with no extra vet bills, but that would only encourage her to get more unnecessary things. Also this isn't the first animal she's adopted. She got a dog not long before she got pregnant while she was living with her ex in an apartment. Then she had to give it to her dad when she couldn't handle it while being pregnant. \n\nSo basically I'm hurt that she didn't even ask me about it. She said no matter what I said it wouldn't have stopped her. She's surprised I'm making such a big deal out of this, and that I'll just get over it. I didn't ask her to, but she said she won't apologize for doing it or even for not getting my opinion, and is acting like I'm a terrible person. Any major thing I do, I try to hear out her opinion on, because this is supposed to be a team effort, but she purposely didn't say anything to me because she knows I would have told her I didn't think it would be a good idea. Since I don't live there I don't get a say, even though she wants me to move in, but with her getting a cat I'm even less likely to do it. I get that we don't split bills and that she can spend her money however she wants, but I'm concerned that she won't change in the future when the bills are split, and I'll be in a family that struggles just like I've been in for the past 23 years. Or that she won't have the money when her daughter actually needs something, and I don't mean another giant toy that there's no room for. She has so many medical bills from herself and her daughter, and I know there will be more, no two year old in daycare stays healthy for long. I told her I wasn't okay with it, and that I'm very frustrated with this decision. I didn't give her an ultimatum or anything, and honestly I don't know what I even want to happen moving forward. I'm just at my wits end, and I wish she saved for unexpected expenses, and would listen to me for once. I've never taken more than about five minutes to move on after her poor decisions, but this time it's been all day, and I still haven't moved on. Am I the asshole for being so frustrated by this, or is she right and I should just get over it?",

At the same time we planned for my parents to come for one of the weeks and are visiting from my home country. We planned to stay together and do activities in that time. My Mom generously said my Dad and her would cover things while we were together. Awesome. I'm super thankful for them doing this. So one of the days we finish a small fishing trip and some wine tasting and my partner and I had discussed maybe doing dinner just the two of us. I ask/let my Mom know that we wanted to have a dinner out, just the two of us and they are all sweet with it and say they're planning on eating in. Side note, my Dad still cooks like 6 people still live in a house so already on our holiday we have too much food. So we eventually find a place, order, eat and have some leftovers of a half n' half pizza. We end up going back to the AirBnb and I go to chill in the our room. My Mom comes in chewing on a piece of my partner's pizza and sits down on the bed staring at me. I kinda gave her this look to which she says something along the lines of \"What..why are you looking at me like that/what's the matter??\" I think I said something like \"Well, that's Dan's pizza... you should have asked.\" Immediately she gets angry/hurt/defensive, says something (can't remember), I respond then she leaves. Suddenly outside the room on the balcony I hear her talking quite upset to my partner about what I said.   \n\n\nDan didn't know at all what was going on. He had come out of the toilet and was having a smoke when she came up. (D for Dan, M for Mom)\n\nM: \"Sorry Dan I ate a piece of pizza, I hope thats fine\"\n\nD: \"Absolutely, not a problem, but I would liked to be asked in the future.\"\n\nM: \"Why?\"\n\nD: \"Its just common courtesy.\"\n\nM: \"But we've paid for everything. We've paid for the trip, accomodation, activities. I don't have to ask for a bit of pizza.\"\n\nD: \"Its still common courtesy to ask regardless of what has been done.\"\n\nM: \"Well I've given you all this and I expect the same in return.\"\n\nAt this point we were just trying to get across that common courtesy should be used no matter the case. We paid for the pizza and still may have wanted it, but were happy to share. We tried giving other examples but it boiled down to her believing/expectation that if she gives then she expects to receive no questions in return. We tried to explain that she made it seem like listing what they've paid for was more a gift with strings attached rather than an unconditional gift. We also said that while those might be her expectations, other people (like us) don't necessarily expect the same of others.\n\nIt ended with silence, in the morning it was the same and is still technically unresolved but I was left feeling like I wasn't wrong but guilty because she/my Dad had paid for everything. Reddit, am AITA somewhere in this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Mom and Dad paid for part of a two week trip we (including my partner) spent together.

He had an aversion to commitment, so we never put a label on things. He was constantly drunk, unmotivated, and by month 6, we were both extremely unhappy. He was unemployed out of college, and would not apply for any jobs he saw as below him, like waiting tables. It came out that his dad cheated on his mom. There was a lot going on for him and he seemed to cling to the relationship for stability. \n\nIt’s important to note here that Dave and I were friends for 2 years before we dated, and he helped me through quite a bit. So every time I expressed how deeply unhappy I was, he’d beg for two more weeks, insistent that whatever job he’d just applied for would definitely come through and things would get better when he was working, and every time I backed off and agreed to two more weeks. That went on for months before I finally called it off. I developed an attraction to our mutual friend, but out of respect for my quasi-relationship, completely cut contact with said guy as soon as I noticed the attraction. This is important for later.\n\nCome to find out, he lied to me about graduating school. He actually failed out, and that’s why no jobs were working out. I’m still pretty angry about this. He had to have known every time he begged for two more weeks that, if he was refusing to apply to jobs that were “below” him, that he wasn’t going to get a job at all. It was an awful relationship. \n\nSo, remember that friend? Let’s call him Bruce. Bruce and I reconnected after I broke up with Dave. IMPORTANT: 1) I did not meet Bruce THROUGH Dave. I met them independently at the same time about 3 years ago. 2) Bruce and Dave are not particularly close, they were in the same fraternity of 70-some guys, but ran in mostly different circles, with very little overlap. 3) Nothing ever happened between Bruce and I while I was dating Dave, I just noticed I had a crush and stopped talking to or hanging out with Bruce. \n\nBruce and I started dating 3 months after my breakup with Dave. I am incredibly happy, it’s a much better fit and a much healthier relationship.

A girl I work with took it to my bosses and I am waiting to be told about it. \n\nI have to be quick because I have to get ready for work. \n\nBasically I work in a place where the long time staffers bully the new people. I don't know any other way to put it. New people are oftentimes ignored if they need help. We are barked at for not doing things while we're in the middle of doing those things. More than once I have cried on my way home from work because of how cruel these other girls could be.\n\nI thought maybe it was me so I changed my attitude from dreading going there and taking everything really hard to a positive attitude. That worked for a few days. Then, the Friday before last, I got yelled at for literally everything. \"You need to go to the dining room!\" When I was going there. They didn't need to say that. \n\nI made a very dumb mistake and I owned it but one of my co-workers threw paperwork at me and yelled at me that she wasn't doing her job because I screwed up my job and that i would have to do both. A nurse was nearby, heard this 40 something woman yelling at me, and did nothing. \n\nAfter a long day of one thing after another I got told that I \"never listen\" because I wasn't paying attention to a woman who I didn't realize was talking to me while I tried to do some paperwork on a resident. She was trying to give me more work to do when I was supposed to be going home shortly. I told her that it sounded like another shift should do that, as I was going home very soon, and she said \"well then it'll never get done!\" Which I guess is a compliment but by then my feelings were in the gutter and I burst into tears. \n\nI clocked out early against the rules and went and cried in my car because I had really tried that day not to let the bullying get to me but it didn't matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stop and eventually I broke. \n\nSo when i got home I posted this thing talking about my experience there. All of the new people who started with me also have similar experiences.  I deleted the post very quickly but a girl still took it to one of my bosses and I only found out about it last night. It really explains why different people in different departments really ramped up the bullying in the past week. The post must have been passed around. \n\nAITA for posting that on Facebook after my bad day ?",

I lived with one of these roommates last year and we got along well, but the other four are completely new.\n\nLast year, I lived in this house and we had a command hook in the bathroom that I would use to hang up my towel when I showered. While I was out of the country last summer, one my roommates (J) basically redecorated and refurbished the place. When I got back, the command hook was still there, so I hung my towel up there for the shower. Throughout the entirety of the fall semester, no one complained about this whatsoever. I assumed it was the same command hook that was there from last year, but in reality, J bought a new one and hung it up.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, I came home drunk from a bar and for some reason, J decided that 1:00am on a Saturday would be the best time to tell me that I could no longer use this command hook because he bought it and would like to use it to hang up his clothes while he showered. Drunk aitathrowaway1321 slurred \"yeah okay, whatever\" and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning, having absolutely zero memory of this conversation, I showered and then went to the gym to sweat out the hangover. After coming back, I jumped in the shower and noticed that my towel was missing! There was a little blue sticky note next to the hook that said \"missing something? Follow the sticky notes!\" I followed the sticky notes downstairs naked (because no towel) and was greeted with my towel hanging downstairs next to a sticky note that said \"bet you must've missed me after you came back from the gym! Next time, buy your own fucking command hook!\"\n\nI hung the towel on the bannister outside the bathroom to avoid a fight, but I chewed my roommate out for being passive aggressive and not talking to me beforehand. We still sometimes have arguments over this when I forgetfully hang the towel on this command hook, which he really only uses to hang his clothes on while he showers. I feel like his passive aggressive response and him getting angry at me is way overblown for this kind of situation; furthermore, it's kind of unreasonable for him to expect me to change my routine which bothered no one for five whole months! Furthermore, command hooks are literally like $2, so I feel like the response is disproportionate to the overall crime. This situation has also caused my other housemates to gang up on me too, so needless to say, I'm not too happy about it.\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking that my roommate is being unreasonable? I'm trying to avoid a fight, but it's kinda hard to when all of my roommates are now ganging up on me about this. ",

My brother on the other hand sold my dad's stuff, gave him money for what my dad paid for it and pocketed the rest. This came to like $15,000. Then he split town a couple weeks later and told me, \"this mess is not my problem and that I owe you nothing.\" My dad's frame of reference is so fucked he thought he made out on this deal.

How could they pull this shit on me after all we went through together?\n\nI just always thought that family was supposed to stick together no matter what and I feel so devastated and abandoned that my brothers would betray me and my sisters like that.

He also decided the funeral would be too much for him. I was heartbroken and this was a huge event in my life that I wish he could've accompanied me with. I tried to put myself in his shoes and realized that he would not want to go through such a thing but it still hurt because I wish he was with me at my side and wanted his support.\n\nFast forward months later, a few weeks ago he was telling me that he wanted to travel alone to another country, to better his mental health and to discover new things about himself. I was completely on board with it and encouraged him to do so. \n\nHe then informs me yesterday that instead of traveling alone, he was going to go to Japan with his friend. His friend loves Japanese culture and is planning to go to Japan in May, and my boyfriend said he would tag along. He then asked if I would be mad at him for doing so. While I wasn't mad, I was incredibly hurt that this was so spontaneous and that I felt like he didn't consider that I would've wanted to go with him. \n\nHe then said that he was surprised I wasn't on board with him going to Japan right away and that he wished I could come with him, but he was sorry I couldn't. And that made me feel even more sad. I said it's completely fine if he goes to Japan, as he can make his own decisions, but I was still a little hurt that I felt like he didn't consider I've always wanted to go with him. And that I felt he didn't want to go with me. And then we got into an argument about this whole mess.\n\n\nAITA for being hurt that my bf would rather go to Japan with his friend instead?",

I warned said friend about not buying games on my steam so that I would not have to worry about paying him back. He goes on to buy two games that add up to nearly $80. I bought him the key for one game and I still need to reimburse for the game that went on sale.   \n\n\n  \nLong version- Sorry if my  TL:DR didn't make a lot of sense. I am not really good with them.  \n\n\nI have a friend that wanted to play more PC games and try out certain games that I had in my steam library. Trying to be nice, I allowed him onto my steam so that he can play those games that he was interested in. I warned my friend that if he wanted to buy games then he would need to make his own account, so I wouldn't have to worry about reimbursing him for anything. Lo and behold he bought two games; one worth $20, and another worth $60. Of course, I was pretty livid, but I said I'll try to reimburse him for the games to the best of my abilities. My friend has not touched it since then, but recently asked me to reimburse him for the $60 game since I just paid him back for the $20 game. I literally had a mental breakdown because I barely have the money right now to pay back for those games since rent/utilities/etc has been kicking my ass. I confided in my boyfriend and he told me I don't need to pay him back in full; I just need to pay him back with a key.   \n\n\nI felt super guilty about it since I feel like I'm scamming him, but my boyfriend had reminded me that I had warned him about buying games on my account, and that it's not fair to me for reimbursing games that I'm not going to touch unless I'm actually interested.   \n\n\nI had asked for the receipt for the game, but he had sent me a screenshot of the first time he had bought the code. I asked where he had bought the CD code and he said amazon, and then someone else bought him another CD code for the same exact game through amazon again. And right now, there's a sale on it for $35.99 on steam. So I told him I could have just gifted me a new key for cheaper, but now he's giving me excuses about how someone else had bought the code for him and amazon doesn't do refunds as well as not providing me with the more recent receipt. I haven't replied since then as I'm still really upset about it.   \n\n\nSo AITA if I want to reimburse my friend with a new key code for a game he's interested in, instead of paying him back in full?  \n\n\n  \n\n\nP.S.-I'm sorry if my story is all over the place.

So, you don't really know a lot about your needs before you pick. I picked a highly-rated pediatrician (recommended by my OB). I gave birth to an infant with minor issues, so we go to the doctor a lot. \n\nAround the time I gave birth, the pediatrician sold his practice and there were a lot of changes. Email, online appointments and an after-hours advice nurse phone line were discontinued and we were told they would come back once the system switched, but it hasn't in over a year. As a result of everything needing to be conducted by phone, there are long holds every time I call their office...a simple appointment change for a vaccine can take me 30 minutes on the phone. The doctors do not offer call-backs with advice or answers to simple questions -- everything requires an appointment, which is expensive ($150-$270). The front office is also disorganized and once lost our vaccination records. They frequently leave me voicemails reminding me of \"Emily's\" appointment (Not my daughter's name at all!) and call her \"Emily\" in the office (the doctor doesn't do this, just his staff). Recently, there was a change in nurses. The new nurse didn't have a lot of experience. She gave my baby the first of 3 vaccines and got freaked out by the crying and told me, \"I can't do this. I can't do this.\" I told her okay, then we have to get another nurse to do the rest. She said no, she will get fired and then tried to give my baby the 2nd shot and I refused to let her. I made a small scene and insisted the more senior nurse administer the rest of the vaccines. The office staff acted like I'm the Asshole. I complained directly to the doctor and he understood but said he no longer manages his nurses since he sold his practice. He said he would tell my complaint to her manager. AITA on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was frustrated and tried another ped. who had a lab, advice nurse, email, etc. I met with her and did not like her at all. I felt she was dismissive and her style was more rigid than my laid-back former pediatrician. She was also 45 minutes late to our appointment and when I asked the office staff why it was taking so long (sitting in a room full of people with the flu with an infant) they said she was on a personal phone call!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I decided to go back to my former ped.  However, when I called to make my appointment the receptionist, opening her chart (which every office can see everywhere) saw we went somewhere else and told me I am high-maintenance and I \"keep jumping around.\" She said that she will have to ask the pediatrician if he wants to \"take me back.\" I don't see how she can say I keep jumping around when I have only been to 2 pediatricians. Maybe she is referring to when my doctor was on vacation and he scheduled us with his partner. AITA? Is it really not okay to try out new pediatricians?",

I want to get back together with her and\n\nMy ex and I dated for about 4 years prior to us breaking up about 9 months ago.  I initiated the break up due to emotional issues stemming from my father's death in August 2017 (I was having a lot of difficulty processing and expressing emotions healthily and she is already a very emotional person and I kept asking myself \"How am I supposed to take care of your emotional needs when i can't even take care of my own?\"  I've since learned that letting people in is not weakness, as well as made progress towards getting past being constantly affected by the loss of the greatest man I've ever known).  At the time, she had said she would like to remain friends and we actually made earnest and sincere efforts to be friends; hanging out at neutral and public locations, paying for ourselves if food/drink/entertainment became involved, etc.  A few weeks ago, it came to a point where we realized the feelings were still there, mutually, but that we would need to talk more about how it was going to work between us (it used to be very one-sided in my direction and I want to put the balance more towards the middle) if we were to get back together.  So we began talking about getting back together and we still are.\n\nDuring all this time, she started hanging out another guy.  I was fine with this because we were broken up at the time and he seemed like a good friend to her.  Until a lot of things happened to make me feel the opposite.  Without going too deep into it and making this a stupidly long post, he has an abusive streak that he's using to control her.  In recent months, he's had her cosign for a brand new motorcycle and rejected getting a used car, isolated her from most of her friends, and move in with him into an apartment that she can barely afford half the rent on (and he can't pass a tenant screening so she's on the hook for that, too).  If she were to take on the amount of time necessary for her to afford more plus bills, she would have to quit school.  Everytime I come to her place, I'm told by her to just not engage (I do not like this \"man\" and refuse to do him the courtesy of hiding it from my face).  When I leave, he gets in her face and tries to intimidate her accusing her of bringing me over to have sex (the woman was on the floor shaking in obvious medical distress and he said, \"You're a needy little cunt, aren't you?\" and left.  I was there to help take care of her.).\n\nI have told her that she needs to get out of there, I have pointed out all the red flags, and she has been told how all of those were also things done to her by her mother (very abusive childhood).  I have also said that I can't control what she does with her life or who she hangs out with when we date again, but I have told her that if we moved in together, he will not be welcome in my home and I refuse to make him feel welcome in my home (still debating whether I'm even going to *let* him feel welcome in my home.  I am aware that it would be her home, too.).  She is still intent on being friends with him.  I haven't dropped the \"It's either him or me,\" line and I'm afraid of it coming to that because I'm not sure I would win but more importantly, it would put a huge strain on our relationship and I'm not sure we would outlast it before she realized that getting away from him was a good thing.

I've met some of my best friends there, including my best friend who I've known for almost 4 years now, and although we do have some drama, it's worth it because I really truly love these people.\n\n​\n\nThe most recent drama happened when I found out the aforementioned friend had made a private group chat with some of my other close friends. Of course I was hurt - why wouldn't they want me there? The real problem though, was that I had to kind of push him to tell me, because I suspected it and if I didn't know for sure, my mind would have gone to a very dark place and assumed the worst. See, I have anxiety, which means that I have a tendency to get very paranoid and assume the worst of a situation is true, especially in situations like this, where I think there might be people doing things without me, especially very close friends like this. But, to make things worse, I later found out that he hadn't told me the full truth about this group chat. I won't say specifically, but the important part is that he left out some crucial details about what they were doing in the chat. I found this out from a different friend who was also in the group.\n\n​\n\nThis really hurt me. I thought I could trust my friend. I would have trusted him with anything. I understand why he held back, cause he knew it would hurt me, but being lied to hurts so much worse. I hate being left in the dark. When there's important information about me that I don't know, I tend to panic and overreact, because of my anxiety, and the only real thing that helps is getting some solid, concrete facts. So now that I know he doesn't want to tell me the whole truth in certain situations, I find it harder to trust him.\n\n​\n\nSo here's the real conflict: I now trust him less, and I know he's inclined to do things behind my back, without me. However, he feels like me asking about these things is an invasion of his privacy. Of course I believe he has a right to privacy, and I also know he has a right to do whatever with whoever he wants, however much it may hurt me. I feel conflicted though. As I mentioned, when I'm in the dark I panic, so I go to him and ask him if he's doing things without me, which he feels is an invasion of his privacy. But I don't know what else to do. Not knowing is so much more painful. I don't know how to respect his privacy but also be aware of what's going on. \n\n​\n\nI've never felt so conflicted. I feel like a real asshole for invading his privacy and for not feeling like I can trust him as much now. I feel like maybe I'm a bad friend for not trying to understand his side enough or something... I'm having trouble making sense out of this situation entirely.",

My naive dumb ass asked if it was mine and of course it turns out she's pregnant by one of the biggest losers in school, her ex-boyfriend whom she dumped after realizing what a piece of shit he was.  \n\n(Side note, this dude has 4 kids;  my step-daughter, her half-brother (adopted by a new awesome father), a child with down syndrome whom he had with this 40+yo wife who died in a car accident, and another girl who got pregnant and ran to Washington state to get away from him.)\n\nI digress.  The entire pregnancy was a nightmare.  The father would stir up drama every chance he got and caused nothing but problems.  Tried to fight me at the NICU she was in for 3 months as she was born 2 months early, started rumors at school, confronted me, etc.  My father-in-law sat us both down and gave us this talk:  \"Life is about pussy. . .\" basically made us shake hands and agree to be gentleman.  That didn't last long as he started stalking us.  Also, while it was his weekend with the baby, we would see him at the mall by himself or with friends and no baby.  When asked, of course his parents were watching her.  Fast forward many years of compulsive lying and general neglect, HE CALLS CPS...ON US.  Told his doctor we were putting cigarettes out on her which was in no shape or form true in any way.  She's a \"picker\" and had picked some bug bites or whatever and of course when you pick your wounds they look worse.  She still does it today.  We decided after all the drama and all the pain he's caused our beloved daughter that he didn't deserve to see her anymore.  The child support payments stopped immediately.  It's now been 7 years without a single payment, but this isn't about him. \n\nMy wife is a type 1 diabetic with multiple complications as a result of her not taking care of herself.  We have struggled to get her on any kind of insurance or coverage that would help her with her diabetes.  While I was in the Army, she had Tricare which was awesome and even left us with 6 months of supplies after the fact which was a life saver.  Her complications go from being like 90% blind (maybe worse, eye appointment upcoming) - can't read the big E on the eye chart to missing toes to nerve damage to diabetic gastroparesis.  We are days apart (age 31) and she's suffering badly.  Now, all that being said, she doesn't check her blood sugar regularly, doesn't take insulin properly, prefers to have a blood sugar &gt;200 as opposed to 100-200 where it's supposed to be because being \"low\" feels so much worse than a blood sugar high.  Food?  Psh.  Anything fried or covered in sugar is her favorite.  Donuts, french fries, burgers, anything sweet that isn't chocolate.  I KNOW I don't help.  My diet sucks, I eat fast food constantly and I'm a little overweight and I love the sweets too.  Here's the difference:  I know I eat like shit and I want to change it.  I've made several attempts to change my diet and excersize more only to fail over and over again.  I've managed to stick to a \"low-carb, high vegetable, low-fat\" diet for a few weeks at a time, during which she is AWFUL.  Complains constantly, never stops talking about ice cream or gummy bears.  When we were short on time one evening, I said \"Hey, I'm going to burger king to get a salad...do you want one?\" - trying to at least nudge her in the general right direction.  'No, get me the triple double bacon with cheese and extra fries with a giant diet coke'.  I've tried this HUNDREDS of times to convince her to eat right.  Here's the thing, she's beautiful, gorgeous and FAR from fat.  I'm not trying to get her to eat right so she'll lose weight, I'm trying to get her to eat right to save her fucking life.  We've accumulated probably over $1,000,000 in hospital bills due to 9-10 emergency room visits a year.  When she gets sick, they usually keep her in the hospital at least a week and the recovery at home can be 2-4 weeks at which point the cycle starts over again where she's getting sick in that timeframe and right back in the hospital with an infection, DKA, gastroparesis symptoms, etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started couples counseling last year but it only lasted a couple of months.  I started therapy and seeing a medications-provider (pyschiatrist) at the same time.  I have VA care so I can use all the healthcare options they have available including couples counseling but it does not include my wife's personal care.  During counseling last year (\\~May 2018) our counselor asked to give our relationship 2 more months during counseling.  We did all kinds of \"homework\" like remembering how we felt when we were first together and all this emotional stuff, but, I don't think she understood(the therapist).  I LOVE my wife.  Deeply, strongly and faithfully.  I've never been unfaithful and I tell her everything.  She's the only person in the world I can literally be myself around and she won't hate me for it, at least that's how I feel.  But, I don't know if I explained everything right or what, but, my problems with my wife are tangible REAL problems, not emotional ones.  It was always difficult to get her in the mood for sex but now that she's been sick(3 years now), it's stopped pretty much completely.  When it DOES happen, it's awful for both of us.  I know that sex isn't everything so I've looked past that.  I've asked her at least 1,000 times to do any of the following:  A)  Get a job, go to work, do something.  B)  Apply for college, go back to school, get some student loans, etc.  C)  Apply for disability.  If you're too sick to work, then you must be disabled.  With disability and/or a job comes health insurance, with health insurance you can see the doctors you need to see.  With doctors comes the inevitable healthier lifestyle and therefore positive changes in her health.  I gave the counselor the two months she asked for and I thought HARD about my relationship for months, I'm still thinking about it.  That August, I told my wife that I had made my decision and I wanted to separate.  I told her that I wanted our daughter to finish 6th grade before we split up the family.  She just started middle school and is in band for the first time and she's really been struggling to find herself this year.  I love our daughter as much as I love my wife.  I have asked and begged and pleaded my wife not to take her away from me like we did her biological father.  She swears she's going to let me continue being her \"dad\" forever.  I have every intention of taking care of her until I'm incapable of doing so.  Here's the dad thing too - we've lost 2 babies to miscarriage and had 1 early pregnancy loss during our 10+year relationship.  I have no biological children and that bothers me a lot.  She knows and we've NEVER used protection, birth control, nor have I ever really pulled out.  We know that we SHOULDN'T have more children because it would endanger her life but she wanted to give me a child and I wanted to give her one.  Fortunately, now, that never happened.  It now appears that we will never conceive a child of our own nor will she ever DO ANYTHING with her life nor will she ever be able to drive herself again nor will she be able to take care of her own daughter by herself.  In the last 2 years she's missed Halloween, Christmas, first period, Thanksgiving...and more that I can't think of, because she was in the hospital.    \n\n\nI don't blame her for being a diabetic, I don't blame her for all of the things that \"just happened\" to her.  I DO, however, blame her for her poor choices in taking care of herself.  I DO blame her for NOT CARING ENOUGH about her own life to get herself right for our daughter.  I have a small glimmer of hope, less than 1% chance, that she'll let our daughter stay with me when we separate.  I gave her almost an entire year to figure something out and here we are, 3 months away from the date that was set and she's WORSE now than last year instead of better.    \n\n\nTL;DR:  Type 1 diabetic wife doesn't take care of herself, has serious complications from it, has no intentions of fixing anything or getting healthier and has been quoted as saying \"I just want to get her to 18\" (our daughter).  I'm letting her stay with me and I'm still taking care of her until May when we \"separate\" - probably followed by divorce.    \n\n\nAITA?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is really hard for me to post because I have anxiety really bad and I think everyone is going to be angry at me.  I'm not a bad person, just in a bad situation and I don't see any other solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She's in a serious relationship and has been for a while, so since a friend of ours got married over the weekend she's had weddings on the mind. I teased her about basically planning her whole wedding since then and she told me she'd planned nearly everything, except who her maid of honor would be. She basically told me that I would only be hers if I promised that she'd be mine. For some background, she's not close to any of her family and has no close siblings. I'm her closest friend, so when the time comes then I'd assumed she'd pick me, because there really isn't anyone else who would make sense. In contrast, I come from a very large family, and despite many brothers, I only have one sister, who I'm pretty close to. I told my friend many years ago, probably around 8th grade, that I'd like my sister to be my maid of honor when I get married because she's my only sister, and that made sense to me. She knows this, she was offended at the time, but she knows it's important to me. The last time we talked about it I basically just said that there's no way that I'd be able to plan anything about my wedding now, and that we can worry about it later on. After she made that condition today I just made a joke about how she'd be waiting a long time to tie the knot if she had to wait for me to do it first, and then after I didn't promise her that she stopped texting me back at all. She'll get over it (I'm not scared she won't talk to me or anything), but is it unreasonable for me to expect to be her maid of honor if I can't promise she'd be mine, or is it unreasonable that she's making a fight over something that probably won't be an issue for at least a decade?

We had many similar interests and he had actually gone on vacation with my family the year before. \n\nAnyway, a bit into the first semester everything is ok, sometimes he’d ignore me if I tried to talk or would just walk in and out without acknowledging me, but overall it wasn’t too bad. Eventually pledge week at college rolled around and he pledged and I didn’t. Everyone that I knew pledged, and it was really hard for me to be the only one that wasn’t. I had the option to but long story short it really wasn’t for me. Anyway I spent most of the week depressed and lonely because everyone I knew was so busy and couldn’t even talk to me due to pledge week. I had a panic attack one day and my parents came down to make sure I was ok even. By the end of the week I was doing a better and was more stable. One of my other friends informed Dan that I was having a rough week at the beginning of pledge week and needed a good friend. Dan ignored me all week. That Saturday Dan was sick from pledge week, and I went to lunch with a friend. While at lunch Dan messaged me and went off about me needing to change my attitude before I came back to the room. And continued to go off at me. I asked why he was acting like that because I hadn’t done anything and he just kept on. I eventually ended up breaking down in my friends car due to this. The next day I decided to confront Dan on what he’d done. He claimed that he never sent those messages (they were on Snapchat) and began to scream at me and told me to go to hell. That night he ended up in the hospital, so the whole argument had no effect.\n\nOnto before Thanksgiving break, everything is perfectly fine between us. Then once break happens he invites our old friend group from home to hang out multiple times and excludes me. He ignored me in person one day on break. Upon returning to campus he continued giving me the silent treatment. Rarely replying to me and looking away when I walked in. He would blare music in the room when I was trying to work or sleep, and would slam the door when he left the room. All of this caused a substantial amount of stress on me. Near the end of the semester I told him that I was moving out. I started to explain that it was just a stressful situation and I didn’t want any hard feelings (it’s not you it’s me), and he interrupted and said if I didn’t want to be there then I didn’t want to be there and that’s all there is to it. We didn’t talk again until winter break. I moved out and headed home and he sent me a text message saying “Since you left without saying bye, bye have a good break” he hasn’t talked to me since and I’ve since found out that he’s gone to his and my friends telling them I stopped talking to him and was an asshole to him this whole time, and some of them take his side.

Y took this to say, \"Ooh look at the couple, couple of the yeeeaarrr\" which caused our president to snap and say \"Fuck off. Really. Fuck off\" Y was a bit taken aback and apologized several times.

She kept asking why after I specifically told her. \n\nIn a few more events, she says extremely depressing shit all day everyday, makes inappropriate and uncomfortable jokes all the time, especially when I'm eating, and constantly puts herself down even when a whole bunch of people tell her the complete opposite. \n\nNow I know I can be strong with my words, and I don't like to hurt others said words, but I couldn't hold it anymore.

It's been about 10 years since I've eaten anything with meat in it on purpose. This is relevant to the story because I don't feel like my dietary preferences are respected during Thanksgiving. Almost everything has meat in it. I'm left with mashed potatoes and bread, and I really don't like the texture of mashed potatoes either so I'm stuck with bread. I've tried to discuss with my mother, but she doesn't really respect my diet either, and her family thinks it's just a phase. On top of that, her family is extremely Catholic. That alone doesn't bother me, but I'm gay, and they're very homophobic. They don't know I'm gay yet, but it still gets really uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend Logan, who is vegan invited me to his house for Thanksgiving. His family likes me and they are respectful of his veganism, so there's a lot of vegen food there. There's fake meat (which I don't like either) but they also just have normal food that happens not to contain meat or meat substitutes. Naturally, this was appealing and I told my mom that I'd prefer to go to Logan's house for Thanksgiving because I feel my diet is better respected there.\n\nShe told me the usual, that I was a kid and not supposed to make those kinds of choices, that there is still food I can eat (but as mentioned before, she means mashed potatos and bread), and that I should cherish and spend time with my family.

The important people in my life know, I've sent them pics of us together and that's it.\n\nHer son can't get off snapchat and constantly lies and advertises that he's drinking underage and using drugs (another story, it's being worked out). I just don't like putting my life on display.\n\nI said I'm not changing my mind on this, facebook doesn't define my relationships and if she wants to end it over somthing as petty as this, then go for it. Her friend is already telling her to end it, which taking advice from here is backwards since she is dumping/getting back together with this guy all the time over stupid stuff. I think this is more an insecurity thing and at this age, shouldn't be. This is high school drama to me and is unecessary.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. ",

            "input": "My SO wanted an outfit matching a particular dress code for an upcoming LARP (live action role play). It was a Friday evening and the LARP was scheduled for the next evening, and the dress code was pretty simple (pants &amp; long sleeve shirt, no collar). The dress code was 100% optional and only intended as a means of getting into character. The LARP only had about 20 people in it, and it wasn’t any official event or anything, just something to do for fun.\n\nMy partner drove me to the thrift store to help choose a shirt, which again, could have been almost anything, and was totally optional. We didn’t check the hours beforehand, and when we got there, we noticed that the store closed at 6. It was 5:46. \n\nAs a rule, I try not to enter a store less than 30 minutes before closing. I know retail workers are generally expected to have the store closed and cleaned by closing time, and I don’t want to be a dick to retail employees who need to close the cash register. Whenever I’m with someone who wants to enter a store that close to closing, I am super apologetic and try to make sure we leave as soon as possible. My partner knows this.\n\nMy SO, who is a retail worker, insists that the store is open, so customers can still be there, and that the employees just have to deal with it. \n\nWe went inside, and the cashier, the only worker, informed us that the store closed in 5 minutes. My partner made a remark towards me that she was rushing us out early and was annoyed by that, insisting that we had time. \n\nI looked through the dvds while my SO looked for shirts. I thought my SO could handle finding a shirt alone, and figured I was around for consulting if necessary but didn’t need to help look. Meanwhile, the cashier was getting more and more annoyed. A couple more people walked in, and she informed them that the store was closing soon.\n\nSO keeps asking my opinion on every shirt and then rejecting every single one. I say to just pick one so we can leave. SO tries on a couple, can’t decide, and keeps putting them on the rejected clothing rack. I see something I want and decide to buy it, go up to the cashier and pay for my item, apologizing for being there so close to closing. Cashier, visibly annoyed, says nothing. \n\nMy SO comes out of the dressing room a but later, pays and reminds me to pay for my item. I say I already paid for it, like 10 minutes ago. I get a snarky response and my SO gets upset at me for rushing us and being annoyed that it took so long. We leave the store and my SO points out that we weren’t even the last ones to enter or leave the store. I say I don’t feel comfortable being in a store that close to closing.\n\nThe cashier was clearly rude here and shouldn’t have been rushing us, but I think she was perfectly justified in wanting us out sooner. I think we were assholes just for being in the store, but was I the asshole for getting upset that my partner took so long?",

My husband has quite a large friend group that I have met over the years. We have pretty close relationships with several of his friends and others that we have maintained a more of an aquantaince relationship with. Due to us living in the same area he grew up in, most of these relationships were from his younger/college years.\n\nAbout a month ago we were at a party for one of his friends that he went to high school/college with. The party itself was fine and everyone was very nice. Most of the people there I had not met yet so he went and introduced me to a bunch of his olds friends. We ended up talking with one couple in particular for a majority of the time and they seemed really nice and nothing felt out of place or weird. My husband and the other husband said we should all get together sometime to hang out.\n\nThis weekend we finally had dinner with them this past weekend. Nothing overly weird or awful happened but I kept noticing the wife giving my husband odd looks and looking vaguely uncomfortable when we were talking one on one and making offhand comments that alluded to her knowing my husband better than me which I didn't pick up at the time but when I thought about it later on that night it seemed like weird things to say. \n\nSo, Sunday night I come out and ask my husband if they maybe had dated during high school/college. He said no, you know I didn't really date much at this time (he has told me previously that he slept around with pretty much anyone and didn't seriously date until he was 23). Naturally I ask if they have had a relationship outside of dating and he explains that he had a pretty steady physical relationship that continued for about 4 years when she moved for a new job.\n\nAt that time I no longer felt the need/want to continue hanging out with this couple. My husband got confused and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained that I didn't want us to maintain a relationship with someone he had been intimate for so long with. He thought that was dumb and made a comment to the fact that she didn't seem to have an issue with it. I argued that based off of her reaction, she possibly did have an issue with it. I also said that I was surprised her husband even wanted us to hang out, and that is when my husband said that he doesn't think her husband actually knows about their relationship. \n\nThis snowballed into a huge fight and I said that it wasn't up for discussion and he called me crazy and insecure for assuming anything would happen between the 2 of them now. AITA?\n\nTldr: hang out with a couple my husband went to school with, found out later that he slept with the wife and I no longer want us to maintain a relationship with them. ",

            "input": "Okay so there's quite a bit to this story but I'll try my best to explain it as neutral and equal as possible. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half now and it's been a bumpy road pretty much the whole time. We met 3 years ago but kept it casual for a long time as I didn't feel ready for a relationship due to trust issues on my end which I was very up front about to her,  I'd say that we are still in love but it's definitely a very distant love where neither of us can talk to each other about anything (all this leads up to my main point.) Our sex life has been getting worse and worse over the months and has always been quite dry compared to what I like which has always made distance between us as I see it as an important part of a healthy relationship which she disagrees with. There's much more but I'll get to the main point.\n\nEND OF THE BRIEF BACK STORY\n\nSo this has been something I've been doing quite recently where she'll either go somewhere or listen to a certain person that I think is quite honestly stupid and without logic. For example she works in a mostly female work force so there's a lot of bitching and people making up things about others which she has been caught on the middle of as of now. 2 specific girls started lying and picking on her friend and actually made a complaint to the boss about the lies they'd made up about my girlfriend and her friend. This has caused my girlfriend a lot of stress so obviously being her boyfriend I've told her to stop getting involved with girls like that as they are just causing her stress and making her miserable at home which she just shruggs off ebeb though she told me that it makes her feel that way. Fast forward to a couple of nights ago when one of those girls lying about her texts her asking to meet up at 11:30PM basically crying for attention hecause no else will come out and even though all the shit she made my girl feel and all the lies she made up about her, my girl goes to meet up eith her and be a shoulder to cry on which I obviously question and say that shes playing you and just making a fool out of you. Then she says that its \"my choice what I do and you shouldn't question me.\" This made me confused as I thought it seemed like common sense to not go but obviously I was wrong as I spoke my concern about what she'll say and maybe even start a fight to which my girl just shrugged her shoulders and left. Another example was a night when she was just going out with some friends to a bar which I was completely fine with until it got to about 1:30 in the morning which was odd because she had work the next day. I tried calling her to check up and she didn't answer after another few times of calling which got me worried because I didn't hear from her since 5PM that evening and I had no idea where she could be or if she was safe. An hour and a half passes and I get a call from her saying she's on her way back to which I respond with telling her of the worry I was in and how scared it had made me. She tells me that she was going to come back earlier but one of the guys in her group had just gone through a break up so she was trying to give advice and help talk to him for the past couple of hours which made me flip my shit as she knows of the distressing past mental abuse I suffered from other relationships and the trust issues I face every day. I've told her about these things so she understands my thought process and how I put things together in my head. However it didn't occur to her that I'd be pissed about her fixing another boys issues while simultaneously causing more for me by not even sending a single message saying what time she'll be back or if she was even alive. I critized how she thought that was okay and how she would think I wouldn't worry with the issues I've told her about time and time again. There are more instances of similar situations but you get the image, I'm not saying that any of this isn't my faults because I do believe it's my fault but I definitely don't think I'm an asshole with how open I've been about her about these issues and that it will affect the relationship.\n\nIn short: AITA for being annoyed about said situations and questions her mental logic to do certain things that she knows won't end well or are just letting her get used by others?",

My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn’t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can’t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me “I’m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I’m a piece of shit.” I’m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven’t put forth the effort to speak to them either.

From the ages of 14-18ish my life was chaotic because of situations I put myself in. I was constantly gossiping about people, spreading other people’s secrets, getting way too drunk, victimizing myself when things would go wrong, talking about vulgar things a work to get attention (like going into extreme detail about my sex life to coworkers I barely spoke to), etc. \n\nWhen I was 18 and had dropped out of college after graduating 2nd in my class in high school, I realized I didn’t like the person I was becoming and was embarrassed by my actions. So from there it took a lot of mindfulness and practice to be a better person, and although I still sometimes catch myself starting to do my past behaviors, I do genuinely feel like I’m a good person that makes a positive impact on other people’s lives. \n\nNow to the current situation:\n\nI have a best friend, D, who I’ve been close with since middle school.  She loves having big groups of friends rather than close, individual friends so she always wants me to hang out with her friends.  The problem is, most of her friends act the way I did when I was 18. It was so so hard for me to break those habits so I don’t want those behaviors around me. \n\nFor example, D’s other best friend, H, is constantly flirting with married coworkers and slept with her ex’s brother to make him jealous.  I don’t want to be around H because it frustrates me to hear these stories and I don’t want that kind of toxic energy around me anymore. I figured since I haven’t known her very long (only a few months) it wouldn’t be very damaging to stop the friendship.   D told me I was being very judgmental about situations that don’t affect me at all and can just be funny stories to hear about. \n\nAnother example is with D’s friend A. Long story short, A had a one night stand with a guy, the guy didn’t want a relationship, so she’s been harassing him for the past YEAR, lied about aborting his kid (she was never pregnant), stalks his current girlfriend, creates fake profiles and phone numbers to contact him since he blocks her every time, etc. When he rejects her, she cuts her arm and sends him pictures. I don’t want all that in my life. D says I shouldn’t take it too seriously since A isn’t hurting me directly. \n\nSo, AITA for judging these people and not wanting to be friends with them?\n\nTl;dr My best friend has very chaotic (imo) people in her life that I don’t want in mine.

Whatever though, it is her choice. \n\nAnyway, recently I've noticed she's becoming a bit chubbier. I casually mentioned it to her. She said she was 'too busy' to go to the gym. I asked her what she was busy with? She just shrugged and said that she just is.

We met online, and it wasn't until college that we started phone/videocalling, and started dating. \n\nWe've had a myriad of issues and been on again/off again for the past two years, but a big conflict has been his parents. Partially, this was due to how they talked about me -- it was super long distance, so I never talked to them, but his mom literally sat him down and told him she was afraid I was going to be his \"foreign wife\" (apparently a bible reference, saying that I was going to ruin his faith, as I am in fact very white and American). But the biggest part of it was that in the beginning of the relationship, I was extremely blunt about my thoughts on how he was raised. Specifically, I stated that I believed that any parents who were complicit in the abuse of their child were themselves child abusers. (His sister was mentally and physically abusive, and taking up too many parental resources, so they sent him to a private school, which was admittedly expensive and amazing EXCEPT for the person who started mentally and physically abusing the boys. He told me himself that they had proof, and their concerns were brushed off/they were not believed. He was eventually believed and pulled out.)\n\n\nAs you can imagine, this did not go over well. Most people do not want to hear that their SO thinks their parents are child abusers, especially if they are still in denial about having PTSD (he has now accepted that and went to therapy for several months). \n\nAfter being in therapy myself (this was my seventh attempt at therapy, after a run of bizarre bad luck where I had many who gave me a) AA prayer b) advice to be a Wiccan and have lots of BDSM sex with strangers and c) a single breathing technique before throwing up their hands and giving up), my therapist and I decided that my approval of his parents shouldn't really matter. My new mantra was going to be that as long as *he* thought they did their best, that was what mattered. However, we didn't see any obligation on my part to actively agree with the idea that people in close contact to children -- e.g. parents or faculty at a boarding school --, have no obligation to protect those children from abuse. \n\nWe are 20/21.

My manager said next time someone mentions the smell she will be going to corporate to speak about firing this girl or giving her some type of class on hygiene. Both of which would be embarrassing. Anyway, she smelled perfectly fine but this lasted for a week.\n\nFast forward to today, she smelled so bad that me and some other employees could not even stand to be in the same room as her.

I don’t tell many people that I have a disability that basically makes everything I feel extremely intense, sadness, happiness, everything. I get upset a lot because of it and I don’t want people feeling bad because they didn’t technically do anything so I normally never say anything. I also hate using my disability as an excuse but it is important to mention in this story.\n\nWhat’s also important to mention is that I spent three months in an extremely abusive relationship prior to moving to university. I never did anything about the relationship because I was convinced that I was over reacting due to my disability and my manipulative partner told me the same.\n\nA friend of mine, let’s call him weeb, knee all of the above. He was someone I trusted a lot and he knew and the insides and out. \n\nWe were at the bar and I was alone at the table while everyone else was playing pool. I didn’t know how to play pool so I didn’t want to humiliate myself by going up there. Another friend of mine (let’s call this one memes) came up to me and asked why I was sitting alone and I explained. They said that I should come up anyway so I did. I went up and joined in on a great conversation. It was a blast.\n\nBut that’s when Weeb told me to move out of the way of the pool stick thing. So I did. Then he asked me to move more when I was clearly out of range of it (unless home runs are a thing in pool?). So he says “go away, you’re not wanted” and he pushed me so hard that I still have a bruise from where he touched me.\n\nI got really upset by this. He knew everything that I had been through. He knew how many times I had been pushed down a set of stairs. He knew how much I was hit, and kicked and everything. He knew. I went to the ladies and I cried. I didn’t want to make a thing out of it because I often over react to everything and it’s just easier to hide. That way the only feelings that are hurt are mine.\n\nThen another friend came in, let’s call him cloud. I was really surprised that he came into the ladies as he was transitioning. Coming back into the ladies must have been really upsetting for him but he wanted to console me. I was very thankful for that. I told him what happened and the context in which it happens (as vaguely as possible - I didn’t want to name names and I didn’t want to go into the exact depths of my abuse). \n\nCloud told me that I should go and speak to whoever upset me and talk to them about it. So I did... just not the way that Cloud recommended.\n\nI walked up to Weeb who was at the bar ordering more drinks with memes and I aggressively ask him “was there really a need to push me that hard” and Weeb says “I didn’t even touch you”. I responded with “but you did” and he rolls his eyes and turned away from me. I got so offended, Memes and I made contact and he had “oh teas gonna spill eyes”. \n\nI turned away and just sat by myself for the rest of the evening. When we were saying goodbyes I hugged everyone but Weeb and I said to Weeb “we need to talk when we’re sober” and he gave me major stink eye as he said “do we”. I said “yes we do.” And I walked home alone at 2am.\n\nAITA for aggressively confronting someone about something personal in front of their best friend?",

He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. ",

We were talking on the couch, started making food, and then she invited some friends she hasn’t seen in a while over. Three guys came over and as soon as they got there, one of the guys kept telling me how I need to “get out and go home because you know what’s going down.” I never met these guys before and thought they were just playing and being drunk until the big friend decked me and I went flying into the wall. The friend in the back started screaming what are you doing?? On the floor, clearly not in a good position to start a fight, I went to leave and the big friend pushed me out the door and I again went flying into the wall outside the apartment. Then went to my nearby friends place, and called the cops from my friends phone. I then went back because my shirt, wallet, keys, and phone were still at her place. Outside her door my shirts thrown in the middle of the hallway. I slowly open the door, and was told to get lost because “stuff was going down.” As I was walking down the hallway I hear, “Hey pussy want your stuff back?”. So I go back and they throw my stuff on the ground. I thought I could hear my friend crying/in distress in the room but I could also be mistaken. So then I called the cops, told them I thought there was a rape occurring at that address. They show up to knock on the door and there’s no answer. \n\nIt’s the morning after, I for whatever reason couldn’t get much sleep last night. Woke up to texts from a different friend told me that it was wrong of me to do that because my friend was underage drinking, that guy was her ex-boyfriend and everything was fine. \n\nHaven’t heard from the friend despite me texting her. AITA for calling the cops? How should I’ve handled the situation, I thought about taking the guys on (wasn’t sober myself) but it was 3 on 1 and I was in no state to fight given how drunk I was.

I honestly didn't know what to say, I was actually kind of shocked someone would act that way. She walked away and stood on the other side of the baggage claim throwing daggers at me.

Also, English is not my first language so my apologies if I mess up.\n\nSome background info: I'm a bit of a recluse. I work from home and love love love it. But, there are times that I don't have to leave the house for a few days. Not that I don't want to, I just don't have to. As I live in an apartment building and the mailboxes are all downstairs, I don't check my mail every day. I rarely get mail anyway, everything is digital these days. I only get spam and some local newspaper. And mail addressed to the previous owners.\n\nI bought this house a few years ago, in August, and moved in in November 2012. The previous owners were somewhere in their 80s and moved to an assisted living facility about a mile away. It's on the way to the cinema and my parents.\n\nAfter I moved in I received a considerable amount of mail for them. I would collect it and when I went to the movies about twice a month I would drop it off in their mailbox at the front desk.\n\nEvery once in a while I would receive a mourning card for them. I didn't open them, I don't even think I'm allowed to, but I would jump in my car and drop it off, because I wasn't sure when the card had arrived. This happened a few times in the first few years. Sometimes it was late and I would wait until the next morning to drop it off.\n\nSo two years ago. I had been living there for 4,5 years. I received two mourning cards within a few weeks. I dropped the first one off immediately. The second one... well crap. Something went wrong. I put it in my bag to drop it off but I wasn't feeling well and got distracted. I suck. I spent the weekend on the couch like a coughing corpse and totally forgot about it. It took me three days to drop it off. And I didn't even know when the card had arrived in the first place. Shit.\n\nI dropped it off in the morning and the next day I received a letter. From the former owners of this house. They were mad as hell, because they had missed the funeral. Apparently the funeral was on the morning that I had dropped off the card. Oh shit. They asked me why I hadn't given them a call so they could have picked up the card (I don't even have their number. Luckily they didn't have my number either otherwise they would have called me. Dodged a bullet there). They were upset and condescending and calling me irresponsible and selfish.\n\nI didn't do it on purpose and it had been over 4,5 years since I moved in, why in the name of fuck do I still get your mail? What if I was on vacation or in the hospital or god knows what? But I still feel guilty, although my friends and family tell me not to, especially after their shitty letter. There was some more correspondence after this in which they acted like five year olds, but it doesn't change the fact that I was late delivering the card.",

It means I get extra/too-much heat and A/C at times. \n\nThe situation:\n\nMy dad walked in a few days ago and told me that I should cover one of my vents, because I had the window open for an hour to air out my room (nasty smell, probably from a shower and humidity) and he thought I was doing it because I was hot. I explicitly told him no, I won't do that. It's a bad idea (even if you don't include the fire risk) to cover it with cardboard, because it causes a reverse flow and damages the system in the long run by forcing it to work harder, and it would still result in the same amount of heat being redirected to one vent (best case scenario two-three of other rooms, but not with the way our house is laid out). I've called numerous AC/Heater repairmen, and asked them about this, because I wanted to do it way back. Almost every single one of them told me it was a bad idea. That, added with the bonus of me looking it up myself, dissuaded me from that idea. \n\nI came home the other day, and saw that, in fact, my dad had ignored my wishes, which was normal at this point in time, and did it anyway. I do live with him, and I am aware that he owns the house. That being said, I would assume that any rational human being would want to avoid being roasted alive by their own A/C system, so I took it down and reverted to my previous solution: just wearing more or less clothes based on how hot/cold I am when I go to sleep. Walking around in shorts and a T-shirt isn't bad at all, either. \n\nHe walked in today and exploded at me, for defying his authority and taking down a piece of cardboard held up by masking tape. I told him I slept in that room and I should have some opinion, but he said it was his house. I told him I would just sleep on the couch and he told me I could sleep on the street for all he cares. He then went and got a ladder and put it back up, telling me that I would see what would happen if I took it down again.\n\nEveryone on his side of the family (grandparents) agree with him, think that I shouldn't \"defy my father\" and call me a problem child for even arguing with him at all. They basically told me that if I didn't like what my dad was doing, I could move out with no support from anyone. My sisters think the man is crazy. I personally want to move out soon, but not before actually being able to.\n\nAITA?",

Few days ago, police show up at the house to arrest him on outstanding warrants, child neglect, and lots of other stuff. He ran back inside the house after announcing he was going to get a gun. He was shot by police and later died at the hospital.\n\nAnyways, this guy used to live with my family growing up. He was a criminal from a very young age. He stole hundreds of dollars from my parents including electronics.  When he lived with us, he did mean things to me (I was around 12 at the time.) I would be afraid to sleep because he would put random objects like erasers, paperclips, pencils, even food in my mouth. I would wake up with this stuff in my mouth. Always surprised I never choked on it. There were other incidents where he would barge into the bathroom while I was using it and would proceed to laugh and make fun of me.\n\nI never told my parents because to them, kids always lie and make stuff up (my sister used to make shit up all the time so therefore we were all liars.) So I always kept quiet about it. Well I recently told my parents what went on and they both gave me this super shocked look like I was making it up. My mom thinks I should be sympathetic towards the man's death but I honestly feel nothing. I told her that I didn't think people deserved to be shot, but his death wasn't a surprise to me. \n\nI also don't have much to do with my brother as he is a criminal himself. Mom is upset I refuse to console or talk to him about it. I don't allow him to have my phone number because he can get pretty annoying (asking for money, stuff, etc.) He's been asking my parents for my number and I will be pretty upset if they give it out.

I was excited and I said yes immediately and was looking forward to our future together. \n\nAbout 2 months later I notice that she's becoming increasingly stressed for seemingly no reason. I worry a lot about her because she has been diagnosed bipolar in the past and though she was pretty much fine in the last 2 years I was worried it was resurfacing. She was also having a lot of trouble with some of the people I considered my friends at the time who were pushing her away and trying to create space between me and her which was driving her crazy (as they were supposed to be her friends as well). \n\nI was obviously sympathetic to her as I cared about her a lot and wanted to make sure my girlfriend now-fiance was doing okay. So I tried to help her out, encouraged her to meet people and make friends as I figured that would be healthy for her. I suggested therapy and possibly medication as it appeared the Bipolar symptoms were re-surfacing but she refused that for a time as she didn't want to go back on meds.\n\nA little more time goes on, it's now apparent that bi-polar is really kicking in and she began telling me things like \"I don't know if I can even feel love right now\". During this time she has become increasingly close to one our co-workers (we all worked in the same place.) At first to me it's fine, I think it's good for her to have her own friends. As time goes on they spend increasing amounts of time together while spending a less than average amount of time with me. After a bit I outright ask if there is any feelings or anything I should be worried about there and she denies it completely insisting that it's nothing.\n\nPass a little more time, he comes into work with a hickey on his neck and I pretty much knew something was up. My friends (unknowingly to me) invite this guy to a party, get him drunk and ask about the hickey horrified to figure out that it was from my Fiance at the time. They let me know, I let her know I know, and then interestingly she breaks it off with both me and the other guy (though they are still friends) and comes to me to apologize.\n\nThis is where it gets complicated. She came to me apologizing and crying about what had happened. How it was the worst mistake in her life and she regrets everything that she did. She tells me she doesn't know what to do without me in her life and she doesn't want to lose me. And honestly, I think she was sincere, and I don't think she would do this again.\n\nHowever that was about 6 months ago. Since then me and her have been in a sort limbo. After about a month I began telling her that I do care about her and want whats best for her and things could be worked out with a lot of talking and time. She was telling me she doesn't know what she wants  or whats healthy for her, or if she was even in the right mental state to make a decision like that. She told me that I might have to be okay with just being friends with her and not necessarily expect a relationship. Over time being told this over and over again, though I offered her support and advised her to see professional help I began drifting away from her slowly.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after not having seen much of any progress at all being made, I told her I was ready to move on. It was hard because we both still cared about each other but it seemed apparent that  nothing was about to change. I left that day, and then she turned around the next morning now confident that she wanted to try to patch things up with me.\n\nTo me it's just feels like it's been a little too long and too late.\n\nTLDR: Fiance cheated, she apologized, I told her we could patch things up then 6 months later when she was ready I had moved on.\n\nAm I the asshole for saying we could patch things up then switching when she was ready?

TL;DR at end.)\n\nI’m a chef, I hired this guy as my sous almost two years ago.  He has diabetes.  He’s always sick, especially when it’s really inconvenient, like when I am out of town or when we have really busy weeks with lots of banquets or offsite events.  I brought it up to him in the past, if he thought stress exacerbated it, because whenever we were really busy and I needed his help, boom! in the hospital.\n\nEventually, I had to take him off of salary bc he was missing too much work and I told him, you know I don’t wanna fire you, I understand you don’t have control over this, blah blah blah, but I’m not paying you a salary when I can’t depend on you.  So I put him on an hourly wage instead and I promoted one of my other cooks as a sort of junior sous chef so I had a fall back for 1st sous chefs eventual sick days and to ease the stress on 1st sous so he wasn’t pushing himself so hard.\n\nHe’s got this stomach thing where it goes into paralysis and won’t digest the food sitting in this stomach and then when it starts pumping (?) again and drops all of the old food into his gut he gets really ill.  Apparently this happens with diabetes?  I have also, more than once, found him passed out on the floor of the employee room when he’s gone up for a shot.  When he gets sick and goes home I won’t hear from him for days and have to contact his sons to see if he’s dead.  I ask him about it after and he says he just comes to after days and has to look at a calendar to see how long he missed. \n\n1st sous chef has had this illness for 20 years.  He refuses to go to the doctor for regular treatment or even when he’s ill.  When I say “in the hospital” it’s because he gets so fucking sick that his kids call 911 (they’re all grown adults BTW).  He does take insulin, but that’s as far as any self treatment goes.  He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.  I know lots of other people with diabetes, my aunt for example has never ever had to go to the doctor for complications due to diabetes, neither did my friend in high school (and he was 17 and an idiot), and neither does my CURRENT prep cook, who ALSO has diabetes.  Because they take care of themselves! My prep cook brings himself little sugar free cookies and bananas to work with him and eats these cactus tortillas bc they have less sugar than corn. So it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with his constant sickness, not because of the inconvenience to me and the business, I solved that with 2nd sous chef, but because we’re all watching this dude kill himself in front of us and he’s the most stubborn mother fucker in the world and it’s breaking my heart.\n\nOk, so last Friday I’m up in my office doing some paperwork and go into the kitchen to check on things and 1st sous is gone, 2nd sous says he got really sick and left an hour earlier.  No big deal, we’re extra staffed with a new guy training so I’m not worried about it and leave at my normal time.  Saturday 1st sous is a no show, I text and call, but as usual hear nothing.  2nd Sous coincidentally lives with 1st, so I ask him if he’s okay and he says he hasn’t talked to him that he was asleep when he got home the night before and was still sleeping when he left for work in the morning.  My days off are Sun. and Mon. and 2nd sous is going out of town to visit his fam for Thanksgiving, so I assume I’m going to be working on both of my days off to cover for 1st sous.  C’est le vie, they’re super slow days so boring, but no biggie.\n\nTuesday comes and 1st sous comes in to talk to me.  We go outside and he tells me he found a diabetic ulcer on his foot and that it started to “stink” on Sunday.  He refuses to go the doctor bc he knows they’re going to tell him to amputate.  His plan is to cut off the dead tissue himself, apparently he’s done this before (…) and his friend gave him some weird oil shit that’s supposed to kill the infection before it can get into his blood stream (I forgot to mention, he says he is allergic to all antibiotics) I try and talk him out of it and tell him prosthesis have improved, he’ll be able to do everything he can now, no one will even be able to tell, but he won’t even consider it because HE WON’T STOP DRINKING AND SMOKING.  Like it’s his fucking life blood, I was like, what?!  You won’t stop smoking to have more time with your kids?   And he shrugged and said he’s raised 5 good men and they don’t need him.  Basically he wants me to give him two weeks to “get back to normal.”  In my opinion, he is not going to get back to normal.  He is going to ignore this until he gets blood poisoning and dies.  I told him that I think he shouldn’t waste what time he has left working and that he should spend it with his kids and he said, yeah maybe.\n\nThis situation has been really stressful in a lot of ways, I really care about him and I obviously don’t want him to fucking die and he was crying telling me and I was crying and it was all very awful.  After our talk he went back inside and drank a whiskey while I input invoices, so what can ya do, he’s not going to change for anything including his own life.\n\nThe owner of my place told me that I can’t fire him over this.  I said I’m not going to watch him commit suicide in front of me and that’s not fucking fair to the staff and that it’s not doing him any favors allowing him to continue working.  Every step he takes will be pushing the infection into his bloodstream (I’m not a doctor, but I believe you’re supposed to “off weight”?) It might seem callous, but I really don’t want to let him back.  I honestly think it would be better to fire him because if he was unemployed he could get Medicaid, maybe hospice care, maybe die with some dignity instead of fainting in the bathroom at the bar after a long shift without eating.  Even in the event that he pulls off some sort of miraculous hobo surgery on himself and gets all the necrotic tissue out, how long until it happens again?  His kids are all moving away, 2nd sous is moving out of their house, who’s going to call 911 next time? I worried I'm being selfish.  One of my cooks pointed out that maybe he really really loves cooking and wants to die doing it.  Ummm, I love cooking too, but I certainly would not be working myself into a grave were I in this situation, I love other things more. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR Sous chef is dying from complications from diabetes, refuses medical help, is literally going to cut away parts of his own foot, and wants me to hold his job for him until he recovers.  I think firing him is for his own good, the owner says I shouldn’t, am I the asshole?",

He made her uncomfortable, and that shouldn’t just go unnoticed. If I talk to this guy about it, am I an asshole for being selfish and not caring about her? Been pondering this for a while now.",

Hair accumulates on the machine washer's door and i figured that the filter might need a little bit of cleaning. I am living with my best friend in a rented apparent with one more guy. My friend and the other guy lived here before me and in my place lived a girl which I replaced. When i tried cleaning the filter, it got stuck because there were hair clips from the girl in the filter that jammed in between the filter and the washer, essentially getting the filter stuck. I couldn't put it in fully, i couldn't take it out.   \n\n\nThis is where the problem arises. My best friend (we've known each other since kindergarten, now we are 21-22) came in the kitchen and saw me fiddling with the filter and i told him it got stuck for unknown reasons ( at the time ). When he found out, he suddenly started blaming me and shaming me - \"Why don't you ask ME for \\*permission\\* to do things? Why do you do things on your own mind? Why do you think you can do everything on your own? Why do you think you can REPAIR the washing machine by yourself? Why do you think you know everything and can \\*fix\\* things on your own? Why do you constantly brake things that are none of your business? Why do you think you are a mechanic and feel the need to fiddle around? YOU BROKE THE WASHING MACHINE, I DON'T CARE, I WANT IT FIXED! Take responsibility for once in your life, you broke it and STOP complaining!\". Now, keep in mind that i haven't really fiddled with anything up to that point in that apt. I did tell him that its not my fault that it got stuck and i told him the reason why it happened, i followed the manual and i only wanted to clean out the filter which is something normal to do with a washing machine in my mind. I would've paid for repairs \\*if needed\\*, the thing was in warranty too, hell, i would've paid for the darn whole washing machine too.  \n\n\nSo am I the asshole? I only tried cleaning out the filter and it jammed for reasons beyond me.. I fixed the issue by myself and he didn't offer any help. Am i the asshole for \\*breaking\\* the washer and \\*complaining\\* that it is not my fault that this happened ( though i held responsibility to fix it ), or is my friend the asshole for shouting at me and pointing fingers at me and blaming me for absolutely everything possible? I asked my father and he said i am in the wrong since I got the filter stuck and I shouldn't be offended by my friend's reaction.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "input": "Hi y’all, just wanna get other people’s thoughts on this. I figured that if my mom wants her friend to go so badly, they should just plan their own trip, but let me explain. Sorry for the long read. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nThe Situation:\n\nBack when I graduated from high school, my mom’s graduation gift to me was “a ticket to the Philippines (redeemable at a future date).” This is in quotations because there was no actual ticket, rather it was a comment written in my grad card because 1) I had already told her that even though I wanted to go, I would be in school and didn’t know when I’d actually be able to go and 2) she couldn’t actually afford a ticket at the time. This becomes important later on (imo). \n \nThis past summer, I applied to medical school and was successful(!), so I’ll be starting this coming fall. That being said, I’ve been studying/working throughout college and after graduation to prep my application and save money to pay for aforementioned apps, so I’ve never really been able to take any vacations or trips. In this span of ~6 years, my mom has gone to the Philippines (without me, because I was in school) 3 times, each time for 3-4 weeks. \n\nSince I’ll start school in the fall, I’ve started to plan my last day at work, and when I’ll finally be taking my trip to the Philippines. I told my mom about this, and asked if she would come with me and if the offer for the free ticket was still on the table. She admitted that money was still tight (which didn’t surprise me because my dad is still unemployed), and that she probably wouldn’t be able to cover her ticket, let alone mine. I was fine with this though, since I’ve been working full time and have managed to start saving a bit (after finally paying off the ~$6k I spent of my own money to apply to med school in the first place). I really want my mom to come with me, because the first time I went to the PI was with her, and I’d like to be able to enjoy a trip with her again. My tagalog is also not the greatest, and even though I know enough to get by and some of my family members speak some english, things still get lost in translation. \n\nSince I want my mom to come with me, I crunched the numbers and figured I can afford to buy my mom’s ticket, so I offered to do so for her. This she happily accepted, and we started trying to plan out dates for the trip. The main point of this trip, at least, as I intended it, was to visit and spend time with family. It’s been almost 10 years since I’ve last gone, and my grandmother’s getting pretty up there in age. My mom knows this. \n\nAs we’re figuring out dates, my mom pulls out her phone, and calls her best friend, who we’ll call Marie. Cue her telling Marie about our upcoming trip, and telling her she should come with us. She spends a good half hour discussing logistics, places her friend can stay, and other touristy islands and places they could visit. Marie sounds excited for the trip and plans to come. \n\nAfter she hangs up, I ask my mom why she invited Marie, as I wanted it to be us two to visit family. Her response was basically “Marie has been wanting to come with me to the PI forever!!! We’re finally going, so of course she should come. I told her she could the next time I went.” \nOf course, I responded saying that I wanted it to be a family visit trip, not one where we’d go around to all the touristy places so she and her could take pics (this was what she was talking with her about). She basically brushed that aside and said “She’s been wanting to go for so long, so she has to come. Don’t be selfish.” As if I haven’t too??\n\nThis is really annoying me, since this isn’t at all what I intended it to be and I feel like the trip would be much different now if her best friend does come. I’m at the point where I almost want to not pay for my mom’s ticket anymore, because I wanted it to be a trip for me and her, not here and her friend. But of course, if I don’t pay, my mom won’t be coming with me and won’t be able to see her family. So, AITA here, and WIBTA if I did tell her I didn’t want to pay for her anymore?\n\nTL;DR: Mom invited her best friend on a trip to visit family that I was going to pay her way for and calls me selfish for not wanting the best friend to come because “she wants to go too.”\n",

They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n",

            "input": "To start off, I think some background would be helpful. I will say, I don't think I handled this whole situation well, but, well, it's a little late now. My husband Jacob and I have known each other for 5 years, and married for a few months. We live a state away from both of our families, but I've taken a weekend every 2 months to visit my family, while my husband chooses to ignore texts and calls from his family, and only initiates any communication between them if I'm in a group chat with him. This is important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this whole story starts almost 2 years ago. Jacob and I spent a few weeks in the summer visiting his mom and stepdad and while we were there, it came up that his sister would be visiting from a couple hours away. This worried us both because he had recently told me that when he was in high school and his sister was in college, she would sneak in bed with him and sleep in only a tank top and underwear, and then would leave before their parents would wake up. From what he told me, this continued on every time he visited her, or she visited him, unless her roommates were around. The visit didn't go well, he was meant to drop me off at a mall for some shopping because his sister had asked that she get time with only him, but I had been sick for a few days and still had fever and ended up fainting, so he called a friend and asked him to meet me at the mall, and then left once that was sorted to meet with his sister. Jacob was very late and his sister had driven through bad traffic and was understandably annoyed, and tensions rose until she finally left, only half an hour after meeting him. From what I understand, she left crying and called their dad, who then called my then fiance and chewed him out for making his sister upset. He was on his way to pick me up when the call happened, and as soon as he arrived he told me he was leaving to drive to where his sister lived to apologize for upsetting her in person and then stay the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this part is my fault. I was sick and upset that Jacob wanted to stay the night with his sister after what he had just told me, about the sleeping in the same bed, and yelled at him that at some point he had to stop sleeping with his sister. He ended up staying with me that night, and since then his relationship with his sister started to go downhill. She would send snapchats of herself in her bra and underwear and then if he didn't reply back, she would ask why he didn't talk to her anymore. Or, she would post said pictures on instagram or snapchat and then message him again, and this is taken directly from a screenshot of a message, she asked him why he didn't care about what she looked like. I would say that what really upset my husband, was when we were both at a family barbecue at a swimming lake and she pulled me aside to tell me to put some clothes on because my bikini was inappropriate to wear around Jacob, and that I should be more conscientious of what I wear because it reflects badly on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time Jacob contacted her was a few months later, they hadn't talked in months and I thought they should make up and move on, and so pressured him to call her because we were planning on getting married the next year. He called her during her lunch break at work and that ended in her saying to stop contacting her, that he wasn't her brother, that she didn't want to be associated with him until he became a better person, and that she never liked me and that he should make better choices in his life. At this point he completely cut contact with her and blocked her on all platforms. Because of all of this, and his family siding with his sister and bringing up that he was the one that had been creating a problem since he now refused to go to family events if she was there or even call his family because each time he did, they would tell him to call his sister and apologize and move on. We saw her once more at a family birthday party, but at that event she approached him and tried to hug him so he asked her to leave him alone, pushed her away when she didn't move away, and went to talk to the rest of the people in attendance. She then swore at us both, cried, and then as I was walking back to be by my husband after getting a drink, she shoulder checked me, spilling my drink, and almost causing me to fall. I guess the funny part here is that I have 4 inches and at least 30 pounds on her, and was still knocked off balance, which is why Jacob's mother asked me if I'd made the whole thing up. To be honest, I'm not even sure my husband would have believed me if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway now here we are, almost 2 years later, and we've since eloped, due to the family tensions we ended up canceling the wedding, and only his mom and my mom were in attendance as witnesses. Jacob's father got tired of not getting a response, and somehow managed to get my number over the Christmas holidays and began to message me. His sister got an award and the whole family went and he wanted to ask me if I could get my husband to go to the event. I told him I wouldn't be involving myself in this situation, and then on the day of the event, received another message asking if my husband could message his sister a congratulations, and that he had already written it for him and all my husband had to do was copy and paste. Again, he said no, and since then he's spent almost a month writing a message to his sister asking her to take down photos of him on her social media, and letting her know that after all the nasty things that have been said between the both of them, her inappropriate behavior over the summer, and the most recent fiasco at the birthday party, he was officially done with her, and he asked her to stay away from the both of us at family events from now on. She sent the message to both of their parents, and we ended up starting a whole other thing that we hadn't expected, all my husband had wanted was to be able to go to family events without worrying about what his sister would do. The drama finally died down yesterday, and ended with Jacob's father saying I was full of shit and out to hurt his family, and that he didn't need anything from me so I should knock it off. Jacob's mom told us both that we had to forgive and forget because this had gone on long enough and was hurting her and that she understood his sister had done bad things but that she hadn't initiated any contact with us since the birthday party in 4 months and that now we were the only ones causing problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my only question is, in all of these situations I feel like I've been the common denominator, and I know for a fact that had I not informed my husband that the things his sister did were inappropriate and showed him resources from r/JUSTNOFAMILY and r/NarcissisticAbuse, everyone would still be a happy family. I thought I was helping my husband by encouraging him to talk to his family about what his sister had said and done, and by making him go to his family's events, and then finally telling him that it was okay to want to officially end the relationship with his sister and reading over the message before he sent it, but all that's happened is he feels like he's lost his family and I feel like I'm the asshole. I do think he's been happier in these two years of low contact with his sister than in the 3 years I knew him when he talked to her everyday, but I can't help but feel like this is all my fault and I should've just let things go on like they were before. So. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: What was a small tiff with husband's sister has now lasted almost 2 years, and has led to my husband feeling like he has no family left, and me being cut off from his family.

She calls my friends and I “frat bros” even though none of us have ever been in a frat.  She says we’re toxic when we’re together as a group.  Disrespectful and harassing.  Harassing as in one of my friends will dare try to talk to a girl in a bar.  She also overheard us playing fuck,marry,kill once and lost her freaking mind over it.  \n\nShe’s no treat whenever she’s around her friends.  The are the catiest group of girls I’ve ever been around.  I’m not a very sensitive person, but even I’ve felt bad about some of the shit they will talk.  There’s this gay bar that they go to so they don’t have to deal with guys hitting on them.  Sometimes I’ll play DD for her.  One time I went in there and they had completely taken over the middle of the glowing dance floor thing.   There were a few guys who were able to dance on the very edge of it, they were taking up almost all the space on it.  I’ve also seen one of them grab someone’s crotch as we were leaving and they just laughed about it. \n\nShe also helps her self to anything in my fridge when we’re here.  Doesn’t ask, just takes.  I didn’t mind, I just assumed that that was the kind of relationship we had after that though.  When I was over at her’s though I went to check out what she had and there was this taco dip thing she had in a big pan.  It looked really good so I start putting some on a plate when she comes out.  She got irritated about it saying she was trying to make it last and actually made me scoop it back off the plate into the pan. \n\nThere’s been other minor things.  The only other one probably worth mentioning is that she shit talks her one friend who doesn’t work and lives with her boyfriend supporting her.   She’s said that she would never allow herself to live like that.  Relying on a partner for everything.  Literally besides our first date, she’s never even offered to go 50/50.  \n\nThis all probably sounds harsh.  She’s a lot more than these examples and I get excited every time I’m about to see her.   The hypocrisy has been rubbing me the wrong way for a while though and it’s not something I’ve been able to push out of my head or just ignore.  Like I said at the top, she calls out bullshit where ever she sees it.  I want to take a page out her book. ",

Some of my friends and I were talking in a group chat, and one of my friends (let’s call her Y) started sending very fake looking stock photos of people vomiting for some reason. Jokingly, I said “you should send those to X”. My friend actually sent them to her, and X called back sobbing and threatening to call the cops. \n     Y was understandably upset that I told her to send them, because I convinced her to send the photos and then she had to deal with X and her reaction. I thought Y knew about her phobia, and therefore wouldn’t send them to avoid triggering her. Y didn’t know, and sent her the photos because I told her to. I didn’t stop Y from sending the photos, but I didn’t really have much of a chance to as it was too late when I learned that she had actually sent them. The photos were very cartoonish and fake-looking, and I am having trouble believing that it would evoke such a response in her. X is known to overreact to everything and seek for attention. \n     The next day, I had a serious allergic reaction while I was running, and I started to go into anaphylactic shock. I had the worst itching of my life, my throat started to close up, I experienced the worse stomach cramps I’ve ever had, threw up multiple times, nearly shit myself, and I literally couldn’t walk so I had to be picked up in a truck by a park ranger and driven to the trail entrance so the ambulance could take me to the hospital. If it wasn’t for the two friends I had helping me and calling the park ranger, I could have died. The experience was traumatic for me and it took me a while to get over it. \n     I was still recovering from the physical symptoms of the allergic reaction when I heard X went around telling people that “going into anaphylactic shock was karma for what I did to her”. I can’t believe she thinks I deserve that for jokingly telling a friend to send her badly faked pictures of someone throwing up. I understand that phobias can be serious, but knowing her I feel like she overreacted and exaggerated her phobia for attention because that’s just the type of person she is. \n     Am I the asshole for telling Y to send those photos, even though I wasn’t serious? Am I justified in being upset at what X said, or did I deserve anaphylactic shock?\n     TL;DR: I used to be friends with someone who has a vomit phobia. As a joke, I tell one of my other friends to send her some obviously fake photos of people vomiting. She goes hysterical, cries and threatens to call the police.

My fiancee (28F) is only working part time right now at a coffee shop, roughly 20 hours a week or so for the past year while she finished up college courses. She just was accepted in nursing school and starts soon. Because of this, I mostly pay for our rent. We live comfortably thanks to my pay but I am not saving up much.

And I guess it’s possible IATA if I’m already thinking it.\n\nTL;DR- Constantly clingy friend has been smothering me. Contemplated telling her to stop it. While brainstorming points and considering factors on how to break this news in the most frank but sensitive way, clingy friend calls immediately to tell me she’s pregnant. Keeps saying things over and over again how I need to be there, guide her, and without context.\n\nFull version:\n\nMy best friend has been awfully clingy lately. So much I’ve gone out of my way to do favors for her, do whatever she wants, etc. She is grateful for the time spent and sometimes makes up for it by buying a gift as a token of appreciation but I’m usually wiped out before she asks for favors the next day. She’ll often point out how much I do for her too or tell others how I’d practically die for her. It’s strange..\n\nMy best friend will call me sometimes in the middle of the work week and ask if I have plans over the weekend. I love the advanced notice instead of springing news on me within 30 min. Before something’s happening; but because I feel smothered as it is I’m either trying to find an excuse to get out of a pre-invite, be stupidly honest and say nothing to where then she excitedly makes a schedule for US, or I tell her we actually do have plans with family or friends.\nBut it never fails.. the weekend rolls around and my phone will ding me at least three times a day “What are you up to now?” “Is your family gone?” “Are you home now from the movies?” “Can I come over and show my husband your new guest room?” “Okay then but can you come over instead perhaps, like, immediately?”\nMy husband is starting to find this behavior annoying and he shakes his head in disappointment at me if I can’t bare to firmly say, ‘No’ because I’m nervous to hurt her feelings or have a big blow up over it as we have had before 6 years ago.... calling me a bad friend because I never go out of my way to invite her over or do stuff. I just hope things are different now.\n\nAfter some Reddit advice and consideration, I start to brainstorm how to tell my friend I need space. That I love her, and will always be, but I feel sick. And sometimes my feelings are important and I need time alone to recharge, including the stressful texts. I try to ease my mind and settle down by doing some laundry when my phone blows up again. She’s calling.\n\nI answer it and think she’s hurt because she’s frantic and crying. Instead, she’s just announced she is pregnant. I’m honestly a little floored but still congratulate her and tell her it’s okay to cry and have mixed emotions as it’s a big thing. Before she can hang up to go tell her husband as he’s walking in the door, she cuts me off, “PROMISE ME YOULL BE THERE.” I answer “Sure.” Not really know what the heck that means. She says it again, “No, I’m serious. I need to know if you’re fully invested in this because I can’t do this alone. Promise me you’ll be there and stick through this, on my side—gotta go!” And hangs up.\n\nWhat does that even mean?...\n\nShe texts me five minutes later, “Come over right now?”\n\nI say no. I can’t. (A lie, although I am doing my bedding and it’s 7pm, I haven’t had dinner yet)\n\nShe texts me back, “What can I eat?”\n\nI respond, “Y’know... Considering your pregnant now you’re really going to have to do some research on x , y , z and know for yourself what you may like, the baby won’t. Stay away from the most commonly known bad food for pregnancies (caffeine, liquor, fish with high mercury, etc).”\n\nShe’s texted me back an hour later, “You swear you’ll help me right? Im panicking. I need you.”\n\nBut help with what?!? I’m not a professional, a doctor, an OBGYN, a nutritionist, a trainer, I’m not her husband, her mom, her doula, nor will I pay money to buy things as I have my own finances to worry about and I have to save up. (She’s seen things at stores and randomly asks me to buy them for her, even before pregnancy).  It’s not like I don’t have a choice as I’m not the one who’s pregnant and it’s not my kid/responsibility.\n\nSo reddit, before this goes down possibly horribly because I don’t know how she’ll react, AITA for not wanting to be there 100% of the time she’s pregnant or needs my help—or whatever it is she means? I have a life too.\n(I’m sure in our discussion I will ask her to specify her needs and what I can and cannot do for her.)\nI can assure you I will tell her I still love her.. and remain good friends.. but I can’t hold her hand the whole way. I don’t have kids and don’t want any still for a few more years. I am the last of my girl friends to ever conceive and I’ve been useful and helpful in ways but not there all the time.",

Noon rolls around and I ask my buddy where he is, to which I get no reply (as is quite common for him). So I think \"fuck it\" I can probably just lay down some drums and a bass and by the time they get here we will have something to work with. \n\n\nAbout an hour later I get a response from my friend saying \"we're visiting people, we'll probably be there after 5:00\". I'm a pretty easy going guy, so I'm like \"yeah no worries, just get here when you get here\".\n\n\n5:00pm rolls around and I send my buddy another message to which he replies at about 6:00 with \"I'll message you when we're going to your place\".

I ended up leaving for the clubs with my other friend and that was that.\n\n\nI messaged my friend today asking if his lass was ok, he said \"she's fine, she thought you were a decent dude but you were a bit insensitive and now she doesn't trust you\".\n\n\nAm I the asshole here guys?\n\n\n\n\n",

We had already told ourselves if there was ever any sign they might be getting hurt by their mom we'd report it, so when all that happened, we called. \n\nWe've never really met the family before, mostly because they seem pretty reserved. We reached out when they moved in but they didn't seem interested. Then, I think the mom thinks we ratted them out for having a dog against their lease (it barks all day so I'm sure one of the other neighbors reported them) and seemingly retaliated by making multiple false reports that our dog had been barking and attempting to get us in trouble with management. The reason I mention all this is because it seems clear the mom already doesn't think of us fondly.  She seems very hostile to her own children based on her constant yelling and swearing so we didn't talk to her before calling CPS in order to avoid any problems between us and her as neighbors. \n\nThe case worker followed up with me today noting there were no signs of abuse and told me a bit about how she's a single mom trying to make things work and is very upset by the whole scenario.

The reason we are long distance is because he got into a great teaching program in Japan (I am in the US). Once complete, he plans on coming home and marrying me. I have been keeping tabs on his recently added friends on Facebook. He has recently added some girls from his program. I am not a jealous type or anything and it is fine for him to meet other people, in fact I want him to enjoy a social life while away from me. While he has been away I decided to better myself by losing weight, eating healthy and attending a community college program. I am still living at home with my parents and have been working a job at a marketing company to help support the family. Money is tight, I feel like I need to be careful when purchasing anything. \n\nFor me to get to and from my job at the marketing company and then to the community college at night, I have to take public transportation. It is not glamorous, it is what I need to do. I know that my boyfriend will be making a decent salary as a teacher when he comes back to the US, but in the meantime, I have to take busses. Any time I am in public, I am at risk for a male talking to me. I disclose any flirtatious actions from men to my boyfriend as soon as it happens. So, I can usually tell the difference when someone is flirting versus making small talk. Well there was a nice underprivileged teenager that was riding with me and asked for my number. I clarified that I had a boyfriend and he said that he just wanted to be friends. So, I added him on snapchat to continue the dialogue in a similar way to how my boyfriend has been adding Japanese girls. I did not do this out of spite, but rather to try and be supportive if needed as his family is less supportive than mine. \n\nAnyways, I told my boyfriend once he woke up that I met a new friend on the bus and how I added him. He did not take this well. At all. He started screaming at me and accusing me of cheating on him. I felt like this was very unfair since I have been so supportive and trusting of his life while he has been away. He threatened to break up with me and instead I was able to push for us to go on a break instead. I didn’t do anything with anyone while we weren’t talking for three weeks. We just talked again last night, and I didn’t want to bring up other people because I thought it might trigger his distrust. I assumed that my boyfriend also had been loyal, but my heart was aching to know. He ended up bringing it up in a roundabout way and I told him that it was none of his business because he is the one that wanted the break. Anyways this resulted in him screaming at me. I told him if he buys me a car this problem wouldn’t happen on public transportation. He said that I need to get a job like everyone else. I feel lost.

Two friends of friends flew in before me and rented a car so they could go to the hotel first. I was picked up by my local friends and we had a great weekend in the city. On the day of departure, my local friends recommended I just ride with Jane and Kevin (the two aforementioned friends of friends) since they were on the way to the airport too. I agreed since it made sense for my local friends to go directly home and not waste time dropping me off if Jane and Kevin were going to the airport already. \nA few days later, I Venmo requested Jane and Kevin -and everyone else on the trip- food charges that we had eaten and split among the group. Kevin declined my request without any communication and sent back a request for gas. Now at this point I was a little confused since I had spoken to Jane (the one who had rented the car) and she had said gas wasn't an issue. The tank was only half empty when it was filled so with gas prices being around 3.50, I figured 20 bucks was the max that gas could cost - split among 3 would make it a little over 6 dollars. After declining my charge for food which was about 6 bucks, Kevin charged me an additional money for gas. I immediately declined the charge. Now several individuals who have been roped into this debacle are asking why I declined. Am I the asshole here? Is he? Both? Or is it just some miscommunication?",

Then a couple hours later I check her sc story and they're hanging out together. \n\nThey only came over if i had weed and we would hang out for 15 mins, smoke, then they would hang out together without me. Even when i hinted i wanted to go i was ignored. Since I'm a dramatic 16 year old girl i posted an indirect on my story that said \"i hate confrontation but this is hurting me\" (I now know that was immature but i was upset at the time) sally proceeds to text me and say \" if you dont want to be friends just say so lmao\" i lied and said it was for someone else because i have bad anxiety and attachment problems and losing people makes it worse (they knew this, i warned them before we where friends that i cant get too close because i will get extremely unstable when i lose people) \n\nCut forward to now and they just completely dropped me, and say passive agressive things on their story and at school. I just want to know if its my fault because what i posted, I'm not sure if i deserve this or not. ",

He never asks how my day is or bs that partners should ask each other. Our message conversations is me writing like 5 messages and him answering every few days. \n\nThis annoys me.

We are each other's emotional support through everything and we do everything together. Very recently, my phone broke down and I do not have the financial means to obtain a new one at the moment, so she being the saint that she is let me borrow her old phone that she kept around. When it has WiFi I can use things like snapchat and instagram just so I can contact her.\n\nIn using her old phone, all of her old apps and pictures (including her tinder) are available to me. She did not explicitly state anything about me not going through all of it when we weren't together, so I figure she just assumed I would, but I honestly have not whatsoever. I respect her boundaries and privacy, and figure most of the stuff I would find in there happened before we ever even met and I would not be happy with what I saw, so why even bother.\n\nThe problem here arrives when I received a notification about a day after I received her phone to use. I got a notification from instagram, but as her account. At this point I had not used the app yet, so her account was still signed in. However, when I opened the app to see what was up, it prompted me to log in - I could not use her account, yet I was still getting notifications from it. It was at this point that I was going to sign in with my own credentials so as to not get her notifications, but what I actually did I am slightly ashamed of. I read the notification and saw that it was not from anybody she normally talks to, or anybody that I know. It was from a man our age that goes to our university, and the contents of the messages made me not want to sign out. I became extremely anxious because his messages went something like this:\n\n\\- \"Hey\" (11pm the night before I saw)\n\n\\- \"Good morning Beautiful\" (the first notification I saw in the morning)\n\n\\- \"Were you at so-and-so's concert last night? I think I saw you\" (I took her to a nearby musician's concert for a celebration, I bought her tickets and just the two of us went)\n\n\\- \"What are you doing later?\"\n\nNow I cannot see her messages that she is responding to him because since I am receiving her notifications, I am only getting his messages. I do know that she was responding though based on the fact that he liked one of her messages that she sent to him. I also know that after the last message he sent there was no other contact. She does not have him on any other form of social media, so instagram notifications would let me know if anything else happened. I do not know what she said, if anything, to the last message.\n\nSo I suppose this is the question - AITA for not signing out of her account upon seeing those types of messages? Should I confront her about this, or let it slide for now as he seems to have stopped talking to her?",

She lives in a small city with a lot of stray cats and used to leave food outside for them, she knew their personalities and would name a few of them.  As I was leaving her place one night one of the cats approached me.  She got super excited because that one had always been super timid and stayed away from everyone.  But it started rubbing up against me, letting me pet her, letting me hold her, etc.  The ex basically talked me into taking the thing home with me, which I did because the cat had some kind of connection with me.\n\nThat week I brought her to the vet, got her shots, got her spayed, and got medicine for fleas and worms.  She was also very thin when I got her, so I made sure she had good food and occasionally wet food.  It's been over two years now and I am just completely apathetic to this animal.  Look I have been a good pet owner.  She goes to the vet regularly, I buy her toys and play with her, I even bought her a 6' tall cat perch thing that she likes a lot.  Her litterbox is always clean, she always has good food (never bought the super cheap stuff), and I make sure to spend time giving her attention.

But I'm also pretty sure the cat has already bonded with me pretty closely, and she's still very timid around anyone else.  So I'm not sure if giving her up wouldn't even be best for the cat at this point.  I was going to give her up within a few months of getting her, but felt super guilty about it and decided not to.

I tell him I treat everyone the same way, I always take the money first, that's just the rules.\n\nImportant detail: this guy isn't white.

It’s a 2 hour car drive from our city - which admittedly isn’t much, but my father is usually the one who drives and he always gets exhausted after these kind of trips - he’s quitting smoking and his body is aching all over, plus he’s not that young (55yo). \n\nAnyway, the event is on Saturday and my dad told my mom that he wants to go Friday night because he’d rather be well rested for the day of the event. My mother agreed - she’ll be there already, she goes tomorrow because she teaches in the University there - so my dad will be driving my sister and my two aunts (mother’s sister and mother’s aunt). Let’s call them Aunt 1 and Aunt 2. \n\nAnd here comes the problem... Aunt 1 (mom’s sister) wants to go Saturday - and around 11o’clock, despite my dad also saying that, if they had to go Saturday, he wanted to leave at 9 am at the latest. Mom still didn’t tell Aunt 1 that they’re actually going Friday night, and since mom travels tomorrow, she’ll likely not tell and leave the issue to my dad. Aunt 1 is struggling with depression (she was on antidepressives until last year, quit taking them for reasons we don’t know and only now resumed taking them) but she’s frankly been a nightmare lately. If anything doesn’t go her way she throws a tantrum and raises her voice and gets kinda mean. Because of that everyone’s afraid of telling her the “we’re going Friday” thing. \n\nI was keeping to myself - I’m not going, so I figured it’s none of my business. But now Aunt 1 is telling Aunt 2 that they’re going Saturday around 11am, which isn’t true at all since nobody told her that - she just assumed that, since that’s when she wants to go, that’s when they’ll go. I want to just tell her the truth already because it’s not fair to my dad, but I’m afraid that this isn’t my place. \n\nWibta if I didn’t wait for my mother and just told Aunt 1 that they are not going Saturday, much less at 11am?

However, the location (a gas station) is somewhere I go daily (and, that I used to work at a couple years ago), so I know that, despite it being a college town, there are quite a few regulars who are... quite old, and might need the spot. Also all conversations are as best as I can remember it. There was more interactions than just this, but for the most part it was repeating the same beats. Capitalized words are raised voices.  \n\n\nI am pulling into the gas station behind another car. The car ahead of me was turning, as the only spot left open by the doors was the handicapped parking space (he would go on to park at a pump, as did I. There were still 3 open when I walked inside). However, he was forced to slam on his brakes as a car zipped in front of him and into the handicapped parking space. It wasn't an illegal move, nor was she speeding through the parking lot... but it was definitely rude.  \n\n\nWhatever. Not a big deal.  \n\n\nI park at a pump and head inside. While I go in, I notice that the rude car didn't have a handicapped plate. I double checked that she had indeed pulled into the handicapped parking space before peeking into the car to see if there was a hanging handicapped sign on the rear-view mirror (my late grandma would use one when she went places with my mom) and also notice that the girl in the car seems to be a peppy young thing couldn't be older than 30, but was probably in her 20s (I'm a 28 yo man, and she looked young to me). I shake my head at this point, disappointed that someone was taking a spot at a semi-busy gas station for a handicapped person, when it seemed there was nothing wrong with her.   \n\n\nI figure it's none of my business and head inside. As I reach for the door, I see \"Deb\" the manager, heading out. I hold the door open for her. We exchanged pleasantries and she went on her way, stating that she was out for the night.  \n\n\nSo, once inside, while I was checking my pockets (I forget my card a lot, so I was making sure I actually had it before I got my purchases). At that point, I felt a pair of spindly arms wrap around me from behind, with painted fingers laced around my chest. The hugger (lets call her Kate, for simplicity) is holding their head against my back. I tense up and state loud enough for the entire store to hear:  \n\n\nME: \"I don't know who you are. Get the fuck off of me.\"  \n\n\nShe complies, stating something about how I should smile more. Because I look like I'm always pissed. (more context: I'm generally seen as a pretty happy guy. I talk jovially with the employees and customers alike. I also have a penchant for having full on conversations with people that I meet at this station). I respond:  \n\n\nME: \"Yeah, normally I get pretty pissed when morons steal handicapped parking spaces.\"  \nKATE: \"Are you a cop?\"  \nME: \"No. I'm just not an asshole.\"  \nKATE: \"So, do you see anyone who needs it, huh?\"  \nME: \"Nope. But that doesn't mean there wont-\"  \nKATE: \"Then whats the problem? There was nowhere else to park!\"  \nME: \"I can see THREE PARKINGS PLACES out ther-!\"  \nKATE: \"THERE'S NOWHERE TO PARK!\" \n\nME: \"THERE ARE PARKING SPACES, if you aren't a BITCH!\"  \n\n\nAt this point, the cashier (let's call her Meg) informs me that if I keep this up, I would be asked to leave. At this point, Kate has a shit-eating grin on her face.  \n\n\nObviously, I decide it's not worth being kicked out of a place where I'm known by a first name basis... so I shut my mouth. I get my items, but in the meantime, I hear Kate talking to Meg. She's clearly talking loud enough so I can hear it from where I'm at.  \n\n\nKATE: \"What do you think about all this?\"  \nMEG: \\*incomprehensible from where I was\\*  \nKATE: \"That guy's such a fucking ASSHOLE.\"  \n\n\nShe brushes past me, with a smug look on her face, after she pays (there was one person in line between us, at this time).  \n\n\nI figure this is all over. Fine. Whatever.  \n\n\nBut then, as I'm paying, I hear something from the doorway, turning to see that Kate was standing in the open door, letting in all the cold air as she berated me:  \n\n\nKATE: \"You fucking asshole!\"  \nKATE: \"I bet you got a tiny dick!\"  \nKATE: \"You fucking dickless asshole!\"  \n\n\nEtc...  \n\n\nI pay for my 52 oz soda and start towards the door. I start to walk towards my car, when I have an idea:  \n\n\nI can either go around the passenger side of her car, or the driver's side. I decide... Driver's side.  \n\n\nME: \"Excuse me, I need to get to my car.\"  \nKATE: \"What?\"  \nME: \"I'm want to get to my car. And there's no other path to get there.\"  \nKATE: \"What's your problem, asshole?\"  \nME: \"Nothing, just that I have to talk to a stupid cunt.\"  \nKATE: \"Oh, yeah, I'm a  cunt. A great big cunt.\"  \nKATE: \"I have a great big vagina that just spills out of my pants  \n*(at this point, Kate is making hand gestures, showing how big her vagina is, and how it flows from her jeans)*  \nME: \"It shows. It REALLY does!\"  \n\n\nI continue to brush past her to get to my car and she leans into me, spilling my soda over both of us, leaving about only half of the soda in the cup, with a crack down one side. At this point, Kate is stunned. She has no words. I continue walking to my car when I hear the guttural yelp of someone desperately throwing something. When the smell of carmel, cream and gas station coffee hits me, I realize that the entire back of my coat is covered in her disgusting half-coffee.  \n\n\nI turn on my heel, half of a soda still in my hands. I consider myself an expert on aiming drinks, mainly due to the fact that I end up with a lot of half-finished drinks, which I tend to toss in an arc, as opposed to making a big puddle. So, I took aim and returned fire, covering the front of her shirt in even more soda than had been spilled before.  \n\n\nSoaking wet (and wanting to prove to her that I'm a better person than her) I threw my empty cup away, got in my car, and tried to leave. She was already on my bumper, fumbling with her phone, trying to record me. I yell for her to get out of my way, as I'm trying to leave. I rev my engine, which makes her back off a little, then use the gap to zip past her and around the other side of the pumps and out the exit of the gas station.  \n\n\nI later learned that she had called the cops on me. That the cops had watched video of the altercation, but nothing else. It's been a week and I have yet to hear from the cops (my plate would have DEFINITELY been on camera, assuming they hadn't moved them since I worked there.), and I was informed by Deb, the manager from before, that none of the cops were told my name. And when I relayed the full story, Deb was trying hard to hold back a laugh.  \n\n\nI later learned that I had distressed Meg with the confrontation in the store, as she wasn't sure how to handle the situation. She was alone at the store, at the time, and both of us (apparently) were regulars. It had apparently caused her to break down a bit, as I was informed that after the incident, Meg was in tears.  \n\n\nSo, I ask: Am I the Asshole?",

The need of human resources is extremely high, so I took the job at a cinema at the checking post as my part time. Note that I work full time at Lotte Mart (a shopping center similar to Walmart) at the receiving dept. My full time job is very time-consuming and exhausting, as we often have containers of goods coming in and out, and there are only 5 staffs in my department, 2 of which only deal with papers and one is our supervisor, which means he rarely gets involved in the receiving process. Me being constantly exhauted is inevitable.\n\nTherefore, when it came to my part time job, I have stated very clearly to my manager that I could only stay for an extra of 15 to 20 minutes at max, partly because I needed rest and partly because my place was about 30 minutes away from the cinema. She was ok with it at first.\n\nBut things didn't go well. She constantly asked me to stay extra time to clean things up, although she has 5 or 6 staffs (who work full time) AND floor janitors to do so. I declined her politely every time, but I always clean up my post spotless before taking my payment and leaving, which also took me 5 to 10 minutes. She wasn't happy with it and insisted that I work overtime or she would pay me nothing. When I asked her if I was going to be paid for my extra time, she said it was my \"contribution to the cinema for being very generous\".

I didn’t get mad because as it wasn’t time to be sleeping I didn’t expect them to walk on eggshells for me.\n\nSo I maybe got ~10 minutes extra.

This was an overnight trip and we stayed there for three days. The trip was pretty fun until the last day. I had missed lunch so, I was upset with myself. I was in the lunch hall and I shoved a chair a bit (keep in mind, I suffer from Bipolar Disorder so my temper can flare up at times, but I’m much better at dealing with it now). I didn’t shove it too hard and I was ready to leave the cafeteria and head off to my next workshop. All of a sudden, this lady with rectangular frame glasses and starts yelling at me. I’ll name her GF (grey fury).\n\nGF: *storms up to me* Hey! You’re making an ass out of yourself! You’re a stupid ass!\n\nSide note: I don’t deal well with being repeatedly followed and confronted because my Bipolar disorder makes me afraid of other people. The best thing for me to do when agitated is to leave and de-escalate things.\n\nMe: This has nothing to do with you. Leave me alone, please!\n\nAt this point, she got even more indignant and followed me around more.\n\nGF: I’m not the one making an ass out of myself! You are! You look absolutely stupid and ridiculous right now!\n\nI had had it. I was so scared, mad, and anxious. I finally stood up for myself.\n\nME: *Yelling, visibly upset* Leave me the hell alone, bitch! What the actual fuck do you not understand about that?!\n\nGF tries to get closer.\n\nME: GO TO HELL, YOU OLD HAG! LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE!\n\nI ran to the bathroom, shut myself in, and cried until my teacher found me. I came out of the bathroom and he asked me what had happened. I told him the whole story and luckily, my teacher is pretty awesome and was totally supportive. He’s like another father to me. He asked me if I knew who she was but, I didn’t. She didn’t work at the convention because she didn’t have a convention name tag, like all employees and attendees were required to wear. I don’t even think she worked at the university.\n\nAfter that, we went to the closing ceremony. After we left the ceremony, I see the crazy woman again. She gives me this dirty look and I flipped her off. Do I regret flipping her off? Hell no. I’m not confrontational and I don’t have a mean bone in my body but the way she treated me was abhorrent. When I got home, I told my parents what happened and they were horrified that an old lady, who was more than old enough to know better, was yelling and cussing at a child with mental problems for no reason.\n\nTLDR: I gently shove chair at convention, crazy old woman cusses me out and follows me, I tell her to go to hell, run away, she follows me around an hour later, and I flip her off.",

We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there’s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn’t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes “oh yeah...” That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don’t want to sound offensive but I’m strictly straight. I’m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would’ve told me a long time ago about it, I would’ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don’t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it’s just not what I’m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don’t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship?

He's pretty rich but also pretty obscure, and wanted to be a politician but lost the only election he ever contested because he's introverted, a bad speaker, and gets easily rattled in debates.\n\nSo, he's kind of projecting his dreams onto his three kids [25F, 23M, and me, 20M]. He has pretty clear roles for each of us:\n\n25F, let's call her Carla: Carla's a former D1.athlete, and currently in the Navy. My dad's train of thought here is that she's extroverted, charismatic, good-looking, and a veteran, so a natural for elected positions. \n\n23M, let's call him Max: Max is in law school and really into debate/public speaking, and is a national-level debater and mock trial attorney. Therefore, my dad wants him in high-profile legal stuff, eventually maybe becoming a judge on an important circuit.\n\nMe: The most like our dad: introverted, not super charismatic, but also assertive and a good organizer/leader. Have been interning on campaigns since I was 16, and am fascinated by the topic of campaigns and marketing in general. Also, I'm studying economics and international relations, and planning to pursue a phd. So, my role's supposed to be basically strategist/manager/policy advisor. \n\nRecently, Carla has been expressing that she doesn't like our plan anymore because she's now apparently a libertarian. One time, this devolved into an argument. I pointed out that both parties had libertarian wings, so it's ridiculous to break with our plan. Don't get me wrong, if she doesn't want to go into politics, that's one thing. But if she's backing out because she's a libertarian, I think that's just stupid, considering that both parties have libertarian wings. \n\nEveryone agreed with my point, except for Carla, who called me an asshole and left. On some level, I'm glad she just considers me an asshole, as opposed to the whole family, since she might listen to them. But I've been wondering, am I?",

It is from around 1960 and although the former owner took care of it, it is ofc in no way up to an usual standard a house should have today. I was very happy about buying our future home and although I wasn't too much looking forward to spend all my time working in the house, I was very positive about the whole situation, as my FIL offered his help. He has helped us before with stuff in our present flat and it always worked out decent.\n\nSo we bought the house and started with the usual...getting rid of the old stuff, ripping of wallpapers etc. And here is when the shit started. FIL and MIL got a key from my SO and started working without one of us being there. Sounds nice? Not for me. They decided about the stuff they did and I absolutly hated that they were doing it without us there. I tried to stop it the nice way like \"Hey, you musn't work here while we are not helping, let's do this later. \" but the did not get it. I asked my SO to make them stop, but he didn't. I told him, that this will lead to problems, but he shrugged it off. Here it is to mention, that he really, *really* adores his parents, they are the highest standard for him in whatever decision, a thinking I myself cannot understand, although Iam close to my father as well.\n\nIt went on...every decision we made was declined as \"impossible\" when it meant to do some more work to do. FIL only wanted to do less than absolutly necessary...e.g. not getting new electricity and so on. He would show me (and just me, as he is sure it is only me who does not want the stuff he tells) every damn socket to prove we do not have to change anything. We still did and his help got less.\n\nBut: Stuff still got worse, but just so lightly, that I can't even explain properly. My SO, who is a (sometime too) lovely and trusting person does not even notice most of the time. FIL just won't listen. Whenever I tell what we planned and have to do he would make it just the other way, driving me nuts.\n\nI know Iam not the most patiently person in the world and due to being very strict oftens many people cannot handle this. I feel sad for my SO having to deal with this, and he straight told me today when I asked him (again) to talk to his father that \"You are forcing me to do stuff I do not want to do.\" while he cannot understand that his parents are in my opinion incredible rude and even when they try to be helpful it is not helful in any way when we can never be sure if something will be made as we wish. And if I say \"we\" it is mostly me, as he will believe every damn word his father says, even if there is proof that it is as wrong as it can be.\n\nI told him to talk to his parents again. I cannot stand this anymore, Iam handling far more than I can, working a fulltime job and doing every single thing by myself, as I know that otherwise it will be done in a different way as wished. Additionally my SO has not the slightest idea how to renovate a house (neither have I, but Iam learning and reading stuff every night for many month by now) and he really sucks at crafting. Due to the high pressure Iam even less patient and we fight a lot, what is pretty uncommon for us. It sucks and I fucking hate it and the whole situation and I know that my bad mood is most responsible for our fights. I told him today again, that we need the help, that I would really appreciate his fathers help, but only if he does it as we wish with no exceptions. My SO does not want to do this. It might sound trivial, but the conflict in the whole situation is really strong and Iam even afraid for our future. So know Iam asking myself...\n\nAITA?",

We had a good relationship and moved into an apartment together the next year because we didnt have on campus housing. Things were great, we were good friends and spent most of our time watching tv together cause neither of us went out much. \n\nDuring the end of our junior year I got a boyfriend while on spring break.

Once I returned from spring break I didn't have any desire to tell my roommate about this bf because in the past when i had opened up about relationships she was super judgmental to the point where I was upset the things she said.

I didn't have the mental energy to deal with her as it was the least of my worries at the time.\n\nShe eventually got more frustrated to my face and would stop cleaning, told me not to use her groceries which we had always shared including things like salt.

No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something.

One guy \\[\\~20\\] in the discord has been having some \"financial issues\" and has know my girlfriend for about half a year. Around August of LAST YEAR he asked her for money to buy some souvenirs at some PAX convention because he didn't have any money left over from his airfare/hotel. Being the incredibly nice person my girlfriend is, she gave him about $250 for a total. It turns out that within a week he's purchased some new video games. Suspicious, me and a couple friends figured he just used the money she gave him to buy them. He claimed he gets \"grants\" from his school that average around $2000 or something and he would pay her back yet come September. He then asked her for another $250 to buy a Razer mouse and keyboard that was \"on sale\" and could get it cheap and that he would pay her back. Again, being the nice person my girlfriend is, she gave him the money. Welllll come September and he says he needs until October. Alright...getting suspicious again, but I try to stay out of it because I hate internet/Discord drama. So he then gets back to her around the end of October/early November and pays her HALF claiming he would \"give her the rest plus interest.\" Unsurprisingly, he asks for another $250 for reasons my girlfriend won't tell me because I've expressed serious anger about it before. He then tells her sometime December that \"plans have changed\" and he's going to be joining up with the US military, whatever the hell that has to do with anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's now late February THIS YEAR and he has yet to pay her back. It came up again in a conversation with her and in a blind rage I went on to Discord and messaged him saying stuff like \"you're a pathetic adult,\" \"stop leeching off girls you've never met,\" and \"if you need financial help get it in real life not Discord strangers.\" He replied obviously angry saying stuff like \"You're so tough behind a screen\" and \"You don't know the full story so shut the fuck up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I don't know the full story and frankly I don't care but if you need help you shouldn't be leeching off of someone you've never met to purchase expensive and unnecessary stuff and claiming to pay them back. Someone like him has no right to ask for MORE MONEY claiming to pay them back after already $500 in debt to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Girlfriend is now pissed at me because she got angry texts from him saying things like \"Keep your boyfriend in check\" and \"I don't need his shit when he doesn't know anything about it.\" She is in school and said she doesn't want anymore drama. Should I have just stayed out of it or was I in the right to get involved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Guy asks for $700 from my girlfriend and says he will pay her back but hasn't in in about 6 months, got pissed off any messaged him on Discord.

So technically now this opened up two spots that were directly connected and I could have pulled through my intended spot and gone right into the spot in front of it so another car which had come up behind me could take my original spot. The problem with this however, is that I planned to make some large purchases, buying an appliance and small piece of furniture. If I had pulled through, this guy would have snugged right up behind me and when I came back out I wouldn’t be able to open my back hatch/gate and load my items. So I stopped in my intended spot and parked. This guy was furious, laid on his horn and rolled his window down to berate me. I simply replied that I needed to be able to load large items in my car and this was going to be a big shop. I couldn’t have my back end blocked. He was so mad. His wife flipped me the bird and they sped off like crazy people in a parking lot with pedestrians everywhere. \n\nI guess I could have pulled right through and out into the next aisle, done like a 5 point turn and reparked in my required direction, but the lot was so crowded and I probably would have just confused another car in the next aisle while doing an Austin powers technique getting my car turned around.

She brings up the idea that places are haunted or that astrology has any actual bearing on our actual lives and most of the time I’m willing to just smile and nod and let her go on thinking whatever she wants about that kind of stuff, but it actually makes me really angry when she tries to explain real life circumstances using astrology for example \n\nX can’t get along with Y because he’s a whatever sign and he’s a whatever sign and so that means they are incompatible \n\nI think this is the biggest load of bullshit and extremely counterproductive to people actually understanding each other. Rather than fabricating a reason why they can’t get along why not try to find common ground and common understanding. Wouldn’t that be 10x better than ascribing some special meaning to the way the stars and planets align on any given night? \n\nAnother example of my supposed close mindedness is my refusal to believe in ghosts. I’m an avid horror movie enthusiast and love a good possession story but I know it’s all fake! When you die you get pumped full of chemicals and buried in a guilted box or you get cremated and have your ashes spread and you are gone. That may be an uncomfortable concept to some but gone is gone. My fiancé claims her friend Beverly who passed away when she was young is still around and looking out for her, while I would never ever ever attack this belief as she is and always has been very sensitive about the matter but she believes my refusal to acknowledge the existence of spirits is a direct insult to her friends memory. \n\nAll of this was brought to a head the other day resulting in a brief fight followed by a long awkward car ride. It all started with a conversation about ouija boards. She said she would be upset if I ever brought one into the house, given her beliefs I understand that but i think it’s genuinely silly to be scared of an inanimate object. The fact that this specific object is seen as a bridge of sorts doesn’t really change my view of it. Come on it’s a freakin board with letters and numbers. Sure it’s a fun party game but there’s always some asshole guiding the selector thing. Following me saying this we discussed both of the aforementioned situations and this resulted in her telling me I was being closed minded and inconsiderate of what she believes. I said it’s healthy to be skeptical of things that are seemingly incorrect. (this may have been where I fucked up) \n\nWas I so quick to dismiss her beliefs that I hurt her feelings over it? Is she being overly sensitive? I honestly feel like it’s a really stupid thing to fight over because the answer is so fucking obvious but I guess if you are brought up believing in that kind of stuff then it might be hard to shake later in life.

She is currently about 8 months pregnant. She has gestational diabetes, so she is forced to eat a diabetic diet and check her blood sugars.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, she has been on and off about eating healthy and checking her sugars. She was very busy with work and school during the first trimester, so she primarily ate fast food between classes, etc and didn't check her sugar. I didn't really find out about her diet until later on when she said she was too busy/stressed to eat healthy.\n\nI try to do everything I can to help and be supportive. I almost always have a diabetic-friendly dinner made for when she gets home and lunches packed for her. If she is out running errands and hungry, I tell her to text me before she gets home and I'll make sure there's healthy food ready for her. I also do the majority of our cleaning to keep her from being stressed. In my mind, we're in the pregnancy together, and I want to do everything I can to help keep her and our baby healthy.\n\nFor awhile, she was rarely taking her blood sugar. She was busy, stressed, and I think the pregnancy emotions were making things very difficult. After eating fast food (5 months pregnant), she came back home and I told her she really needs to take her blood sugar. She was annoyed, but took it to basically appease me. It was almost 300. For those unaware, those are dangerous levels. She took that as a reality check and started to manage her gestational diabetes better.\n\nShe finished school around 6 months. For the next couple months, AFAIK, she was doing better. The other day (8 months pregnant), she came home with fast food. I asked her why she didn't message me to make her food—she said she didn't think about it. I don't expect her to be perfect, so I just asked her to please take her blood sugar in an hour so we can manage it through exercise or whatever if necessary.\n\nAn hour passes by, I remind her, ask her if she wants me to get her supplies for her, etc. She said no she'll get it. Another 20 minutes passes, she said she is busy scheduling appointments. I told her I would literally bring it right to her since blood sugar is time-sensitive, and that her health is more important, but she needs to take it. She throws her papers in the air, yells that I'm annoying and nagging, and storms out of the house.\n\nI can see how it can be perceived as nagging, but it's not only her health, it's also our daughter's. It's frustrating because I'm completely reliant on her actions—all I can do is try to make sure we have healthy food available and ready. We had a rough last pregnancy (ended up fine and healthy). So far through her appointments, everything has looked okay, but I'm still nervous about the birth.\n\nAm I nagging? Should I just let her do her thing and not worry so much? Or is she out of line getting pissed at me?",

She has set up her own account and is keeping her money there where I can't see it, and doesn't think it's reasonable for me to want it in the joint account. My thinking is that with this extra income in the monthly budget, we can pay off our debts faster, or save up for a holiday etc but we should make the decision together. She wants to save it herself in a separate account so she can see the fruits of her labor (my wording). She says she won't be selfish with it but needs it to feel better about working and missing out on seeing the kids etc. \n\nAnyway I don't really know how other couples with families combine or separate their finances, so thought I'd see what Reddit thinks.

He is not my mother’s child, only my father’s. His real mother is a deadbeat. However if he came out I am certain my father would come around to it, only because over the years he’s gradually distanced himself from our old church because of how hateful the pastors’ associates have become toward gay people. It’s not an endorsement of their lifestyle, but it is a refusal to despise them. However he still thinks he has the right to deny baking a cake for them. \n\nI disagree with my father and my parents’ conservativeness, but have yet to vocalize said disagreements. I merely keep a safe distance since I’m in college. My brother however still tries to please them because I think he is conflicted. He still has Christian ideals and prays but his friends don’t share the same values (a lot of them are off the books weed/coke  dealers). He’s a bit of an alcoholic because of the fights he got into with our controlling parents growing up and I wouldn’t call him a deadbeat because he’s a very skilled manager at a retail store and did graduate college buuut all his free time is spent partying and abusing drugs as he tries to support his friends’ rap career (he’s apart of their group and frankly they suck. I wouldn’t disparage them if they didn’t pretend to be better than they are or ridicule me for being book smart, but the only person in their group that has a shot at making it is their producer because he can make beats in the style of many other producers. Lyrically speaking they need some help.)\n\nMy brother is a pretty macho fella. I am not. I do like sports, i play with my friends, but i don’t have as much muscle mass as him despite being toned/muscular myself. He used to bully me because he was treated as the problem child by my parents growing up but that all changed when i played sports in high school. I wouldn’t call him “nice,” but i would say he became invested in my athletic career and gave me helpful pointers, but it was primarily to preserve his reputation at our high school/college. His athletic career was the only way he could gain favor with my dad who served in the military. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier his friends are into drug abuse. He is heavily invested in a thuggish image that he maintains on his private instagram. He used to constantly pick on me for being a square and doing well in high school and college. I don’t resent him as much because I understand where he’s coming from and I’ve secretly been going to therapy for the last year to feel better about myself. I wouldn’t say I am at 100%, but I am far more confident than I used to be. Occasionally though i will be reminded of something he did and it’ll fuck up my whole day. (nitpicking my athletic performance in front of others, calling me gay as a kid cause I was into opera and Sailor Moon, criticizing me in front of our veteran of a dad when i wore brighter colors, belittling my interest in theater, etc.) One day he called me crying while drunk and apologized for being an asshole, but he hasn’t really changed much. He’ll still occasionally call me pansy or queer, despite my protests. I only know about him being gay because he opened up to me while under the influence, and told me “to never mention it again” when he sobered up. One of his friends mentioned it in front of me and he was pissed. \n\nAnyhoo, I attended a Christmas Eve family event and brought two friends. Word got around that I made the honor roll. He scoffed and rolled his eyes. My mother made a smart ass remark at my brothers’ expense. She said she meant it as a joke but it pissed him off. He glared at her and walked out. He returned a couple of hours later and talked to her privately, but he was drunk as fuck. I could tell by his staggering. She urged him to drink some water and sober up and he initially listened but couldn’t resist the call of my cousins playing basketball in the driveway. \n\nHe began to show off in front of my younger cousins. He was sloppy and unnecessarily aggressive. My cousins are 14, 16, and 17. I was already outside with my friends watching and we decided to go to one of their houses. My brother continuously taunted me as I left and threw the basketball at my head. I gave him the bird as I was slowly losing my cool then he continued to taunt me “cone here pussy, come play with me ya little queer” etc etc and I lost it. “Youre the only real queer around here.” He came at me but I ran away and all my friends and cousins subdued him. He cursed me as I got into my car and my dad and all the dudes came outside to find out what happened. He brushed it off and walked away. I haven’t talked to him since and he didn’t show up for Christmas breakfast. \n\nI really hate that I outted him but there’s a part of me that feels good about it. I finally hurt him. But I outted him in front of my cousins who I’m certain relayed the info to my uncle and father. Dads been pretty stern all morning. \n\nAITA? Could there have been a better way to go around this? He just makes me feel so weak and he’s projected his weakness and “”effiminacy”” on to me for so fucking long and it felt good to hurt him back. I just hate that it was at an inconvenient time for him and could mar his already shit relationship with our parents. Being closeted is more-so about survival than anything else and i feel like shit\n\nTLDR; My closeted bully of an older brother got mad at me at Christmas Eve dinner bc my mom showed off my academic success at his expense.

When I’m in a better mental state my bedroom tends to be neat but when I’m feeling depressed it kinda goes to shit. I’ve tried to keep it clean but my motivation to do so always just kinda vanishes after awhile. My parents HATE this. They will undermine everything I’ve ever accomplished if my room isn’t clean. For example, I just got a part time job teaching private voice and piano, something that is very difficult to do without a degree of some kind. I told my parents and they didn’t care at all because my laundry wasn’t done. They’ll also take any fight my mom and I have and spin it back on me because my room isn’t clean, even if it has nothing to do with that. For example, my mom one time saw me wearing a bikini, poked my stomach and said \n\n“Mmmm Pasta?”\n\nMind you I’m very self conscious about my weight and struggled with bulimia for awhile. I stormed out of the house and went crying to the beach only to get a text ten minutes later “Well maybe if your room was clean...”\n\nWell the other day I was fighting with my mom (again) because I said I was looking into apartments. I had told her I want to move in with a friend because I think not living together would help our relationship more and give me the space I need.

For the first few months, they’ve been good with not scheduling me on those days but it’s not until recently that they’ve started to screw me over. \n\nI decided to take more classes this semester so I can transfer quicker, but because of this I requested a third day off so I can focus on my education. I didn’t give a specific day of the week; I just needed more time to deal with a larger workload.

Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.",

I just tried to get as much information out as possible for the fairest verdict.\n\nWhile we were going through the process of putting our  house up for sale, some friends wanted to rent it. We talked about it for a bit, and decided to offer to let them rent the house off of us for just the mortgage price -- without us making any money from the deal.\n\nOne thing led to another and the friends ended up moving in early. We're still not due to move until the summer, but they moved in back in January. We agreed to let them, and only charged rent -- no utilities since we have decent jobs, trying to be nice,\n\nThroughout their staying here (at the time of this writing it's been a little over two months), one came to us asking if she could get a dog. We own three dogs ourselves, so we really didn't see the harm. My wife and I have 3 medium-sized dogs so it was surprising when she got a very large Husky.\n\nThis dog is huge. The door to her room is now scratched all-to-pieces where the dog wants to be out. The dog also destroyed the backyard and the screen on our back window. I will admit that some of it was probably from my dogs as well. They're not entirely innocent.\n\nMy other friend felt as if she was incredibly lonely. Not having a pet, she requested if she could get an animal. She wanted a cat and we declined because my wife is allergic to cats. After a while of discussion she ended up talking us into it. Honestly, my wife and I are pushovers.\n\nI work from home. Saying that, I'm home a huge portion of the day. Our friends are at college or just out hanging out with their other friends until 11:30-12. So, everyday we sit at home all day having to hear the cat's cry all day nonstop. Neither of us can show it attention seeing as how she's allergic and I would have to scrub down/change clothes anytime I came in contact with it.\n\nHusky friend has also had her boyfriend staying here for the entire month. He doesn't really do anything. He's just living here using up the utilities that my wife and I are paying for. Initially when it was brought to my attention that he was coming, it was for the weekend. I feel like this is slightly unfair to my wife and myself since we're having to spend even more money on utilities.\n\nMy wife and I are still the ones buying the toiletries, dish soap, laundry detergent, pretty much any consumable used in the house. They do buy their own food but I'm stuck doing their dishes and cleaning up after them in the kitchen. I can't say they dirty up the communal areas much. Their rooms are absolutely disgusting and  foul-odors are coming from them.\n\nTL;DR: My friends moved in, got a dog and a cat. Dog tears things up and cat constantly meows to the point my wife and I are staying insanely stressed. Recently discovered wife is pregnant so the stress is extra not good.\n\nI really want a fair outside opinion.",

I commute to my school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. We always _at least_ text each other a “happy birthday” each year. \n\nThis year, I went around the house collecting some baby pictures of her and I (and two of them included our older brother). I then made a collage of them and made a post to her on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday. \n\n\n So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”\n\nHer response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”\n\nI’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. \n\nMe: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”\n\nH: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.”\n\nMe: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.”\n\nH: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.”\n\nMe: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.”\n\nHer: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”\n\nMe: “ I’m mentioning it a week later because I was hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually. But yeah sorry for being unfair I guess and it is late, I’ll go to bed.”\n\nHer: “Whatever.”\n\nSo AITA here?",

A few weeks ago I had this idea to basically create starter pack memes of each of my friends poking fun at all the quirky and small things they do or have done. This went really well for the first few of my friends as I quickly slopped together some Google images and pasted them in mspaint. \n\nHowever, we have this one friend, we'll call him T, who is generally kind of recognized as the pretentious friend of the group. As I worked my way through each of my friend's memes, T takes notice and asks for a starter pack of himself. I tell him that he'll have to wait until I get through some of the other people's before I started working on his. He obliges initially for a little while, but then he begins to become a little more persistent while also requesting that I pull no punches on his, making sure to really \"push his shit in.\" His words, not mine. Anyway, I finish up and begin working on his  starter pack when he says that anything relating to him \"acting smarter than he actually is\" is low effort and unoriginal.\n\nHere's the thing about T. I mentioned that he was the \"pretentious\" friend, but in general he's a pretty good guy. However, sometimes, he gets too big for his britches and I feel like I need to knock him down a few pegs, so hearing that I should pull no punches on his starter pack, I went all out on him. Over the next couple of days, I made a giant collage of all the weird and strange things he tends to do, but also went after all of his deepest insecurities in making his starter pack as he had requested.\n\nAfter it was all done, I immediately thought that perhaps I had gone a little too far. However, persistent as he is, T demanded that I post it. I really hesitated posting it, even going so far as to make him sign a \"consent form\" for what he was about to see. I upload the image and immediately T shits on it, calling it unoriginal, low effort, disappointing, and 0/10. I felt a little bad as I had worked on this for a few days only for it to be put down, but whatever.\n\nHowever, things got weird from here. Following this, T completely and suddenly disappears off discord and cuts all communications with the friend group for the next two weeks, deleting his discord account one week in. Rightfully so, the whole group starts to get increasing worried about his whereabouts as we try to contact him to no avail. A few hours ago, though, one of my other friends broke through to him to ask what happened to him, only to learn that he left because of the image that I had posted.\n\nAm I the asshole? Did I go too far in trying to roast him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I only have one issue with my bf, and it's that everytime he compliments me, he calls me \"hot\".\n\nI know that this is a really stupid thing to bother me but I got 2 reasons why I dislike it. The first being that I think it is a sort-of objectifying term, and it makes me think that my body is the most important thing to him. I would much rather him call me \"pretty\", \"beautiful\", or \"cute\" because I think those compliments take my personality into consideration. I feel kind of uncomfortable if he sees my sex appeal as my defining trait. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the thought behind the compliment and I find him really attractive too so I try to compliment his looks aswell. But the term \"hot\" seems to only focus on my body and sex appeal, and not to sound like a stereotype but I want our relationship to be deeper than that. (Another important note here is that me and my bf haven't had sex yet)\n\nThe other reason I don't like him calling me hot is because my ex used to use that term constantly to describe me. My ex coerced me into sex on two occasions before I found out he actually had a girlfriend who he was cheating on her with me. He used to get me incredibly drunk and then take advantage of me in some way, thankfully we only dated for a month. I never really realized it was an abusive relationship because he seemed so loving towards me, he constantly called me \"hot\". I remember specifically he would say \"you're so hot you're making me so hard right now\" to hint that I should give him a bj. I was 18 at the time and really wanted to save having my first time with a guy I knew really well and I wanted the relationship to be deeper than sex. Anyway the word \"hot\" was his go-to compliment and that's why it triggers me a little lmao.\n\nAnyway so I've been planning the next time my bf calls me \"hot\" to explain my reasons to him and ask him to use another word. I'm afraid it's gonna sound like I'm picky or ungrateful? I'm sorry if this is too small of an issue for this subreddit btw",

I work as a shift manager whilst my SO works as a cleaner for a small business. Since she works as a cleaner, I mainly assumed that SHE would do most, if not all of the cleaning. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not sexist! It’s just because she’s good at it, not because she’s a woman.\n\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, the house starts getting worse, as though she has stopped cleaning. Normally, my partner will put my work clothes through the wash and dry, iron and fold them on my dresser so that I can just get up at 8am to leave for work easily. The first time it happened, my clothes were left on the floor, unwashed and not ironed. I was pissed, but I put them on and went to work (th whole time I felt self conscious and embarrassed). I felt humiliated so I came home and waited for her to finish work. We argued and she said she was sick of having to do all of the cleaning and washing. I tell her it’s been like this since we moved in and that she was being an asshole about it, especially by randomly not washing my clothes, making me feel shitty the whole day. It ended with her crying and bolting the bathroom door shut. I had to stay up for a few hours to calm her down.\n\n\nEver since, I’ve had to start cleaning shit up and im beginning to get mad that she won’t tidy shit up anymore. She’s GOOD at it, and even earned a raise for how well clients were rating her service. It pissed me off that she expected me to now do all my own laundry and wash my plate after she cooked. I’ve never been good at it, and my mom always scolded the fact I could never clean up as well as her.\n\n\nI posted this finally because I’m debating bringing this up with her. It’s inconsiderate of her to leave everything to me after I’ve been at work all day. I may even mention that if she carries on, I will move back to my moms house so that I can be relaxed after a really long day at work.i don’t think that I’m an asshole and my mom agreed she should be doing more than she is right now.\n\nAITA??\n",

Back in October, the two of us (person I want to ask) were good friends, nothing to think too hard about. One of my close friends told me I should \"focus on her,\" since we're both encouraging friends. And so things stared going smoothly for the first few months. But both her and I became busy with school, and as college applications + side projects subtly piled up, we gradually kinda stopped talking to each other. Not entirely, but we used to talk everyday not that long ago... I'll just say there is definitely some awkward wall between us, not sure how else to explain this\n\nI know I've been irresponsible as a friend and all that stuff, so I've been trying my best to patch things up with her in February/March. My initial problem was that I wasn't sure if she would want to go with me, since things had gone kinda out of hand.\n\nBut the real problem happened this week on a hiking trip with friends. The same close friend casually asked me if I wanted to go to prom. Now, literally back in early February, the two of us were talking about potential prom dates at a birthday party. We had both told each other who we wanted to ask, and at the time they were obviously different people. Let's call my \"date\" person A and my close friend's date person B. \n\nDuring our hiking hangout(about two months after the birthday party), my close friend tells me person B has a boyfriend, and that he wanted to ask person A. I couldn't get myself to say anything to his face right then and there, but I have texted him over this. He gave a couple of inconsiderate excuses, and now, despite asking again to have a calm discussion over this, he's been ghosting me :/\n\nNow a third friend told me that my close friend had told him that \"oh, I think OP and person A havent talked in forever.\" This is true to some extent, and I feel godawful about it because it is lowkey true. although I can't do much over being busy and stressed over college.\n\nMy close friend has told me that he assumed I moved on from person A, which I just find really frustrating. I would have told him if \"things weren't going well,\" since we were friends and all, but I guess not. I'm not really sure what to do, it seems like he is going to ask her without really confronting me about it first (kind of a scumbag move, but rn whats more important is the end result)\n\nFirst of all, AITA?\n\nSecond, would it be reasonable to ask my close friend to all go together as a group of friends, but neither of ask person A?

She decided yeah, she should get an abortion. I tried to make sure it was HER decision and not his, since she'd been into it before she talked to him. She said stuff about not wanting to raise a child as a single parent (I'm a single mom, so that stung, but it's not my life) and planned on going through with it. Sadly, she ended up miscarrying. She was upset but, I think, somewhat relieved. Life went on. About a year later, she met another guy who was also Bad News, in and out of drug rehab and halfway houses, definitely not relationship material, but she jumped right in with him and quickly got pregnant. This time, she admitted she wanted to get pregnant, planned it, and wanted to keep the baby. She was even more excited, we were talking baby showers, she wanted me at the birth, we talked names, she was ordering personalized onesies to break the news to her parents. I was still in another state, but I was there for her every way I could be during those weeks. She went to the doctor and sent me an ultrasound photo, and I cried and fell even more in love with this little blob. But then... her Bad News guy had to go back to rehab. He was having a lot of mental health issues, including dissociative identity disorder, bipolar, and others. It became clear that he was not fully able to be in a relationship with her because of his issues with drugs and mental health. Once he went back to rehab and my friend realized she was alone, she decided she wanted to get an abortion. This time, I was shocked. She was excited, she loved the baby, she wanted the baby, she planned for this. She got me involved, excited, and in love with this baby then so suddenly changed her mind. We didn't talk much about it. She told me after she had the procedure, and I checked in to make sure she was okay. It's been about a year and we are still close friends but we don't talk about it.

I began to turn into a curmudgeon because I just can’t get a solid night’s rest.\n\n I suggest she needs to sleep outside of the bedroom.

He just kind of laughs and goes “she’s a cat”. My logic is “sure, she’s a cat but she also needs to be trained.” \n\nThis leads me to do a bit of scholarly internet research about training cats.

I even tell him that she can’t sleep in the bed with baby around so she needs to be broken of the habit NOW before baby comes so she won’t blame him for her eviction.

I've never understood how anyone can enjoy it, having limited holidays per year, having to show up to a location or work remotely every day without fail. I remember as a child asking my dad when his summer holidays were and being confused/horrified that he didn't get any.\n\nThe funny thing is, I actually have a job I really enjoy.\n\nI'll get the part out of the way that I'm sure most people will call my an asshole for. I live in a country with strong labour laws, I have (for employment) very good annual leave/sick leave compared to the rest of the world. I have a job for a company that I believe is helping the world, I get a good wage and only have to work 40 hours a week. I enjoy what I do, I'm good at what I do, always get praise from management. My team is awesome and I'm good friends with a few of them, no working drama. Pretty sweet right?\n\nWell every day I still feel absolute dread that I have to wake up to an alarm. Realising that I'll be doing this for decades to come is horrifying to me. I've more than once thought about just killing myself to avoid it, not because I'm depressed, I'm not at all. We work so much of our lives and get so little time off in comparison. If I'm sick, or want to take a holiday, I have to inform my work, if I don't I get fired. If I quit my job I lose my house as I can't pay the mortgage. It doesn't help that I feel like I could do my weeks worth of work in about two days but I have to come in every day or I get fired (I have asked my manager for work from home days, that's really a no go and most jobs don't allow it, I've looked extensively). \n\nI legitimately stayed at University for three years longer than I should have just to get the four months off at the end of the year, I used to work multiple jobs during the year to save up enough so I wouldn't have to work over the four months off. That's pretty much impossible to do with a full time job, nobody wants someone who'll work less than 10 months a year.\n\nWhenever I share even the softest version of my view with people they freak the fuck out, talk about how I owe everything to the job, how I need to be a team player and just do it. When I tell people I'm strictly 9-5 and don't check emails or take calls out of hours they also freak out and tell me I'm letting my employer down. I keep this stuff to myself now.\n\nI wish I could be doing anything else. When I have time off I read books, go for walks, go for runs, try new hobbies, watch movies, do volunteer work (not forced to do so I enjoy it significantly more). \n\nSo, am I a huge asshole for hating the whole idea/structure of work?",

Animals are a lot of work and a lot of money to take care of between the food, the litter, (for cats which is what we have) replacing the litter boxes every so often, etc... Well when we first got together she had 2 cats. Fine and dandy, 2 is manageable and I like cats so no big deal. Well after picking up a few strays along the way, and not having the money to get them fixed when we should have (don't start about that, I get it, bad cat owners. Remember what I said about them being expensive?) we eventually topped off at 6 permanent cats with litters of kittens that we got rid of along the way. It hasn't been easy and its caused a lot of stress between us and to us personally but we made it through. Last year we lost two of our cats due to health complications (we got them to the vet, they were sick with feline leukemia and we had to have them euthanized for different reasons between the two of them). It was very hard on both of us but we were back down to a manageable, albeit not ideal, 4 cats. Well guess what? The only female kitten we have got pregnant again and had a litter of 5 kitten, we still have all 5 6 months later with no end in sight. Oh, and guess what? She's pregnant again and about to burst. Our last male cat has an appointment to be fixed this month and I told her outright that if he doesnt get fixed, and the kittens that are 6 months old aren't gone by the end of the month, I'm leaving. \n\nNow let me explain why, besides the ridiculous amount of stress it puts on me since I'm currently staying home and have to clean up after 9 cats, and stay up all night to make sure the kittens don't end up pregnant. When our pregnant cat has kittens again, I can see her current kittens causing issues for the new litter. The current litter likes to try to be around mom, obviously, but the mom doesnt like it, I guess because she's pregnant again. So I can see that being a problem when mom is with her new litter. I also am fearful for the health of not only our cats, but the 6-month old litter. Feline leukemia is contagious and we aren't yet sure which of our cats, if any more, have it. The longer this litter is around our cats, the more susceptible they are to the disease. Also the 6-month old litter is causing a lot of stress to our current cats, cause we simply dont have room for 9 cats plus ANOTHER litter right now. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope. She won't meet me halfway when it comes to getting rid of them. The animal shelter is very expensive to surrender them to ($100 per kitten) amd she doesnt want to post them online because she wants to make sure they go to a good home, which I understand but look what that's costing us. I left home almost a week ago to get a break from all the cats and if it were up to me I wouldnt go back, but I wanted to make it clear to her that I absolutely would be leaving again for good if the kittens weren't gone by the end of the month and our last male cat wasn't fixed.

I'm in shock at this point, and feel kind of messed up, because this is something I don't deal well with, my mother didn't know what the word privacy was, and had a very large tendency to just barge in unannounced without saying a word. So I felt a bit triggered and started yelling at him that I didn't appreciate him just barging into my house. I did not use any profanity. His reaction was to twist the situation around and scold me for scolding him on this matter. Eventually I was appalled and I took his rambling with disdain , my cousin had the audacity to tell me to 'don't blow a fuse' when he barges into my house, like Kramer from Seinfeld, and then scold me for not inviting him in, while i'm in my underwear, and my gf is hiding in the bedroom. After I told him to leave, he still won't talk to me till this date, (not that I actually care, but I guess it's a thing now) but now my  family thinks i'm an asshole because I wasn't hospitable enough for him. AITA for not wanting my cousin randomly in my house? \n",

I am 6ft5 and get a little bit anxious when I feel like I'm in a confined space, not panic attack bad but I find it difficult to relax and my stomach goes a bit mad. My stop is the first stop so the bus is empty, and most of the seats are difficult to fit my legs behind. As a result I have a really uncomfortable journey. That is unless I get one of the seats on the top deck of the bus at the front, where there is legroom a plenty. It's the only seat I can comfortably sit in. \n\nThe bus stop is pretty busy and most people want this seat, however the vast majority of people are significantly shorter than me, and I am always the tallest person there. So when the bus pulls up I will weave between people to get round them and get that seat. My reasoning is that they will suffer little to no discomfort from sitting in the seats with less legroom. To clarify this isn't a queue where you are rewarded for being early, it's a bit of a free for all and you're rewarded for guessing where the doors stop. The unwritten rule is that if you guess right you are rewarded by getting to go on the bus first, generally people don't push past each other once on the bus has stopped. I however flout this rule believing my need for the leg room seat to be greater. \n\nI mentioned this to a friend and she said 'ahh tall white male assumes he's entitled to the best seat on the bus, typical'. She was joking but it got me thinking, should I actually be doing this or am I being a selfish asshole. \n\nA few clarifications: \n\nI do not use my size to physically push past people, for a tall lad I'm quite nimble it's more of a weave. \n\nThe queue system is respected generally once the bus has stopped\n\nIf it was a traditional queuing system I would go early, let a bus go by and make sure I was first in line for the next bus. \n\n**TL;DR: Am I (a tall man) the asshole for weaving past people to get a better leg room seat?**",

This past week was one of those times, she has worked out of town for 2 weeks although she did pop in the previous weekend so we could attend a friend's wedding and have dinner/beers with the rest of my friends group who are usually out of town (they live all over now).\n\nFast forward to this weekend, I was invited Thursday night to this bbq that was happening at a new friend's house on Saturday afternoon. A little bit of backstory here, I was one for the few friends that stuck around in my hometown after high school (I'm 27) and I haven't gotten around to making new friends to hang out with so I appreciate any opportunity to make more. While this is happening, my gf let's me know she's coming in on Saturday, I tell her I can't pick her up since I was working that Saturday and she says it's fine, her dad can get her home and immediately after that, I invite her to said bbq because I was sensing this was gonna cause me issues and she just said she would consider but didn't think so.\n\nThen, on Saturday, my friend was getting ready for the cookout and told me to be there by around 3 PM. I go and then my gf texts me, asking what am I doing and around what time are we gonna see each other, I tell her I am at the bbq and if we could meet at 8 PM. No answer after my texts and I call her, she says she thinks she always loses to my friends (like I said, I don't have any) and that she was really excited to see me after being a whole week away, going off about how we barely got to see each other the previous weekend because we had to attend the wedding and  then go to dinner with my friends and how she feels if it came between her and my friends, I would've gone with then and if she hadn't gone to the dinner get together she wouldn't have seen me at all as I would've gone to dinner anyway (which is true, I never get to see this friend group so I take advantage of any opportunity).\n\nSo, while on the call (this took place around 5 pm), I try and defend myself, \"it's not true\", \"we can see each other in a bit, like I said, 8 pm\" but she was having none of it and repeating how she always loses to my friends, then says she has to go and we hang up. For what it's worth, we don't see each other for the rest of the day and after texting her a bit to angry responses and her telling me the day was off and we could see each other some other time, so I decide to salvage the day, stay and get wasted l, though that didn't stop me texting her.\n\nThe next day, I try and talk to her and she's making one word responses, so I notice she's punishing me, I insist and we meet up at the time she said. I get there, we go to the mall, get a coffee, I walk with her as she pays her bills, she's still mad but it's a start.\n\nAfter that, we get to her house, I say hi to her family and we talk. In short, she thinks I could do so much more, that she's not a priority to me, that my friends, or my recent acquaintances at that party, would obviously blow it off for their respective wives and gfs. I try to tell her that they're not in the same position and not desperate to get new friends like I am but I recognize it's a flimsy defense and I drop it, only telling her that I was super sorry. A little bit later, I go gone and she tells me again over WhatsApp, then blocks me. This has worried me a great deal so I feel forced to ask about another POV.\n\nSo, in short, AITA? Could I have done better? Is it just a TIFU? I feel I'm not completely in the wrong but I have no idea.\n\n\n\n\n",

My parents raised my sister and they had very different conflicting parenting styles (they are now divorced which seemed to stem from my sister's problems) which essentially resulted in her never getting diciplined for anything ever. The results have been a 7th grader who has about 2 full blown temper tantrums per day, bullies her peers, ignores (literially pretends she doesn't hear) anything she disagrees with, is completely self centered and doesn't try to hide it, and is very materialistic. No one in my family wants to be around her, even my parents. \n\nSome examples of her behavior: she tried to stab me twice growing up, my brother once, and my mom once. She kicks my cat to get to me. She will ask my mom to buy her things everywhere she goes and when my mom says no she will have full blown tempertantrums in the middle of the store. She says that she hates everyone behind their back (my dad's girlfriend, my mom, my boyfriend, my brother) just for attention. She looks under the tree at christmas and sees that she has one less present than the rest of us and then throws a fit because of it, etc. My mom started drinking heavily at least in part because of her, and my dad was borderline emotionally abusive to me to take out his frustration for over three years. \n\nToday we celebrated christmas at my mom's house, and a large chunk was tainted because of her behavior. My boyfriend, brother, and I are all back home from school for the break and wanted to spend time with my mom but she turned it very negative. It's my mom's first christmas after a divorce and she has no one to spend it with, and my sister didn't even care about how selfish she was being. Once we got home I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend being sad because of how it turned out, and my dad saw me and wanted to get me to talk about it. We talked for a second, just mentioned that my sister was rough today and it kinda sucked. What he said boiled down to \"she just wants to be included and I know it's hard to include her but it's important to understand\" which is true, (I'm not trying to call my dad out for this) that is the reason for her outbursts, but at the same time when she has such bad behavioral issues it feels impossible to be around her at all. This is an assholeish thing to say but honestly I wish I wasn't related to her at all. \n\nI guess the core \"am I the asshole\" is I am away at college all year, and I have the option to spend breaks with my boyfriend's family. I love my family (excluding my sister), but every time I come back I feel awful because I truly can't stand to be around her. I don't want to talk to her.

Don't want her to visit me, don't want her to come to my graduation, don't want her to be in my wedding if I get married, don't want her to be around my kids if I have them. I want to tell my parents that I am distancing myself because of her, but my dad has always said that family has to come first, and he stopped talking to his own mother for a while because she didn't invite my sister to a family dinner.

I love her kids with my entire life and I work very hard to make sure they never go without anything they need. Sometime last year she had asked me if I could take her two oldest children (teenagers at the time) to live with me so that they can attend a better school district. I immediately accepted, (even though I was only 21 at the time I had moved out at an early age and had managed to rent a house so I can accommodate two people). Everything was great, my niece and nephew are a joy to have around and they were old enough were i didn’t have to worry about cooking or cleaning up after them too much. \n\nThe problem started about a month after them staying over, although I rent a home, I do not own it, I do not have “house” money, I work hard and budget well and never live beyond my means because if I didn’t I would not be able to afford it and she knew that but she did not offer to help with her kids expenses at ALL. She never offered to help pay for food, toiletries or anything else they might need. I lived on my own, $30 worth of groceries could last me a week and half but $80 of food could be done within five days with two teenagers!! And I knew that bringing it up to her again would only cause a fight and the last thing I wanted to do was to make the kids think they were causing any issues. They are not the problem, they gotta eat, they need clothes etc, I was just disturbed that she wouldn’t help me knowing that I was taking them in as a favor to her and that I am not making a lot of money.\n\nI worked two jobs at that point to be able to cover all the expenses. I’m not gonna lie, being a 21 year old girl responsible for two teenagers, all the bills of the house, plus maintenance of the house (mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, cleaning the bathrooms) and two full time jobs, it was getting to me and I smoked weed in my free time to help me relax. Weed has never interfered with my work ethic or with my responsibilities. Ive never called off or missed bills due to lack of money spent on drugs so it shook me to my core when my sister found out I was smoking and immediately went to my landlord to try and kick me out. She said she didn’t want me around her (grown) kids because I was going to get them addicted and show them to be lazy and bummy, I completely shut her out after that. I don’t talk to her when I see her at family events anymore and I live my life for the most part like I don’t have a sister. I still am in close contact with my niece and nephews and I see them rather frequently but it’s almost always in secret which feels shitty and like I’m missing out on a closer relationship with them because of her views.

The room is supposed to be a shared room between two people, but my roommate moved out last semester so I have the entire space to myself.\n\nBecause I'm fortunate enough to have a room to myself, my friend--we'll call her G--and I often hang out in my space after class; we have a lot of the same classes so it's nice to be able to study together whenever we want without bothering other people. I fully enjoy having G in my room and consider her an awesome and respectable friend, but lately she's been getting on my case about cleaning my space and it's beginning to get annoying.\n\nI'll be the first to admit I'm a slob; my room is by no means clean, and ever since I've had the room to myself I've taken a few liberties with the space. There's a pretty fair amount of stuff on the floor, and I recently did laundry so my clothes are sitting out in the open on the spare bed (this includes some of my underwear, but it's all folded neatly into little rolls so you can't really tell what they are). I also have dirty dishes lying around everywhere, and both my desk and the spare desk are fairly cluttered with stuff that I've left and not bothered to pick up. To be completely frank, it's gotten to the point where most open surfaces have begun to lose their functionality simply because of the sheer amount of stuff lying about on them that I'm too lazy to move.\n\nMy room is very messy, but it's not unlivable for me. I'm not even against cleaning it, but I absolutely hate that G is the one telling me to do it. She's not my mother, so I really don't feel like she has the right to tell me what to do, and anyway it's my room. If she's uncomfortable with the clutter then she doesn't have to come over--even though i honestly think my room is the best location for our study sessions because of its convenience, I would be perfectly content to meet up in her room or in the common areas of the dorm if my room is too messy for her to handle. I actually plan to clean it soon, but I want to do it on my own time and by my own volition, not because someone else told me to do so.\n\nEven so, G is in my room a lot, and I know it's probably extremely uncomfortable for her to sit around in my filth (although I do try to keep her favorite spot, a little sitting area under my bed, reasonably clean). The more she nags me, though, the less I want to do anything about the clutter. Would I be an asshole to tell her to keep out of my business, even though she's partially affected? I can tell that she's also as frustrated as I am about the situation, but I don't think I'm in the wrong to want autonomy in my own space that she's under no obligation to share with me.\n\nSo, AITA?",

We started talking shit about how insecure he was and how she needs to find someone who lets her have guy friends. We plan on discussing this with her on next monday.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

I told her I will but I need to be home by 11 bc that’s what time my parents want me back.Her parents were in the plaza at some bar but not with us.So after we are done dancing and eating I drive myself to her house and she tells me she’ll meet me there. I wait around for like 20 minutes outside her house and I’m getting a little worried for her and it’s already around 10:30. I get a text from her asking me to drive her parents home bc they were too drunk to drive. I would’ve had 0 problem with this, and I understand it’s her birthday, but I wasn’t informed at all before hand and it’s a 10 minute drive there then 10 minutes back. They offered me money after and I didn’t want it and I was being a little pissy with them bc I was already gonna be late home. They texted my parents to let me stay but I said I didn’t want to bc I wanted to respect my parents wishes. Now they are all mad at me for leaving instead of staying. I got home at 11:20 and my parents were obviously pissed at me despite her parents text. Am I the asshole for not wanting to stay and being mad at her and her parents for giving me no info about being their designated driver?\n ",
